    "text": "INTRODUCTION\n22\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThere are two key components of successful programming—putting \nfirst that which is most important and learning how to adjust each \ntraining variable while maintaining the order of things. These will be \ncovered in exceptional detail throughout this book.\n1. Prioritizing That Which Is Most Important\nThough it sounds so simple and obvious, people screw this up all the time.\nWhen you train, many different factors influence each other and cause \nthe resultant adaptations of the body. The experiences of trainees \nin gyms around the world for the last century, when combined with \nresearch over the last few decades, has enabled us to establish a fairly \nclear order of importance as to what will and won’t give you the most \nfrom your training efforts.\nWhen you see seemingly conflicting advice — which exercises to \ndo, how heavy to go, how many sets to perform, whether to train to \nfailure, lifting explosively or slowly to ‘feel the burn’ etc. — you need \nto decide how important these factors are relative to your goals, and \nhow they will affect the other aspects of your training. By looking at \nthese variables through the lens of a pyramid of importance, you’ll save \nyourself unnecessary confusion.\nAs the classic analogy goes, if you want to “fill your cup to the brim” \nwhen it comes to your training potential, get your big rocks in place \nbefore your pebbles, and your pebbles in place before your sand.\n2. Learning How to Adjust Each Training Variable\nThe next important part of achieving success with your training career \nis learning how and when to adjust the individual variables that go into \nyour program. It’s essential that you use critical thinking here and not \nthe black and white type of mindset that pervades the majority of the \ntraining industry’s commercial literature.\nHere are some examples of black and white questions that ignore context:\n}\n} Are squats the best exercise?\n}\n} Is the leg press for wimpy men that are scared to squat?\nINTRODUCTION\n23\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} Is 5x5 better than 3x8?\n}\n} Is more volume better?\n}\n} Is training twice a week enough?\n}\n} Will training every day cause me to overtrain?\nAnd now here are some examples of the type of critical thinking I’m \ngoing to teach you to use in this book:\n}\n} What is unique about the barbell squat that makes it worthy of \ninclusion in a training program? What are the limitations?\n}\n} When is the leg press appropriate?\n}\n} What set and rep patterns are appropriate for what exercises, for \nme, and when?\n}\n} How is adding sets and volume going to affect progress?\n}\n} What is the best way for me to split the appropriate training volume \nover the training week?\nWhich way of thinking is likely to lead to a better long-term outcome? \nPonder that question before moving on.\nINTRODUCTION\n24\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nINTRODUCING THE PYRAMID\nThe Pyramid is an organizational structure that places the most \nimportant priorities of training in a hierarchy. There are six parts of this \npyramid. The most important elements of your training program are \nat the bottom; notice that they have the largest area. These elements \nbuild the foundation of your training.\nMUSCLE AND STRENGTH TRAINING \nPYRAMID\nADHERENCE\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\nPROGRESSION\nEXercise SELECTION\nREST periods\nTEMPO\n 06 \n05 \n04 \n03\n02\n01\nMUSCLE & STRENGTH TRAINING PyrAMID\nPERIODIZATION\nIt is likely that ~80% of your progress will be made by focusing on these \nbottom three or four levels, and only the very small finishing touches \nwill be affected by the last levels. Most of the time, our discussion in the \nfinal levels will primarily focus on how to just prevent you from doing \nsomething wrong.\nINTRODUCTION\n25\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nUnlike The Nutrition Pyramid, the layers of The Training Pyramid are \nnot as clear cut-and-dry because of how interdependent the variables \nof training often are. However, I think this construct I’ve created will \nhelp you get to your goals in a more efficient manner, and help you \nunderstand the concepts in a more complete way with respect to \ncontext. For trainers, it will better help you develop training plans for \nyour clients, and if you’re a student I hope to take some of the theory \nyou have learned and put it into action.\nThe Hierarchy of Different Variables to Take into \nAccount When Designing a Program for Strength or \nHypertrophy\nPeriodization\nThere is a popular saying, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” Passion \nand hard work will take you far, probably further than anything else in \ntraining (and in life for that matter), but directing that passion and hard \nwork in an efficient manner over time is what develops champions.\nPeriodization is often overcomplicated and misunderstood. Simply put, \nperiodization is the intentional manipulation of variables over time to \nachieve specific goals. Organizing your training in an intelligent manner \ncan help to optimize progress and also prevent burnout and injury, \nwhich in turn further helps you make progress.\nPeriodization covers changes in variables in each level of The Pyramid \nover time. For this reason, it is placed outside of The Pyramid as it \nencompasses manipulations of all of the levels.\nNow as a brief introduction to The Pyramid, here are the levels in order \nof priority:\nLevel 1: Adherence\nStrength training is a journey which must be continued consistently for \na long time to produce meaningful results. Before losing yourself in the \nbuilding blocks of making a solid training plan, I want to remind you of \nsomething more fundamental to your success—it doesn’t matter how \ngood your programming is if you cannot stick to it.\nINTRODUCTION\n26\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWhat may be technically more optimal on paper is entirely irrelevant if \nyou don’t do it. So let go of it. Work on making the best training plan \nyou can within the confines of what you can adhere to. This chapter \nfocuses on the principles that make a training plan one you are able to \nmaintain consistently over time.\nLevel 2: Volume, Intensity, Frequency\nVolume, intensity and frequency are what actually form the foundation \nof programs. These three variables are interrelated and inseparable \nfrom each other. Each affects the other and can do so in different \ncontexts. Depending on the way you look at it, any one of these could \nbe considered the most important. For this reason, we have them all in \nthe same layer. The optimal combination of each will vary depending \non your training age, goals, preferences, schedule and current stage \nwithin your athletic career.\nThis is the longest section and covers the majority of the most important \nconcepts in this book, so make sure to read through it carefully.\nLevel 3: Progression\nIn order to keep getting bigger and stronger, you need to gradually increase \nthe training stimulus. This is called The Principle of Progressive Overload.\nIf you are a novice or early-stage intermediate lifter, simply setting up a \ntraining plan specific to your goals with an appropriate volume, intensity \nand frequency will produce gains without much additional thought \nor effort. Simply selecting weights that challenge you on a session to \nsession or week to week basis, even with the same set and repetition \nschemes within the week, will result in a gradual increase in strength \nand size. However, at a certain stage of your development, a plan for \nprogression will become important to ensure continued progress.\nThis chapter covers detailed progression theory and examples for \nnovice, intermediate and advanced trainees.\nLevel 4: Exercise Selection\nThe importance of exercise selection varies depending on perspective. \nExercise selection for strength athletes (specifically those who \nINTRODUCTION\n27\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nperform certain lifts or events in competition) is critical because their \nsport performance is actually the expression of strength via specific \nmovements. The inclusion of these competition lifts, therefore, is a \ngiven. Thus, the focus of a discussion on exercise selection for a strength \nathlete should be centered on how much time is spent training the \ncompetition lifts in relation to assistance lifts.\nFor hypertrophy, a wide variety of exercises can be used to stimulate \ngrowth. That being said, based on the biomechanics of the individual, \nsome exercises may be more effective than others. This is also a \nrelevant consideration for a strength athlete. For example, even though \na powerlifter may have to squat, in some cases the squat may not \nproduce balanced development if that specific powerlifter is not well \nbuilt to squat. Therefore, they might be better suited to doing more \nassistance work for leg development rather than more squats compared \nto someone who has limb and torso lengths well suited to squatting.\nPhysique-sport competitors must also consider not only what exercises \nbest suit their body’s lever lengths, but also how to modify their exercise \nselection to address weak points in their physique. Biomechanics, weak \npoints, and technical skill can all influence what exercises you choose to \nuse. However, in a broad sense exercise selection is primarily differentiated \nbased on the goal of your training—whether you’re training for hypertrophy \nlike a bodybuilder or training for strength like a powerlifter.\nLevel 5: Rest Periods\nHow long one rests between sets has been theorized to be an \nimportant variable for resistance training, specifically when the goal \nis hypertrophy. However, the mechanisms by which short rest intervals \nwere once thought to augment hypertrophy have been questioned \nand a solid body of research now challenges this convention. In this \nchapter, we discuss the ins and outs of rest periods and give practical \nrecommendations to help you avoid potentially degrading your training \nquality and also to potentially allow you to complete your training in a \ntime-efficient manner that optimizes performance.\nLevel 6: Lifting Tempo\nIn this final level, we discuss tempo, the speed at which you are lifting.\nINTRODUCTION\n28\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe concept of controlling tempo has gotten a lot of attention because \nit is thought to be an important aspect of hypertrophy training. Typically, \nthe reason tempo is emphasized is because of the belief that ‘time \nunder tension’ is a critical variable to maximizing muscle growth.\nWe discuss the reasons tempo has been suggested as an important \nhypertrophy training variable and then evaluate the evidence on this \ntopic before I finally give you some recommendations.\nADHERENCE\n30\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nBefore losing yourself in the coming levels, the building blocks of \nwhat goes into making a solid training plan, I want to remind you of \nsomething more fundamental to your success—it doesn’t matter how \ngood your programming is if you cannot stick to it.\nLet’s discuss what makes adherence possible. Yes, some of this may \nseem obvious, but do yourself a favor and read it anyway so that you \ndon’t set yourself up for failure before you even start, as so many do.\nThe Three Important Conditions for Training Adherence\nTraining needs to be:\n}\n} Realistic\n}\n} Enjoyable\n}\n} Flexible\nThese are common to a lot of things, not just specific to strength \ntraining.\nNow, there are people that are convinced they have an iron will and can \nhandle anything, right? You might be one of those people. However, this \ntype of thinking misses the point. When you set up a training program \nthere is nothing impressive about choosing something that cannot \nbe sustained. We all want fast progress, but until you commit to the \nlong haul you will never realize your full potential. Understanding this \ntruth will help you make far fewer mistakes in the long run, and reach \nyour goals much more efficiently. It just requires some self-restraint \nand self-awareness. There are situations where will and determination \nalone simply will not cut it, or if a situation does require it, we need to \nunderstand how that impacts other aspects of our lives and training. \nThis is something we need to continually bear in mind.\nADHERENCE\n31\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nRealistic: Is Your Training Schedule Sustainable and \nPractical?\nTime Frame\nThe first thing that needs to be considered when planning training is \nour schedule and time frame.\nBodybuilders and powerlifters with a specific competition date need to \nhave a realistic plan based on the time frame they have before their \ncontest. If you have 8 weeks until a meet, or 24 weeks until a bodybuilding \nshow, you have to design your training plan built around this time frame.\nEven for the recreational trainee, if your target is to look good on the \nbeach next summer, you need to start planning now how long you will \nbe gaining and when you need to start your cut, and how your training \nshould fit in with these goals.\nIn short, you need to match up the time frames you are dealing with \nin real life, to the training approach you are considering. Though this \nmay sound obvious, it’s something that people miss. Often this occurs \nbecause the average lifter doesn’t know how to design their own \ntraining program. So, they try to fit an 8-week cookie cutter program \ninto their own 6-week time frame and run into problems. But, you are \ndifferent. You bought this book because you are tired of banging your \nhead against the wall. You want to actually learn how to set up your \ntraining rather than mindlessly follow a cookie cutter plan. So, make \nsure you consider a realistic time frame.\nSchedule\nYou also need to think about your schedule on a week-to-week and \nday-to-day basis.\nIf you have decided that the “optimal approach” is training 6 days a \nweek for two hours a day like your favorite bodybuilder, yet you are \na father who works 50 hours a week, has a hobby, and tends to have \nfamily commitments on the weekends, that may not be realistic.\nYou have to start with what you can do before you decide what you \nshould do.\nADHERENCE\n32\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nRemember that “optimal” is not necessarily the same thing as “realistic”. \nAlways think about fitting your training program to what is sustainable \nand realistic in your life first, before assessing anything else.\nIf you think that a 5 day a week training program would be perfect but \nyou only have time to train 4 days a week —it’s not an option, let go of \nit! Focus on what you can do in the days you have available.\nIt’s essential to think about what we are realistically able to do in the \nlong term as well. That which on paper looks the best but makes us fall \noff the wagon on a regular basis is going to produce a worse outcome \nthan something slightly suboptimal that we can adhere to.\nRemember, consistency is what makes progress rather than perfection.\nEnjoyable: Can You Enjoy Training This Way for a \nLong Period of Time?\nWhen you have the “realistic” part in check, the next thing to think \nabout is this “enjoyable” part.\nSo why is enjoyment so important? I guarantee you that if you take a \nsuboptimal plan that you love, you’ll put more effort into it than if you take \nan optimal plan that doesn’t get your juices and your passion flowing.\nTo take a modern example, think of the rise of Crossfit. It’s been \nsuccessful for a reason — people are joining Crossfit gyms and making \nbetter progress than they ever have done in years. Why would this \nbe? — Because they’re enjoying their training more and thus putting in \nmore effort. Perhaps the camaraderie was the thing they lacked before, \nnot the quality of the programming.\nYou always want to think about how you are going to make the \nguidelines fit what you will enjoy. We’re not all robots — whether or not \nwe are motivated has a huge impact on adherence and ultimately the \nresults we achieve. Seeing progress will make training more enjoyable \nand easier to continue with. Setting up your training around not only \nsound principles but also personal enjoyment can help you create a \npositive cycle of enjoyment driving harder training, producing results, \nwhich in turn, drives even more enjoyment.\nADHERENCE\n33\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nE\nN\nJ\nO\nY\nM\nE\nN\nT\t\nH\nA\nR\nD\nE\nR\n \nT\nR\nA\nI\nN\nI\nN\nG\t\nR\nE\nS\nU\nL\nT\nS\nNow, for some people, whatever gets them the fastest progress and \ncloser to their goals is what they are going to love (a lot of athletes \nare like that). However, for everyone else, we have to make sure that \nwe pay just as much heed to what will produce enjoyment as what \nwill produce progress. In fact, sometimes focusing all your energy on \nachieving a goal, rather than the process of achieving the goal itself \ncan undermine your efforts.\nOne study found just this to be the case; two groups were compared, \none that focused all their attention specifically on the end-goal related \nto performing the selected task, while the other focused on the process \nof performing the task itself. The “end-goal” group was instructed to \ntry to self-motivate by focusing on what they would eventually achieve \nby doing the task, while the “process-oriented” group was instructed \nto focus on the positive feelings they had while performing the task. \nAn example in fitness would be focusing on eventually setting a new \npersonal best on your squat one-rep max, versus focusing on how the \nact of squatting makes you feel strong and productive. Surprisingly, \nat the end of the study, the group that focused on goal-pursuit, rather \nADHERENCE\n34\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthan the process actually achieved their goals with less consistency \n[1]! So the take-home is that you have to learn to enjoy the process. A \nmindset of program design based purely on what is the most “optimal” \nway to reach your end-goals might set you up for failure.\nThink back to the previous section’s example of the family man — if \nhis training plan is thoroughly enjoyable, but so time intensive that it is \nputting a strain on his marriage and his relationship with his children, \neventually this is going to take away from his enjoyment of his training, \nhis stress levels will rise, sleep will suffer, and this will negatively impact \nthe results — you have to question if it’s worth it.\nHow many aging recreational bodybuilders are out there that silently \nregret being down at the gym so often because they were convinced \nthey needed to have a six-day body part split? How much of this refusal \nto change is based on their unwillingness to acknowledge this?\nThe point I want to make is that there is a lot of wiggle room in determining \nwhat is best for you, and a huge amount of individual variation. This is \nwhy I’m not just giving you “the” workout plan, because it doesn’t exist. \nI’m giving you the principles to build your training around.\nOptimal does not equal sustainable — don’t set yourself up for failure.\nAn Aside: Is There Any Such Thing as “Optimal”?\nWe don’t really know what optimal is. There is no way to know. \nAs scientists we try to continually push knowledge forward but, \noptimal remains a pie in the sky idea.\nThere is nothing wrong with reaching for more and trying your \nhardest, but don’t fall into the trap of constantly questioning and \nchanging what you are doing in the pursuit of the magic “optimal” \nformula. You will always be able to convince yourself “I should be \nprogressing faster”, and this mindset leaves you susceptible to the \n“magic formula” marketing that is so common in the fitness industry.\nADHERENCE\n35\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nFlexible: Do You Have Flexibility in Your Program to \nAccommodate the Unexpected and Move Forward?\nFlexibility is a requirement of the previous two conditions. It allows you \nto enjoy your training and allows it to be realistic.\nIf you are in this game for the long haul there will be times when you \nstruggle to train as planned. Maybe work gets in the way, or there is \na schedule change due to some family commitment — when these \nthings happen it’s important to have the flexibility to accommodate \nthe changes and keep making progress towards your goals without \ngiving up or program hopping blindly.\nFlexibility is, in a large part, a state of mind, and this can be achieved \nby equipping yourself with knowledge of the principles in this book. \nYou’ll learn how to make these adjustments to your training while still \nkeeping the goal, the goal, in the subsequent sections.\nFlexibility When Stress is High\nIn a broad sense, the body receives many different types of stress \ncollectively. Training, dieting, sleep deprivation, work, worries etc. — to \nthe body they are all stressors.\nWhile trainers and coaches would love to believe that the vast majority of \nthe stresses you experience that affect your progress are all related to the \nthings they can control (myself included), this just isn’t the case. In fact, \nthere is a study that shows that people who experience more negative life \noccurrences in the course of a training program don’t adapt to it as well [2].\nSo while you can try to control for all the variables in the various levels \nin The Pyramid, it’s important to also acknowledge the impact of the \nlife stressors that you cannot control.\nFor example, if you have a lot of pressure at work, have trouble with your \ncoworkers, a family member passes away, you divorce etc., anything \nthat you can imagine, remember those stresses have an impact on your \ntraining.\nThat’s why auto-regulating your training (developing structured \nflexibility in your approach) can be very useful so that your training \nstress matches your ability to manage stress. (We’ll discuss auto-\nADHERENCE\n36\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nregulatory methods in later chapters as well.)\nFlexibility to Adjust Based on Energy Levels\nSo what does this mean to you? How can you implement elements of \nflexibility into your training? Well, there’s a study where the participants \nwere divided into two groups. One group was given three training \noptions to choose from according to their energy level each day they \ntrained: an easy, moderate, and a hard session. The other group did \nthe same sessions, but in a pre-planned order every day they trained, \nregardless of how they felt.\nThe volume was matched so that by the end of the 12-week study both \ngroups had performed the same volume of training. The group with the \nflexible periodization approach still completed all the sessions, but the \nflexible group that chose their training on a day-to-day basis based on \nhow they felt, made greater strength gains than the pre-planned group \n[3]. Likewise, in a follow-up study, it was observed that when trained \nlifters could choose whether the weekly order of strength, hypertrophy, \nor power training based on their perceived readiness, they had better \nadherence than a group following a fixed order [4].\nSo what’s the take-home message? Firstly, we know stress can affect \nprogress in the gym. Secondly, we know that having a flexible approach \nto periodization can be superior to having a rigid one (not unlike dieting). \nSo, once you have set up your training schedule, sure, follow it as planned \nwhen you are able. But, if you have a day where you feel terrible, weak, \nand depleted of energy, do the easiest workout you had planned for the \nweek instead. Now this isn’t the only way to implement a flexible approach \ninto your training, and we’ll cover more ways to do so throughout this \nbook, but hopefully, it helps to shift your mindset to look at the big picture \nversus just the sets and reps in front of you on any given day.\nLife Doesn’t Stop for Lifting\nThe importance of realism, being flexible, and discussing adherence \nis often lost on people until they are faced with concrete personal \nexperiences which force them into less-than-optimal situations. It’s \nimportant to point out that most of the time when people are forced \nADHERENCE\n37\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ninto a situation when they can’t adhere to the exact plan they’ve \nestablished, the real issue is not the situation itself, but how they react \nto it. What I mean is that vacations, injuries, travel, sports you might play \nrecreationally or competitively, and unexpected work commitments \nare not the problem. Rather, the stress, indecision, overreaction and \nemotional decisions made in response to these minor hiccups are.\nYou may have heard the popular military quote, “No plan survives \ncontact with the enemy.” Obviously, I’m not saying you are a soldier \ngoing into war, but I think there is a parallel when people with families, \ncareers, schedules, stresses and hobbies undertake a serious training \nplan. If you were a young, single, full-time athlete living at a high-\nperformance sports training facility who was paid to train, and you could \ncordon yourself off from outside stressors and your sport was your life, \nmaybe “optimal” and “realistic” would be much closer together. In my \nexperience as a coach and trainer, many lifters pretend this is their \nsituation when it’s absolutely not, overlooking the reality that something \ncould derail them. Then, when these lifters are faced with the thing that \ndoes (inevitably) derail them, they are wholly unprepared to adapt. \nTherefore, in the following sections, I’m going to outline some of the \nmost common situations and questions related to “life happening” and \nmy perspective on how to best handle each.\n“What happens if I miss a workout?”\nThis is not a situation per se, but rather the most common result of \nmany things that could disrupt your intended training schedule. While \nit is the most common problem, fortunately, it’s also one of the most \neasily solved. In general, the solution I recommend to a missed session \nis just picking up where you left off next time you go to the gym. Yes, \nyes, I know you have a set schedule with a specific workout to do on \nspecific days, but there is nothing that says you have to do it that way. \nIf you train on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for example, and you \nmiss a Wednesday workout, just do Wednesday’s workout on Friday. \nI know, you’re thinking, “But I’ll be behind!” and my response would \nbe—so what? Just finish the training plan a few days later than you \ninitially intended, it makes almost no difference in the long run, and \nwith certain setups, the alternative choice of cramming multiple days \ntogether (especially in a more intense phase of training) could be the \nADHERENCE\n38\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ngreater of the two evils. \nThe only time simply picking up where you left off could be a problem, \nis when you’re preparing for a competition. You can’t very well ask \nthe meet director to delay the competition from Saturday to Monday \nbecause in week two of your build up you had to push Wednesday’s \nsession back to Friday. In this case, you will need to either skip a session \nor rejig things to accommodate the missed session in the current or \nfollowing week—but which should you do?\nSkipping sessions is a good option when the missed session is something \nthat was an intended low-stress session. Examples are if it was your \naccessory day as a powerlifter, a day of grip work, calves and arms \nas a bodybuilder, or perhaps a ‘power day’ where you did a handful \nof singles at ~80% for technique work. In these cases, a good portion \nof that session’s goal was active recovery, while also putting in a bit \nof useful work. By skipping the day, you are still achieving the goal of \nrecovery, and you are only missing out on a small stimulus. That being \nsaid, given the stress is so low in sessions such as this, if you can make \na previously unscheduled trip to the gym on Thursday, Saturday, or \nSunday to make up the session, it’s unlikely to negatively affect the \nfollowing workout.\nOn that note, even if you were to do multiple hard sessions back to back, \nwhile probably not ideal, it’s actually not as bad as you might think. There \nare now three studies I’m aware of where programs differentiated only \nby whether they were performed on consecutive days within a week \n(i.e. three days in a row), or with days off between sessions, resulted in \nsimilar strength and hypertrophy adaptations among groups [5–7].\nThus, if you have to occasionally do something like train Monday, \nThursday, Friday or Monday, Friday, Saturday, it’s unlikely to be a big \ndeal. When this does happen, however, simply be prepared to not \nbe 100% when you come in for the second session. Drop your loads \nappropriately so that the intended effort is where it should be, rather \nthan rigidly sticking to the load you had listed in your excel sheet or \nthat you had planned in your head (more on this later). This will allow \nyou to actually get through the volume, without risking setting yourself \nback from really overdoing it.\nADHERENCE\n39\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nSport, Outdoor, and Fitness Activities Outside of Lifting\nIt’s not uncommon for a lifter to love hiking, to be a group exercise \ninstructor, to play in a recreational sports league, or to take martial arts \nclasses in addition to training. Unfortunately for folks in this situation, most \npowerlifting and bodybuilding programs are written with the assumption \nthat pretty much all you do physical activity-wise is the lifting itself.\nWhile in a strict sense avoiding outside activity could be argued to \nbe optimal for strength or hypertrophy, I would argue that being a \nhappy, well-rounded person might be even more optimal if you look at \nit globally (which you always should).\nConsider the known positive effects of being outdoors, making \nmeaningful human connections, belonging to a community, and the \nsubsequent stress relief and joy that comes from these activities [8–\n10]. If well managed, I would guess the positive effects of participating \nin these activities would outweigh the negatives quite easily. The only \ntime you get into trouble is when you take your sport, fitness or outdoor \nactivities just as seriously as lifting, and don’t consider moderating \neither, and treat each like it occurs in a vacuum. Team sport athletes who \nhave to do aerobic, anaerobic, plyometric, sport-specific and strength \ntraining all in the same week, heavily rely on periodization strategies to \nmanage these overlapping stresses. Thus, it’s probably a good idea for \nyou to make some concessions as well if you are going to be seriously \ninvolved in both lifting and another physically demanding activity. \nLater in this book, I’ll discuss how to manage the simultaneous goals \nof competing in both strength and physique sports, but for those \nattempting to combine lifting with another sport, it’s important to note \nthat I think one has to take priority. For example, these days almost all \nathletes do some lifting to enhance their sport performance; however, \nthey are doing just that—lifting to enhance their sport performance. \nMeaning, their mindset is always that lifting comes as an addendum \nto sport, and it is intended to serve sport performance. Thus, avoiding \nhigh-risk exercises, staying away from failure, finding the minimal \nvolume and intensity necessary to improve sport performance, and \navoiding soreness are all of paramount importance. A high-level \ndedicated soccer player shouldn’t try to find the optimal bodybuilding \nor powerlifting program to do in concert with their sport as it would \nADHERENCE\n40\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nviolate this principle. Likewise, a dedicated competitive powerlifter or \nbodybuilder who plays soccer recreationally shouldn’t find the optimal \naerobic, anaerobic, and sport-specific conditioning program to do in \nconcert with their competitive lifting pursuits.\nSo, let’s say you’re on board with keeping your non-lifting activities to \na reasonable volume and level of effort; you might still wonder how \nto balance your activity with lifting. Fortunately, we have some good \ndata on what’s called the ‘interference effect’, which is essentially the \npotential negative effect of cardiorespiratory training on strength \ntraining adaptations. Unfortunately, the interference effect is a real thing, \nwhich makes sense considering we have a spectrum of energy systems \nto perform muscular work. Meaning, getting physiologically efficient at \nsustaining low levels of force for a long period (i.e. the adaptations to \nendurance training) can run counter to getting physiologically efficient \nat outputting high levels of force for a short period (i.e. the adaptations \nto strength training).\nBut before you freak out, let’s put it into context. The interference \neffect doesn’t make you lose gains, or even stop making gains, rather \nthe collective research shows it just slows your rate of gains down. \nHowever, you can greatly mitigate the interference effects with just \na bit of planning and foresight. In general, the literature comes to \npretty common-sense conclusions; if you do hard cardio (or activity) \nimmediately before training, it’s probably going to hinder your ability \nto train and subsequently adapt.\nIf you do your cardio immediately after lifting, the interference effect is \nless. If you can place your lifting at least six hours prior to cardio, that’s \neven better, and probably the best choice is to separate lifting and \ncardio by a full day if possible [11].\nInjury\nUnfortunately, serious resistance training can result in injury. Fortunately, \nthe risk is not that high and I would argue the health benefits of a life that \nincludes lifting far outweigh the negative effects of the injuries you might \nsustain along the way. But what are the risks? In the table below, you can \nsee the data we have on injuries per 1000 hours among strength athletes. \nIn fact, fewer injuries occur during bodybuilding training compared to \nADHERENCE\n41\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmost non-contact team sports and endurance training, while powerlifting, \nweightlifting and CrossFit (you heard me right, you hater) all have similar \nrates of injuries to these sports and endurance training. \nSTRENGTH SPORT INJURY RATES AS REPORTED BY KEOGH AND \nWINWOOD [12] AND AASA ET AL. [13]\nBodybuilding\n0.24–1 injuries/1000 hours [12]\nPowerlifting\n1.0–5.8 injuries/1000 hours [12]\n1.0–4.4 injuries/1000 hours [13]\nWeightlifting\n2.4–3.3 injuries/1000 hours [12, 13]\nCrossFit\n3.1 injuries/1000 hours [12]\nStrongman\n4.5–6.1 injuries/1000 hours [12]\nHighland Games\n7.5 injuries/1000 hours [12]\nAs a comparison to the strength sport injury rates shown in the \ntable, consider that some studies report an injury rate of 8.5 to 11.1 \ninjuries/1000 hours in basketball [14]! The reality is that an injury is \nalmost guaranteed to happen at some point in your lifting lifespan if \nyou take it seriously; however, comparatively the risks are lower than \nthey are in most mainstream sports. More importantly, when you think \nabout the alternative you realize this is not something to worry about \n(remember, being sedentary exposes you to injury as well, and other \nhealth complications for that matter). The question is, what do you do \nabout it when it happens? Well for one, I am not a physical therapist or \nmedical doctor. (If I was on a plane and an attendant asked: “Is there \na doctor onboard?” I would raise my hand and yell, “Yes! What do you \nwant to know about protein or RPE?”) If you get a significant injury, \nseek out a physical therapist or sports injury doctor, preferably one \nwho has specific experience working with athletes (ideally, lifters). I am \nshocked when I see people posting comments on my Instagram asking \nADHERENCE\n42\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwhat they should do about an injury...that’s absolutely not treating your \ninjury seriously; I’m not a specialist and even if I was, social media is not \nthe appropriate venue for diagnosis or treatment.\nWith that said, not all injuries are serious, and aches, pains, strains, \nniggles, irritations and general stiffness are at times, part and parcel \nof the serious lifter’s experience. When these gremlins pop up, it’s \nimportant that you don’t make poor decisions that lead to something \nminor becoming something major that requires serious medical \nintervention. Don’t just train through pain. On the other hand, don’t let \nfear make you irrationally conservative. I’ve seen people with a lower \nback strain, staying out of the gym completely for weeks, or people \nwith an upper-body issue not training legs, etc. At 3DMJ we’ve prepped \nathletes who you’d never know had a lower-back injury in the middle of \n‘prep’ (a caloric deficit) mind you, who had to stick to hip thrusts, leg \nextensions, and leg curls for lower body training, and replace much of \ntheir upper body free weight training with machines...who won shows!\nSo, where is this middle ground? First, if it hurts don’t do it. Alter \nthe range of motion, reduce the load, or replace the movement with \nsomething comparable that is pain-free. In the case of some (mainly \nsingle joint) movements, blood flow restriction (BFR) can be used to \nallow you to reduce the load a great deal (as low as 20% 1RM) while \nstill getting a solid hypertrophy stimulus (more on this later if you don’t \nknow what BFR is). Finally, if you can’t easily work around it or if the \npain isn’t gone in a matter of weeks, I would see a specialist.\nSummary\nTo sum it up, remember the acronym REF—realistic, enjoyable and \nflexible. It takes self-awareness and restraint to be able to appropriately \nimplement these philosophies into program design, so be sure to “REF \nyourself” throughout the process. We are not robots, “optimal” is a \nconcept that doesn’t always fit into our realities and the stresses we \nexperience in life are largely out of our hands. Therefore, you need to \nbe sure that the program you develop is specific to your individual \nlife circumstances, considers your individual preferences, and is flexible \nenough to account for any curve balls life throws your way.\nADHERENCE\n43\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nReferences\n1. \u0007Fishbach, A. and J.

These three variables are interrelated and inseparable from \neach other. Each affects the other and can do so in different contexts. \n}\n} If you train at a very high intensity of effort, near to failure, it takes \nlonger for muscle damage to subside (exercise-induced muscle \ndamage is the normal, easily repaired disruption to the fiber as a \nresult of high tension or high volumes; in excess it interferes with \nperformance and adaptation) and performance to recover back to \nbaseline, potentially impacting the frequency you can train with.\n}\n} Likewise, lifting heavy (a high intensity of load) makes each \nindividual repetition more stressful, requires longer rest periods, \nand can make a session take longer, limiting the volume you can \n(and probably should) perform.\n}\n} As a final example, doing 16 sets of the same movement in a single \nday would require you to either decrease volume (do less reps per \nset) or intensity (drop the load) due to cumulative fatigue as sets \nwent on, to a greater extent than compared to doing 8 sets on two \ndifferent days in the week.\nSince these three variables are interdependent, they are all in the \nsame layer of The Pyramid. The optimal combination of each will vary \ndepending on your training age, goals, preferences, schedule and \ncurrent stage within your athletic career.\nThis is a long section and covers the majority of the most important \nconcepts in this book, so make sure to read through it carefully. Given \nthe length and detail of this section, let’s start with an overview of \nthe recommended ranges where most novice and intermediate lifters \nshould start for volume, intensity and frequency, and then go through \nall of the rationale for how we ended up here:\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n47\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nVolume • Intensity • Frequency\nSummary of Starting Recommendations\nVolume:\t\n10–20 sets per muscle group/movement pattern \nper week\nIntensity:\t\nStrength: ⅔–¾ of volume in the 1–6 rep range, \nremaining volume in the 6–15 rep range at a 5–10 \nRPE \nHypertrophy: ⅔–¾ of volume in the 6–12 rep \nrange, remaining volume in the 1–6 and 12–20 rep \nrange at a 5–10 RPE\nFrequency:\t2+ times per muscle group/movement pattern \nper week\nVOLUME\nVolume is the total amount of work performed, and to a point, shares \na non-linear relationship with adaptation (more on this to come). It can \nbe counted as ‘volume load’ (sets x reps x load), the total number of \nrepetitions (sets x reps), or simply as the number of sets. Each counting \nmethod has its strengths and weaknesses. High-rep sets make volume \nload skyrocket.\n1RM\nVolume Load vs. Number of Sets\nHeavy\nModerate\nLight\n6RM\n12RM\n30RM\nVolume Load the same, Sets differ.\nExample: \n7 sets x 3 reps x 100 lbs = 2100 lbs\n3 sets x 10 reps x 70 lbs = 2100 lbs\nSets the same, Volume Load differs.\nExample: \n3 sets x 10 reps x 70 lbs = 2100 lbs\n3 sets x 30 reps x 40 lbs = 3600 lbs\nConsider 3x25x100 — 3 sets of 25 reps with a 100 lb or kg load, which is \n50% of a 1 rep max (1RM) in this imaginary example — versus 3x10x140 \n(70% of 1RM). The former produces a volume load of 7500 and the latter \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n48\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n4200, 78% more volume is produced with the high rep set. But is that \nrepresentative of anything? Would you get 78% more hypertrophy or \nstrength or experience that much more fatigue? No. We have data showing \nthat sets of 8–12RM produce just as much hypertrophy on a set-to-set \nbasis as sets of 25–35RM [1], and despite producing drastically less volume \nload, 3 sets of 2–4RM increases strength more than 3 sets of 8–12RM [2].\nThis issue is even more magnified when you just use total repetitions, \nconsider the same example and you’re comparing 75 to 30 repetitions, \na more than two-fold difference! For this reason, we’ll be quantifying \nvolume as the number of sets performed in a given intensity range \n(both effort and load) and I’ll explain why this is the best available \noption later in this chapter. \nThe Relationship Between Strength and Hypertrophy\nWe’ll cover the following two points in more detail in the Intensity \nsection, but for now, here’s what is important:\n1. Strength is a Product of Skill Acquisition, Neurological\nAdaptation, and Hypertrophy\nHow strong we are is a function of multiple factors—muscle mass \n(and other morphological factors), neurological adaptations, and how \nfamiliar we are with an exercise [3]. This means that volume is very \nimportant because it is not just the amount of work that we do, but \nalso the amount of practice we get.\nStrength is specific to a movement [4] and a rep range [1], so the more \ntime you get moving loads with a specific exercise and a specific rep \nrange, the stronger you will get on that specific exercise, in that specific \nrep range, with that specific load.\n2. Volume is Important for Hypertrophy\nHypertrophy, on the other hand, is primarily related to the total work \nperformed and is less specific to the intensity range [5] or the movement \nperformed [6]. We can make our muscles grow using various exercises \nand various repetition ranges and loads.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n49\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nCounting Volume for Strength and Hypertrophy\nAs I mentioned in the first section of this chapter, counting sets is probably \nthe easiest and most effective way to quantify volume and has the added \nbonus of making volume adjustments and program writing simpler.\nOver the years, meta-analyses (a statistical analysis of all the relevant \nresearch on a topic, “a study of studies”) have established that as \nthe number of sets increase, both strength [7] and hypertrophy [8] \nadaptations are enhanced as well (up to a point, more on this shortly). \nAlso, to skip ahead a bit to the intensity section of this chapter, the rep-\nrange used in a given set can be quite broad for the goal of hypertrophy.\nAuthors of a 2018 systematic review [9] pointed out that in the ~6–20 \nrep range, when sets are adequately hard (near enough to failure), it \nseems that number of sets is a strong predictor of hypertrophy and that \nif all else was equal, 3x6–8 would probably produce similar hypertrophy \nto 3x15–20. Briefly, if you do a low-load high-rep set, each individual \nrep provides less tension, but you can do more reps and as fatigue \nbuilds, more muscle fibers are forced to come to the party. Thus, the \nnet stimulus ends up being similar to a high-load lower-rep set where \neach rep stimulates most, if not all fibers, but doesn’t last as long—the \nonly caveat is that too few reps in a set (less than ~6) doesn’t allow \nenough time/repetitions to get a full stimulus.\nFor strength, it’s similar. While it is true that there is a relationship with \nthe number of sets and strength development, unlike hypertrophy [8], \nthe magnitude of this relationship is weaker. Specifically, the differences \nbetween the effects of 1–4, 5–9, and 10–12 sets per week on strength, \nare only statistically clear when comparing 1–4 vs. 5–12 sets, and while \npresent, only statistically qualify as being “small” differences [7].\nHypertrophy is just one of many components of strength and as I \nmentioned in the previous section, strength is highly specific to the rep \nrange you train with. This is important because strength is measured \nvia a 1RM in research. Meaning, if all else were equal and you compared \na matched number of sets of moderately heavy training in the 3–5 rep \nrange to very heavy sets in the 1–3 rep range, you might end up getting a \nsimilar strength response. Why? Because the 3–5 rep training (probably \n80–85% 1RM) is less specific than the 1–3 rep training (probably 90–\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n50\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n95% 1RM) compared to the strength test: 100% of 1RM. But, the 3–5 rep \ntraining produces almost twice the reps and time spent contracting \nwith maximal force (since both are really heavy) compared to the 1–3 \nrep per set training. Meaning, if sets were equated you’d expect to get \na greater hypertrophy response from doing 3–5 reps per set, which \nmight make up for the slightly lessened neuromuscular adaptations \ndue to being less specific, resulting in similar net strength gains just via \nslightly different mechanisms. \nWhen you get to the progression chapter and sample strength programs, \nyou’ll see how you can try to target the various physiological mechanisms \nwhich maximize strength through blocks of training with slightly different, \nbut complementary volume, intensity, and frequency setups.\nTo sum things up, a valid, practical and effective way to track volume \nfor both hypertrophy and strength is to count the number of sets \nperformed in a given “intensity zone” or rep range, as the number of \nsets loosely represents the stimulus, up to a point. \nStrength, Hypertrophy and Volume —  \nA Dose-Response Relationship Up to a Point\nLooking at studies with matched intensities and frequencies, it’s \napparent that strength [10] and hypertrophy [11] have a dose-response \nrelationship with volume. Meaning, as you do more volume, you gain \nmore strength and hypertrophy. \nHowever, this is by no means a linear relationship. Indeed, the initial \nsets you perform give you “more bang for your buck” and as you pile \non more sets, your return on investment diminishes further and further. \nEventually, you get to a point where as you add sets no additional \nprogress is made, then if you continue to add sets, progress comes \nslower than if you were doing fewer sets. Eventually, if you keep adding \nsets, you can overdo it so much that you actually plateau, making no \nprogress or even regressing. \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n51\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOLUME AND PROGRESS\nEffective Training\nOver-reaching if fatigue is managed, non functional over-reaching if is not\nNon functional over-reaching leading to over training if unmanaged\nVOLUME\nPROGRESS\nVolume level that has a \ndose-response relationship \nwith progress\nVolume level where\nprogress plateaus despite \nvolume increases\nVolume level where rate \nof progress declines \nwith volume increases\nDemonstrating this “U-shaped” relationship between volume and \nprogress, there are studies where greater gains in strength [12] and \nhypertrophy [13] are observed in moderate volume groups compared \nto both lower and higher volume groups. \nFurthermore, illustrating the far right of this U-shaped relationship \n(where you really don’t want to be), there are studies where very high \nvolume groups actually made no progress compared to baseline [14] or \neven regressed [15], while a lower volume group made more progress. \nWhat this demonstrates is that increasing volume too much can lead to \na fatigued state where there is an imbalance of fitness and fatigue. We \ncall this ‘non-functional overreaching’ If left unchecked or if the volume \nis pushed further, eventually a state of ‘overtraining’ can occur (more \non these terms to come). \nEssentially, this means reaching a state where each additional increase \nof volume actually has a negative effect as it eats into recuperative \nabilities [16]. So yes, we could add sets almost endlessly by taking long \nrest intervals, quitting our jobs and reducing the weight as needed to \nkeep doing more reps, but that is neither time-efficient nor advisable. \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n52\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nVolume, as a general rule, will need to increase over a training career; \nhowever, it should only increase when and as needed to progress.\nThe Fitness-Fatigue Model\nTo help you understand the relationship between volume and progress, \nand why more is not always better, let’s discuss what is known as the \nFitness-Fatigue Model.\nAs the name would suggest, this is a two-factor model looking at both \nfitness and fatigue. Both are generated from training; fatigue masks fitness \nand therefore affects performance [17]. Let’s quickly define those terms:\n}\n} Fitness is the physical capability that we have achieved as a result \nof training. As we continue to effectively train, it improves gradually \nover time.\n}\n} Fatigue is also a result of training. It is generated in proportion \nto the workload and the intensity of the workload performed. It \nis also generated based on how fatigue resistant you are. Fatigue \nresistance, or workload capacity, increases over time as you adapt \nto greater and greater training stresses. However, fatigue resistance \n(your ability to recover) can also be hindered or helped by external \nfactors such as sleep, nutrition, life stress, menstrual cycle phase, \nand other environmental factors.\n}\n} Performance is Fitness minus Fatigue. Now, other external factors \nalso affect performance, like when the gym is too hot, using \nequipment that you are unfamiliar with, or when you are mentally \naffected by other stresses or distractions not related to training. \nTherefore, you cannot completely isolate your performance to the \nbalance of fitness and fatigue, but their relationship is one of the \nlargest components determining performance.\nAcutely, when you train hard and get tired it is intuitively obvious that \nyou cannot lift as heavy or as many times as when you are fresh. Think \nabout if you squat your one rep max, drop the weight by 20% and bang \nout a set of five, sprint around a 400-meter track, and then come back \nto the squat rack—your one rep max is going to be considerably less in \nthis “fatigued” state. However, if you give yourself time to recover you \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n53\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ncould do it again.\nThe Fitness-Fatigue Model helps to capture this effect on a session to \nsession basis, over the course of a typical training week, and over the \ncourse of a training cycle. It is exceptionally useful in helping to explain \nnot only the importance of breaks between training sessions but why \nwe need to include some periodization in our training plans and why \nvolume should not just be added endlessly on a whim.\nEFFECT OF A SINGLE SESSION ON FITNESS AND PERFORMANCE\nFitness\nBefore Training\nPost Training\nAfter Recovery \nTime\nTIME\nFatigue\nPerformance\nIn the graph, you can see that before training, there is a small level of \nresidual fatigue from previous training sessions. Post training, fitness \nincreases due to the training effect, but fatigue increases also, masking \nthe positive effect on performance. After some recovery time, fatigue \ndrops to baseline and the increase to performance is apparent (shown \nby the increase in the size of the yellow performance bar overall).\nNormal Adaptations to Training\nWith normal adaptations to training, performance increases over time. \nHowever, if we look at the performance changes in a single week’s time \nframe, we can see that the performance curve fluctuates despite fitness \nincreasing due to the effect of fatigue.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n54\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nTHE FITNESS-FATIGUE MODEL — CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE \nOVER A TYPICAL WEEK\nFitness\nPerformance\nFatigue\nWith each training session, both fitness and fatigue go up, but then \nas the latter dissipates this will prompt a rise in performance. Over a \nlarger time frame, if progressive overload is continually applied, the \nperformance curve will continue upward with the fitness line. Well, \nideally that is, but of course, things aren’t always that simple.\nOverreaching and Overtraining\nAs you train you develop both fitness and fatigue; however, to advance \nin training age the push to create progressive overload often results in \nthe accumulation of residual fatigue. When residual fatigue surpasses \nyour increases in fitness, performance will be negatively affected—you \nwon’t be able to train as hard or as heavy.\nThere are two outcomes that can occur at this point, one being an \nextension of the other.\nThe first outcome is that you enter a state of  ‘overreaching’. In this \ncase if you let the fatigue dissipate with planned lower stress days \nor weeks that are incorporated into a periodized plan (often called \n‘deloads’), performance comes back, and hopefully returns to a level \nthat you perhaps couldn’t have achieved if you had not overreached in \nthe first place [18]. Meaning, overload is required to drive adaptation in \nexperienced lifters, and overload also produces fatigue, which acutely \nsuppresses performance. This fatigue needs to be managed, and if \nthe balance between recovery and overload is appropriate, it should \nresult in an increase in performance. This type of overreaching would \nbe deemed ‘functional’.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n55\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nOn the other hand, if performance was not enhanced, but simply returned \nto baseline or didn’t result in any better outcome than had you not \noverreached in the first place, that would be considered ‘nonfunctional’. \nIt’s worth pointing out, that there are always normal fluctuations in \ntraining performance, and in fact, training in a “fatigued state” is not \nnecessarily a bad thing. Depending on training age, the time frame of \nyour goals, your workload capacity, and the structure of your training, \ntraining in a fatigued state may be a normal or necessary occurrence. \nHowever, at some point, dictated by the periodization strategy being \nemployed, performance should be seen to eventually improve.\nThe second outcome is an extreme extension of overreaching, and \nthat is overtraining. In this case, fatigue has gotten so high that it \nprevents you from doing training of a high enough quality to increase \nor even maintain fitness, and you start to regress. This rarely occurs \nwith resistance training, takes a longer period of time to reach this \nstate, and subsequently requires a longer period than a simple taper or \ndeload to resolve [16].\nPersonally, I have only seen resistance-trained athletes reach this state in \ntwo populations, competitive bodybuilders during contest preparation \nand CrossFit competitors who have to balance resistance training at a \nhigh intensity and volume with other fitness goals. So, don’t worry that \nyou will reach a state of overtraining all of a sudden; rather, you’ll see \nsigns of it coming in advance.\nWith the case of overreaching, the fatigue is manageable with the \nplanned variations in stress that come from your periodized approach. \nThis may be a short period where volume and/or intensity is reduced; \nhowever, with overtraining the fatigue has become unmanageable \nand a considerably longer recovery period is needed [16]. Functional \noverreaching is desired (and can be seen as an inevitable consequence \nof any program that supplies adequate overload for trained lifters), but \nnonfunctional overreaching and overtraining need to be avoided.\nThis is an important concept, so I’ll explain it once again with some \ngraphs just so that it sticks. Before that though, I need to quickly explain \nthe often misunderstood concepts of ‘deloading’ and ‘tapering.’\nDeloading or Tapering means to reduce training volume in order to let \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n56\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nfatigue go down and express your full potential (fitness) in the form of \nperformance. Tapering normally refers to when this approach is used \nprior to a competition. This is a strategy not only used by strength athletes \nsuch as powerlifters and weightlifters, but also by athletes in sports such \nas triathlon, track and field, and endurance events that have a single-\nday competition. The process involves timing your best condition for \nthe competition day, called ‘peaking’, and tapering is an important part \nof that process. We’ll come back to the specifics of tapering in Level 3: \nProgression, but for now, just think of tapering as a purposeful reduction \nin volume to let residual fatigue subside for competition.\nDeloading is simply when this process is utilized outside of competition \nwithin a training phase. Fatigue dissipates at a faster rate than fitness, \nwhich is why deloads can be such useful tools. It’s important to note that \nevery periodization model ever designed, and every logical approach to \ntraining for any sport includes purposeful periods (be they days, weeks \nor training blocks), where training stress is purposely low. This is not only \nto allow for recovery and fatigue dissipation, but also to prompt better \ngains in the subsequent training to come. This is an important concept, \nbecause many overzealous trainees focus only on the recovery aspect, \nconvincing themselves that they don’t need a deload (you can always \nconvince yourself you can push through more), forgetting that these \nperiods are not only in place to dissipate fatigue but also to prepare \nthem for the training to come and make it more effective.\nAll good? Excellent, let’s delve into those graphs.\nTHE FITNESS-FATIGUE MODEL — CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE DUE \nTO ‘FUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING’ IN A TRAINING CYCLE\nFitness\nPerformance\nFatigue\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n57\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe left half of the graph represents a level of volume with normal \ntraining adaptations. That is to say that fatigue is maintained within a \ncertain range (represented by the horizontal red line) and fitness and \nperformance go up continuously over time.\n1.\t\nAt a certain point, training volume is increased—the trainee is\nattempting to push the envelope and increase their rate of progress, \nwhich causes fitness and fatigue to go up sharply. Performance\nstarts to decrease because the residual fatigue is outpacing the\nincreases in fitness.\n2.\t\nThe trainee notices the decrease in performance; however, they\nare either stubborn and don’t want to decrease volume, or they\nare aware that a period of functional overreaching can help push\nthem to new levels of fitness over the longer term, so they decide\nto not taper volume at this time.\n3.\t\nAt the point of the grey dotted line, the trainee guesses that any\nfurther continuation of the current level of training volume will be\nharmful to long-term progress. Either grudgingly or strategically,\ntraining volume is tapered to let fatigue dissipate before fitness\nlevels are affected.\n4.\t Fitness levels are maintained with the reduced volume, residual\nfatigue dissipates, performance reaches a new level, PRs are had,\nand there is much rejoicing.\nTHE FITNESS-FATIGUE MODEL—CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE \nDUE TO ‘NONFUNCTIONAL OVERREACHING,’ LEADING TO \nOVERTRAINING IN A TRAINING CYCLE\nFitness\nPerformance\nFatigue\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n58\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n1.\t\nUp until the first dotted line we have the same scenario as in the\noverreaching explanation.\n2.\t\nHowever, in this case, the trainee decides to not decrease volume.\nThis isn’t too uncommon—the trainee sees that their performance\nhas been decreasing but they put it down to a bad run of training\nsessions, or maybe they actually take those posters seriously that\nsay, “Pain is weakness leaving the body,” decide that the issue\nis that they haven’t been doing enough volume, and they make\nanother increase.\n3.\t\nThe increasing fatigue causes a faster drop in performance. It\nis not possible to train in a manner that is sufficient to sustain\ntraining adaptations, and fitness goes down.\n4.\t The trainee realizes their mistake and tapers training volume\nconsiderably at the point of the second dotted line. But, it takes a\nconsiderable time before fatigue dissipates, performance comes\nback, and training can be resumed to a level that will start to\nimprove fitness.\nIn reality, most people will naturally stop before they corner themselves \nto such an extent due to the psychological and/or physical discomfort. \nWhen not planned for, and when this occurs due to stubbornness and \nan overzealous attitude, typically this just results in ‘nonfunctional \noverreaching’. The person returns to a normal level of fitness (assuming \nthey weren’t injured) in a week or two, but in the end, made no progress. \nThis “wheel spinning” is very common, while true overtraining is rare \nin strength and physique athletes. But nonetheless, it’s important to \nbe aware that when we train hard and performance doesn’t seem to \nimprove, if we push ourselves even harder, it can backfire.\nIncrease Volume as Your Fitness Improves\nSo, too much volume is counterproductive as it accumulates too \nmuch fatigue. But it is also true that for the most part, strength and \nhypertrophy gains increase with more volume.\nWhen you have been training for a while and have made good strength \nand mass gains, but have plateaued with your current training, in order \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n59\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nto make more progress you may need to increase volume. You will \nnot necessarily want to add volume each training day, week, or even \nmonth, but increasing volume gradually over your training career as \nnecessary, may be needed for progression [20].\nA good way to think about volume over your career is to do enough \nvolume to progress and only to increase it when progress has plateaued \n(assuming you are recovering normally). This is a much smarter choice \nthan constantly putting yourself in the hole with fatigue by adding \nvolume prematurely and having to drop volume back and taper all the \ntime. Also remember, that if you are lifting heavier loads, even if reps \nand sets are the same, that is an indication that progressive overload \nhas occurred and you are adapting.\nRemember, this is long-term stuff. Our coaching service is called “3D \nMuscle Journey”, not “3D Muscle Tomorrow”. It’s going to take time, it’s \ngoing to take commitment and it’s going to take adherence. In order to \ndo that, you must be able to manage your fatigue.\nAn Aside: Balance Volume, Life, and Fatigue to Ensure Adherence \nand Sustainability\nWhen we increase volume, it can cause more fatigue. However, as we \nmentioned in the previous chapter discussing adherence, our bodies \nare exposed to many different types of stress that affect performance \n[19], not only training.\nGiven that, to ensure maximum sustainability it may be best to consider \nan amount of volume that leaves some reserve in our tank rather than \nreally pushing the limit every day. Serious athletes may need to take \nthings closer to the edge to get the best results possible, but also \nremember that for a competitive athlete the consequences of reaching \na state of overtraining are larger. There’s no one size fits all answer \nlike “everyone will be happy with 5 sets regardless” and you will need \nto take many different factors into account. As mentioned earlier, use \ncritical thinking, be careful not to be black and white, but it’s not a bad \nidea to be conservative and allow a bit of a buffer when choosing how \nmuch training stress to pile on.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n60\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nVolume Recommendations\n“Do enough to progress, not as much as possible. Increase when \nplateaued if you are recovering well.”\nI can’t tell you how often trainees try to justify to themselves doing \nmore, and more, and more, when in fact they don’t need to. Some of \nyou may feel like I’m hammering this point home over and over and \nbeating a dead horse, but indulge me. Invariably, some of you will latch \nonto the statements I’ve made at certain points in this text such as \n“strength and hypertrophy gains increase with volume” and ignore that \nI’ve also said you can do too much and that in fact doing too much can \nbe counterproductive.\nTo help you avoid this mistake, I want to appeal to your intellect by \npointing out a couple of key studies that should curb your appetite to \nbuy into the “more is always better” attitude that is so pervasive in the \nbodybuilding community.\nThe first is a study that was done by Gonzalez-Badillo and colleagues in \n2005 [12]. This study looked at young, healthy, well-trained competitive \nmale weightlifters performing three levels of volume on the back squat, \nsnatch, clean and jerk, and accessory lifts for 10 weeks. One group \nperformed 1923 repetitions over this period, one group performed \n2481 repetitions, and the last group performed 3030 repetitions. All \ngroups progressed in strength; however, the moderate volume group \nperforming 2481 repetitions progressed the most.\nFor those interested in hypertrophy and not strength, consider a study \ndone by Heaselgrave and colleagues in 2018 [13]. In it, three groups of \ntrained males performed either 9, 18, or 27 total sets consisting of curls, \nrows and pulldowns to try to establish the dose-response relationship \nbetween volume and biceps growth. While significant growth from \nbaseline occurred in all groups, the moderate volume group performing \n18 sets per week in total had meaningfully greater increases in their \nbiceps muscle thickness than the low or high volume groups. Again, \nhypertrophy still occurred in the groups performing a higher or lower \nnumber of sets, but like strength in the Gonzalez-Badillo study, there \nwas a “sweet spot”.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n61\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nToo much volume can have negative impacts on both hypertrophy and \nstrength. Doing the most volume you can do while still progressing is \nnot what is optimal for either hypertrophy or strength. That said, neither \nis doing the absolute minimum you can do while still progressing. \nHowever, the latter is a more sustainable approach as you can always \nadd more volume when you plateau, and you are less likely to be injured. \nBut of course, doing too little or too much is still not ideal. There needs \nto be balance, and at the end of this section I will be giving you some \npractical recommendations on where might be a good idea to start in \nterms of volume.\nNow before you get too hung up on specific numbers of sets per muscle \ngroup, remember that exercises will overlap in terms of what muscle \ngroups they work. Also, heavy enough warm-up sets will contribute \nto your volume, and it’s difficult to determine at what point these sets \n“count”. Also, remember that volume, frequency and intensity are all \ninterrelated and affect one another. Increasing intensity impacts how \nmuch volume you can handle even if you keep sets and reps static. \nIncreasing frequency while keeping load, sets and reps static increases \nyour weekly volume a great deal. So what that means, is that the volume \nranges below are guidelines at best, not commandments, rules, or the \nrange that everyone “should” fall into.\nLastly, remember the Fitness-Fatigue Model when you are in a state \nof higher than normal fatigue and/or lower than normal recuperative \nabilities, the amount of volume that will be optimal will be less. This is \nbecause you will generate fatigue from outside of the gym, and fatigue \nwill dissipate at a slower rate. That means whether you’re dieting or \ngaining affects the optimal volume, as well as other things like life stress, \ntravel, illness, etc. But, you should be able to find the right volume for \nyourself if you start within the range suggested in the table below and \nadjust from there according to your response.\nPut this all together and here is our summary of recommendations for \ntraining volume. The summary is based on the combined data of two \nmeta-analyses (again, studies of all the studies on a given topic; the \nhighest quality of scientific evidence) published in 2017 on the number of \nsets performed per week on a given movement that maximize strength \n[7] and hypertrophy [8]. Both meta-analyses reach a similar conclusion\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n62\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthat 5–12+ and 10+ sets are optimal, on average, for increasing strength \nand hypertrophy, respectively.\nBut what is with that plus sign, and what about all my talk of doing \ntoo much? Well, unfortunately we don’t have enough research to \nmeta-analyze the limits of volume (yet), but we do have some studies \nshowing that going past the ~20 set mark can sometimes be too much \n[13–15], which matches our experience with coaching thousands of \n3DMJ clients, which gives us a good starting range for weekly volume.\nOn balance, there are two studies showing even higher volumes can \nbe beneficial (30+ sets), but one was on well-trained individuals (~4 \nyears training experience and ~200 lb bench press on average) [21] \nand the other was on young, fit, navy men confined to a ship with little \noutside stress and consistent nutrition and sleep schedules [22]. Thus, \nthe smartest approach is to start with the recommended volume, only \nincreasing past it if everything else is optimal (sleep, nutrition, life stress \nbalance, technique, intensity, frequency etc) and only if it is absolutely \nnecessary to break a plateau. Lastly, your training frequency and \nintensity will definitely affect how much volume might be appropriate, \nso before you change your training based on these recommendations, \nfinish the rest of this chapter:\nVolume\n10–20 sets per muscle group/\nmovement per week\nconsider overlap and \nheavy warm-up sets\nINTENSITY\nIntensity is an important, often misunderstood variable. Many describe \nintensity based on subjective feelings of soreness, or how “hardcore” a \nworkout was. However, intensity from an objective standpoint refers to \neither the ‘intensity of load’ or the ‘intensity of effort’; how much you \nare lifting (often defined as a ‘rep max’ [RM] or percentage of a one-\nrep max [1RM]) or how near to your maximal effort that load is (often \ndefined as a rating of perceived exertion [RPE] score), respectively. \nThere are a number of ways to describe intensity, in absolute terms, \nand in relative terms which will be discussed, but we’ll also discuss how \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n63\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nintensity fits into the big picture, rather than examining intensity as just \na single factor. A large part of what dictates what load we decide to \nuse depends on whether our goal is strength or hypertrophy.\nSpecificity\nThe first thing we need to think about is a concept in strength training \ncalled ‘The Principle of Specificity’ (also known as the SAID principle; \nSpecific Adaptations to Imposed Demands) which we briefly touched \non in the previous section. Recall, to get a certain outcome, we need \nto train for it. This principle is important when deciding intensity, \nspecifically when discussing training for either strength or hypertrophy.\nMeasuring Intensity\nThere are a few ways to measure the intensity of effort and load.\n1. Percentage of 1RM\nA very common way to measure the intensity of load is the percentage \nof one-rep max (1RM). This can be calculated based on an estimated \n1RM from performing an AMRAP set (as many reps as possible), or it \ncan be based on an actual 1RM test. We then prescribe loads based on \na percentage. For example, 5 reps with 80% of 1RM.\nThe downsides to this system are that it’s not appropriate to do a \n1RM on all movements — a bicep curl for example or a lateral raise. \nAdditionally, depending on the person (and especially at percentages \nof 1RM below 90%), one person may be able to do a very different \nnumber of repetitions at a similar percentage of 1RM compared to \nanother [23]. In fact in one study, among a group of resistance-trained \nmales, there was a spread of 9 to 26 repetitions completed when \nperforming an AMRAP with 70% 1RM on a back squat [29]. Thus, unless \nyou know what your specific capabilities are, you can run into issues \nusing this approach. Despite this limitation, it’s still useful to know what \nmost trained lifters can do on average at a given percentage of 1RM \nfor programming. Thus, the following table can be viewed as a useful, \nalbeit non-individual, guideline:\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n64\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nPercentage Of 1RM\nRepetitions Allowed\n100\n1\n95\n2\n90\n3-4\n85\n5-6\n80\n7-8\n75\n9-10\n70\n11-12\n2. A Rep Max (RM)\nVery simply, this is load prescription using your previously tested max \nfor a given number of reps. This is a little more useful for a bodybuilder. \nFor example, while folks have differing abilities to perform repetitions \nat the same percentage of 1RM (e.g. you might be able to do 15 reps at \n70% of your 1RM, I might only be able to do 10 reps) a 6RM is a 6RM. \nAt worst, as you get stronger in a program your 6RM will become your \n7, 8, 9 and eventually perhaps your 10RM. But, this still keeps you much \ncloser to the target intensity of effort than a percentage of 1RM which \nhas large inter-individual variability.\n3. RPE (Specifically Based on Repetitions Remaining)\nA relatively popular way of measuring the intensity of effort is using an \nRPE (rating of perceived exertion) scale based on repetitions in reserve \n(RIR). This was popularized and developed for powerlifting-specific \nresistance training by IPF champion and powerlifting coach and author, \nMike Tuchscherer. Since 2014, I have researched this with Dr. Michael \nZourdos and our colleagues at his muscle physiology lab at the Florida \nAtlantic University and at the Sports Performance Research Institute \nNew Zealand here at the Auckland University of Technology [24].\nEssentially, RPE when using this scale is based on how close to failure you \nget at the conclusion of each set. You simply do your sets and choose how \nclose to failure you wish to get. A 10 RPE would be at failure (or rather, \nno additional load or reps could have been performed), a 9 RPE would \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n65\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nbe one rep left, an 8 RPE would be two. If it’s easier to conceptualize, \nyou can also just think about RIR, and simply state whether you finished \na set with 1, 2, or 3 RIR, etc. Experienced lifters are very accurate when \nestimating RIR, if you aren’t an experienced lifter, or if you are but you \ntend to struggle with estimating RIR, try the following:\n1.\t\nRecord a video of your sets and rate the RPE after watching the\nreplay.\n2.\t\nTry a short block (3–6 weeks) of low volume training where you\ngo to concentric failure frequently (get spotters or a workout\npartner) to really see where your limits are.\n3.\t\nRate your RPE in your head, then ask your (preferably experienced)\ntraining partner what they thought the RPE was.\n4.\t Hire a coach who uses RPE, and ask for feedback on your lifting\nvideos.\n5.\t Do a set for as many reps as it takes to reach a target RPE, then\nwhen you think you’ve reached it, go to failure and see if you were\naccurate (e.g. grab a weight you think you can do for 8–12 reps, do\nreps until you hit an RPE 8, then keep going). If you can do more or\nless than the RIR you expected, you know you need more practice.\nThe table below outlines the scale:\nRPE Scale Based On Repetitions In Reserve\n10\nCould not do more reps or load\n9.5\nCould not do more reps, could do slightly more load\n9\nCould do 1 more repetition\n8.5\nCould definitely do 1 more repetition, chance at 2\n8\nCould do 2 more repetitions\n7.5\nCould definitely do 2 more repetitions, chance at 3\n7\nCould do 3 more repetitions\n5-6\nCould do 4 to 6 more repetitions\n1-4\nVery light to light effort\nYou can use RPE alongside % 1RM, or RM to help give someone a place \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n66\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nto start, and then a guideline on how to adjust. This approach fixes the \nissue of some lifters being able to do only 9 reps at 70% of 1RM, while \nothers can do over 20 [29].\nFor example, if you just prescribed 3x8x70% there are lifters out there \nwho would be at a 9 RPE on set 1, hit a 10 RPE on set two, and only get \n6 or 7 reps on their third set, unable to complete your prescription.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there are lifters who would be at \na 3–4 RPE on all three sets, barely feeling like they did anything, who \nwouldn’t get the intended stimulus. \nHowever in both cases, if you prescribed 3x8x70% @ 6–8 RPE, only \nthe first set would be off target because they can adjust. In the case of \nthe lifter “bad at reps” who recorded a 9 RPE on set one, they should \nreduce their load on the next set to put them between a 6–8 RPE. In \nthe case of the lifter “good at reps”, they should increase it.\n4. Failure\nWhile not technically a measure of intensity like the above methods, \nenough people train to failure almost exclusively that it is worth \ndiscussing in this section. \n‘Failure’ has two common meanings: where there is a break down in form \nduring a rep but maybe an additional repetition could be performed \nwith poor form (technical failure), and where the weight can no longer \nbe physically moved (muscular failure). \nIn general, we don’t want to perform the big, multi-joint compound lifts \nto muscular failure (squat variations, deadlift, overhead press, etc) as \nthe risk of injury is too high. Imagine you’re squatting heavy to the point \nwhere you fail in the middle of a rep and are stuck half-way, without \na spotter. It’s very tough to lower the weight again from this position \nwith good form, and the chances you break yo’self are high. \nEven performing these lifts to technical failure on a regular basis is a bad \nidea for the same reasons and because the systemic fatigue generated \nis also very high (which can limit your ability to perform for the rest \nof the session and delay recovery for subsequent sessions) [24, 25]. \nThat said, it is much safer to train to failure (both types) with isolation \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n67\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nexercises that don’t require full body efforts such as bicep curls, leg \nextensions, or even some machine compound movements like rows, \npulldowns, or perhaps the leg press.\nYou may be thinking at this point, “Why would I ever not want to go \nto failure? Doesn’t failure increase the amount of muscle activation I \nget and ensure that I have trained the fiber completely?” Those things \nare true for the most part; however, that’s looking at each exercise in \nisolation, rather than the big picture.\nIf you were to do 3 sets of bench with your 8RM load, and on your \nfirst set you maxed out and went to failure getting 8 reps, you would \nprobably drop down to 6 on your second set, and then possibly 5 reps \non your third. This will be 19 reps total.\nHowever, if you were to stop and just do 7 reps on the first set, you may \nbe able to maintain 7 reps for the next two sets as well. This will be 21 \nreps total.\nIn this way, it’s easy to see that we can hurt the amount of volume \nthat we can do by going to failure too frequently. Thinking even \nbigger picture, going past just the single exercise and thinking about \nsubsequent training sessions, there are further negative implications \nfrom training to failure all the time. One study had two groups doing the \nsame training in all aspects except the one group went to failure, while \nthe other did not. At the end of the study, similar progress was made \nby both groups; however, the group training to failure had indications \nof being in an overtrained state [24]. Other research has shown that \neven when using the same load for the same total volume, a group \ngoing to failure took longer to recover their strength than a group not \ngoing to failure [25]. Finally, and probably most convincingly, the most \nup to date meta-analysis we have on training to failure or not found no \nadvantage in terms of strength gains when training to failure [26].\n“So, should we never use failure?” No, it just needs to be done intelligently. \nIt needs to be for a purpose. If it’s 1RM testing or for an AMRAP, it has a clear \npurpose. Also, going to failure on a squat or a lateral raise are very different \nthings. You can probably go to failure on your isolation movements after \nyour compound lifts and get some extra stimulation with little to no cost \nto overall recovery. Or, if you know that you are training a muscle group \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n68\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwith three different exercises you can take that last exercise’s last set to \nfailure, just to get a little more out of your training.\nThe point is that there needs to be a logical reason behind the use of \ntaking sets to failure in your training, and it needs to fit in with your \ntraining progression. If we have an intended light week, or what people \ncall a deload (or taper) in our periodization, we probably don’t want to \ntrain to failure at all just to ensure that this week does its job of allowing \nfor enough recovery before moving on to the next training block.\n— Failure needs to be used with a purpose if used at all.\nIntensity Considerations for Strength\nThere are three major factors that optimize strength [2]:\n1. Muscle Mass (and Other Structural Adaptations)\nA larger cross-sectional area and more mass means we have more muscle \nfibers to contract and we can move heavier loads. More muscle mass \ntypically means more strength relative to when you had less muscle \nmass. There are also other structural changes including adaptations to \nthe non-contractile elements of muscle (titin, the extracellular matrix, \ncostameres, etc.), connective tissue (tendon, fascia and ligaments), \nmyofibril packing density (how many contractile units are in each \nmuscle fiber), and changes in pennation angle (the attachment angle \nof muscle fibers in orientation to the tendon), that can affect strength.\n2. Neuromuscular Adaptations\nIt is the neurological system that recruits and activates our muscles and \nallows us to express strength. Neuromuscular adaptations to heavier \nloading allow contractions to be more forceful and efficient. This means \nthat we can use more of the full potential of our existing muscle mass.\n3. Motor Patterns / Skill\nStrength is not just a quality of the body but also a skill, meaning that \nyou need to get better at the movement that you want to be stronger at. \nSpecificity relates to the velocity, load, joint angles and the recruitment \npatterns that you need to use to move external loads. How strong you \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n69\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ncan be in the squat, for example, is affected by how familiar you are \nwith the movement.\nTo optimize strength, you have to train in a specific way to develop all \nthree of these qualities.\nOn the other hand, hypertrophy does not require the same degree of \nspecificity in terms of loading. Muscle can grow quite well with both \nmoderate and heavy loading, which was shown in a study by Schoenfeld \n[5]. He took two groups performing similar amounts of weekly volume \nso as to isolate the effect of intensity. One group did all of their training \nwith three rep maxes, the other group did all their training with ten rep \nmaxes, but total volume load was not statistically different between \ngroups as the heavy load group did more sets to compensate for the \nlower number of reps. Interestingly enough, there was an equal amount \nof muscle growth in both groups. However, holding true to the principle \nof specificity, the three rep max group got stronger than the ten rep \nmax group.\nUnsurprisingly, this means that if you want to get good at lifting heavy \nthings, you have to lift heavy things. However, muscle growth is not \na specific adaptation like muscular endurance, speed or strength. \nRemember, the purpose of the human body is survival, so the adaptations \nit makes in response to a stress are always related back to being able \nto better handle that stress. Being stronger, having more endurance, \ngetting faster, you can logically see how these qualities directly aid \nsurvival. But improved aesthetic appeal and increased muscle size don’t \nfit the bill. Rather, hypertrophy is an effect of training with adequate \nvolume at a high enough effort.\nExtreme Specificity\nSome of you reading the above may find yourself thinking, “Okay, so if \nI’m a strength athlete, and my goal is to increase my 1RM on ‘x’ lift, and \nif specificity is the key, then why shouldn’t I just train by doing a 1RM, \non that lift, every time I step in the gym?”\nWell, you wouldn’t be the first to ask that question, and in fact, there \nare entire weight training systems built on that exact premise. The \nBulgarian weightlifting method specifically used a high frequency, high-\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n70\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nintensity, low-volume per session, daily 1RM approach where almost \nevery training session began with a conservative max attempt on a lift, \nfollowed by some volume work. This approach was actually shown to \nbe effective in a case study of three well-trained strength athletes who \nsquatted to a max, every day, and who all got stronger following this \napproach [27].\nHowever, the question does come down to, “Is it optimal?” Surely, we \nknow that it can work and the upsides to this approach are directly \nrelated to how specific this approach is. Logically, it should result in \nmore consistency in max effort attempts, increased mental toughness \nwhen it comes to max attempts, better ability to recover from high-\nintensity lifting, and theoretically increased 1RM strength.\nThat said, we can’t forget the other not so positive implications of \nperforming a 1RM on a regular basis. High-intensity approaches \nnecessitate lower volumes per session due to the time and energy cost \nof using such a high intensity. The ‘volume load’ and number of reps \nperformed in an hour using this approach pales in comparison to an \napproach using higher repetitions and moderate loads. This is part of \nthe reason why the frequency is also so high in the Bulgarian system, \nto offset the low volume per session.\nAlso, higher intensity means higher fatigue. As will be discussed later, \nregular training to failure (performing the greatest number of repetitions \nyou can at a given load, e.g. a rep max like a 1RM) can result in a state \nindicative of overtraining [28], increases the time course of recovery \n[29] and performing the same volume of training but using heavier\nloading, may result in more joint pain and injury [5]. Additionally, many\npeople struggle to hold form at very high loads, and since strength is\na skill, not just an attribute of the body, you must consider that if you\nstruggle with form at maximal loads, you may not be ingraining the\nbest motor patterns.\nMost importantly, doing more and more of your volume at as high of an \nintensity as possible might not actually result in superior strength gains. \nMuch like the study that was done by Gonzalez-Badillo on three volume \nranges, Gonzalez-Badillo also performed a study on intensity. In this \nstudy, they once again examined young, healthy, well-trained competitive \nmale weightlifters performing the back squat, snatch, clean and jerk, and \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n71\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\naccessory lifts for 10 weeks. This time, the three groups performed the \nsame total repetitions over this period; however, each group performed \na different proportion of their reps in the 90–100% of the 1RM zone. One \ngroup performed 46, another 93, and the final group 184 of their total \nrepetitions in the 90–100% of the 1RM loading zone. Interestingly enough, \nthe middle group increased their strength the most [30].\nThe take-home message is that while an extremely specific, high-\nfrequency, high-load approach can work and will likely make you \nstronger, it may not make you stronger than a more moderate approach \nfor the reasons listed above. For it to be a feasible and maybe even \nan optimal approach in some cases, it likely should not be performed \nfor extended periods, and might only be appropriate for overreaching \nblocks or in an intensification phase of competition preparation.\nIntensity Considerations for Hypertrophy\nFor hypertrophy, the absolute load on the bar is much less important \nthan it is for strength. However, ‘intensity of effort’ is critical, as is \nmaking sure that your loads increase over time across the spectrum of \nrep ranges you use in training.\nHow Light is Too Light?\nA wider loading range can be effective for hypertrophy than for strength, \nbut load is still important. The cardinal rule of progressive overload still \napplies if your goal is muscle growth, meaning we need to lift weights \nthat actually provide an overload.\nIf you think about it, we’re all under load all the time because we are \non earth, which means that our muscles need to resist gravity in order \nfor us to move around. If the magnitude of that load wasn’t important \nfor hypertrophy at all, we would all be as big as our genetics would \nallow a few years after puberty, just from being on planet earth and \nconstantly experiencing ‘time under tension’. So clearly, tension must \nbe progressed for hypertrophy to continue.\nTwo aspects of intensity are important for hypertrophy, ‘intensity of \neffort’ (how close you are to failure), and to a lesser degree ‘intensity \nof load’, how heavy or light the loads you train with are.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n72\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIssues with Both Low and High-Intensity Training\nIt’s been repeatedly shown, and demonstrated via a 2017 meta-analysis \n[31], that both high (>60% 1RM) and low (<60% 1RM) loads can cause \ncomparable hypertrophy if the volume is similar, and effort is high. However, \nthere is a bottom range of intensity of load that is too light to be optimal.\nLasevicius and colleagues demonstrated that even when doing a similar \nnumber sets to failure, 20% of 1RM produced less hypertrophy than \nsets in the 40–80% 1RM range [32]. Thus, it seems that very low-load, \nhigh-rep sets (40+ rep sets) produce too much global fatigue before \nresulting in adequate local muscular stimulus, or are so high-repetition \nthat they are more similar to endurance than resistance training to be \neffective for hypertrophy. So, that means that you can certainly train in \nthe ~15–35RM range, and if you perform a similar number of sets, you’d \nprogress similarly to someone training in the more traditional 6–15RM \nrange. However, there are also practical concerns for high repetition \ntraining even in less extreme (15–35RM) examples.\nIn a study by Schoenfeld [1], a group doing 3x25–35RM achieved similar \nhypertrophy in comparison to a group doing 3x8–12RM. However, \naccording to Dr. Schoenfeld, a significant portion of the participants in \nhis study in the higher-rep group experienced a great deal of discomfort. \nVomiting during training was a common occurrence. \nThis is important to consider because if you are to use high-repetition \nsets, to ensure you are activating and training enough fibers, you have \nto get through the initial ‘junk volume’ and eventually reach an adequate \nproximity to failure. On certain movements like deadlifts, squats, lunges, \npresses, and free-weight rows, the global fatigue is so high that this is \nsimply not worth it, as it can degrade your performance on subsequent \nsets and exercises. Also, higher rep sets near to failure take longer to \nrecover from in subsequent days compared to lower-rep sets [25]. \nAdditionally, in a study, you have a team of researchers pushing you to \nactually reach failure. In the real world, because of this global fatigue, \nyour ability to tell when you are truly approaching failure gets worse \nthe more repetitions in a set you do [33].\nTo sum up high-repetition, light-load training, growth can certainly \nbe achieved training at ~30%–60% of 1RM (~20–35RM); however, it \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n73\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ncomes at a cost, and for logistical reasons may not be as efficient as \nmoderate or heavy-load training. Does that mean you should never do \nany training lighter than 12RM? No, not at all. The fatigue from doing \nhigh-rep compound movements is a problem, but lateral raises, curls, \nmachine work, and other isolation exercises don’t generate the same \nlevel of global fatigue. Also, if you get joint pain on certain movements, \nlow-load, higher-rep training is an excellent tool. Finally, in theory, \nincluding some high repetition training (in the 15–20RM range) may \nbe more effective for overall growth as it could theoretically be more \neffective for training slow fatiguing muscle fibers [5]. That said, this \nhasn’t yet been adequately researched.\nAdditionally, the issues I’ve presented with low-load, high-rep training \ndoesn’t mean you should do a 180-degree turn and solely rely on heavy \ntraining either.\nAs I previously mentioned, Schoenfeld also did a study comparing \nmatched volumes of 3RM to 10RM loads and found equal muscle \ngrowth, but greater strength in the 3RM group [5]. Slam dunk for the \n3RM group right? Not necessarily. \n}\n} First, if your only consideration is hypertrophy, your absolute strength \nisn’t a concern (you could make an argument that for long-term \nprogressive overload, strength gains are important, but I would put \nforth that both groups got stronger, and getting stronger, not how \nmuch stronger you got, is what is key to continued growth). \n}\n} Second, the 10RM group was able to finish their training in a \nfraction of the time it took the 3RM group to finish. The 10RM group \nreported they felt capable of doing much more volume had they \nbeen allowed. \n}\n} Third, the 3RM group experienced more joint pain, had more \ndropouts due to injury than the 10RM group, and regularly felt beat \nup and tired. \nSo as you can see, from a practical standpoint, there are issues with \nusing only heavy or light loading exclusively for hypertrophy. For light \nloading, especially with compound lifts, it forces you to generate a lot \nof acute fatigue, turning each session into a potential puke party and \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n74\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nalso can extend your recovery time needed between sessions. When \nonly using heavy loads, the time cost of each session is much higher, \nthe strain to joints and soft tissue is higher, and the overall fatigue \ngenerated per repetition is higher, limiting the total amount of volume \nyou can handle.\nIntensity Recommendations\nIntensity is specific to your goal. Lift heavy for strength, and ensure \nsets are performed at an adequate effort for size. Remember \nprogressive overload.\nFor Hypertrophy\nIf hypertrophy is the goal, the weight just needs to be heavy enough \n(above ~30% 1RM) and sets need to be adequately challenging (5+ \nRPE). It is often said that the 6–12 rep range is the ideal rep range for \nhypertrophy but in fact, there’s nothing magical about this range. It’s \njust a convenient range to accumulate volume.\nLower intensity work (12–30 rep range) will also induce hypertrophy \nalthough it can be quite fatiguing on compound lifts and may prolong \nrecovery if near to failure. However, it can still be beneficial when \nconnective tissue health is a problem on certain exercises, and there is \na theoretical rationale to train in a spectrum of rep ranges.\nLikewise, while it shouldn’t be a focus, it’s important to not forget the \nusefulness of high intensity (1–5 rep range) strength work even if the \nmain goal is hypertrophy. Getting stronger is important for progressive \noverload. When you’re stronger, you can use heavier weights which \nallows you to do more volume more easily, so it is a good idea to include \nsome heavy work as well.\nPut this all together and here are practical recommendations for \nintensity for hypertrophy:\nPerform ⅔ – ¾ of your volume in the 6–12 rep range at a 5–10 RPE, \nand the other ¼ – ⅓ in the lower-rep, higher-intensity (1–6 reps at a \n5–10 RPE) and higher-rep, lower-intensity ranges (12–20 reps at a \n5–10 RPE).\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n75\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nFor Strength\nIf strength is the goal, specificity is needed so a considerably larger \nproportion of your volume needs to be performed with heavier loads.\nSo, for strength, does that mean that all your volume should be as \nheavy as possible? No.\nMuscle can move weight when it’s bigger, so you need enough volume \nto grow, so you shouldn't only use singles, doubles or triples in training.\nRemember what Schoenfeld found comparing 3RMs with 10RMs, that \nthe 3RM group not only took four times as long to complete their \nworkouts (because they had to rest longer), but also experienced more \njoint pain, had more dropouts, and verbalized more mental burnout.\nRemember also from Gonzalez-Badillo, the group that increased their \nstrength the most had a moderate proportion of their volume from \n90% 1RM+ loads, not the group that did the highest proportion of their \nwork at 90%+. While volume is a stimulus for strength, its contribution \nis smaller than intensity, meaning that the exposure itself to heavy \nloads is more important for building the skill of strength than how \nmuch exposure you get. For example, there is data showing that the \ntop intensity in a series of sets likely has a greater impact on changes \nin strength than the average intensity across sets [34]. Very high load \ntraining at a high volume comes at the cost of mental fatigue, and joint \npain, and if used exclusively it’s an inefficient and unnecessarily taxing \nway to accumulate practice.\nThus, there are advantages to mixing in some light and moderate loads \nto achieve the same volume for the sake of time efficiency, joint stress \nand ability to recover.\nPut this all together and here are practical recommendations for \nintensity for strength:\nPerform ⅔ – ¾ of your volume in the 1–6 rep range at a 5–10 RPE, \nand the other ¼ – ⅓ in the higher rep moderate intensity ranges (6–\n15 reps at a 5–10 RPE).\nThe following intensity recommendations represent the average values \nfor those training for either strength or hypertrophy. In the next level of \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n76\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe Pyramid, we’ll discuss how these recommendations fluctuate over \nthe course of a periodized plan.\nIntensity\nStrength\n⅔–¾ of volume in the 1–6 rep range, \nremaining volume in the 6–15 rep range, \nat a 5–10 RPE\nHypertrophy\n⅔–¾ of volume in the 6–12 rep range, \nremaining volume in the 1–6 and 12–20 rep \nrange, at a 5–10 RPE\nFREQUENCY\nFrequency is what organizes volume and intensity. It is about how you \nspread the training stress you need across the training week. Some \npeople discuss frequency as if it’s a stimulus in and of itself, but even \nthough higher frequency training can be beneficial independent \nof volume or intensity, this is caused by optimizing training stress. \nManipulating frequency is the way you organize your training to improve \nthe relationship between stress and recovery so that no single session \nbecomes overly taxing.\nAll work in one session is not equal to all work split across 6 sessions.\nHow Frequency Impacts Training\nThere are several aspects that we need to consider. Learning, recovery, \nand organization.\nLearning Through Practice\nThink of the extreme example where you try to cram all of your volume \ninto one weekly session. Think of when you were a student. You may \nhave done a lot of cramming, memorizing huge volumes of information \nin one day, the night right before a test. I’m guessing you usually did \nok in the test, but didn’t remember much of what you studied a week \nlater, am I right?\nThere’s a limit to the amount of effective study you can actually do in a \nsingle session, sometimes you just have to give the brain a break and wait \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n77\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nuntil it is ready for more. It might be useful to think of training this way too.\nIf you try to cram all of your training volume into the one day, you’re not \ngoing to learn the movements as well, because the quality of movement \ndegrades as the session drags on and you get more fatigued mentally \nand physically. The stimulus you are able to generate degrades as \nthe session continues, potentially inhibiting the efficiency of strength \ndevelopment or hypertrophy.\nAt the other extreme, if you have six sets to do per week, and only \ndo one set per day, you wouldn’t really have much chance to identify \nmistakes and correct them on a day to day basis. If you do your one \ntop set poorly, you don’t have a second or third set to correct it. Even if \nyou perform perfectly, you don’t have a chance to repeat it and ingrain \nit until at least a day later.\nRecovery\nIt’s important to remember that we’re not practicing drawing here, \nwe’re practicing heavy strength training. Our bodies are going to \ntake a beating when we are training heavy and hard all the time. Even \ndoing the same amount of volume, just by spreading it apart into more \nmanageable blocks across the week, getting in sleep, proper nutrition, \nand just living life between sessions, may result in better growth.\nThis isn’t just theory, there is a large body of evidence to suggest that we \ncan do too much in a single session. In fact, studies have shown superior…\n}\n} neuromuscular adaptations [35, 36]\n}\n} hormonal markers for recovery [35, 37]\n}\n} strength improvement [35-39]\n}\n} and gains in lean body mass [36, 39]\nin groups that split their volume up over more sessions, doing less \nvolume per session, but the same amount in a week.\nYou may very well get to a point where you need to increase volume, \nand your total training volume per week becomes high enough that \nhow you split it up is very important. Doing too much in one session is \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n78\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\na real thing that can happen and it may make sense to spread it out.\nSome of the above-cited studies, while interesting on a theoretical basis, \nare not the most realistic of comparisons. In a few cases, a large amount \nof volume performed in only a single session is compared to three \nweekly sessions, or a single session is compared to two-a-day sessions. \nIn most cases, this is not how the majority of strength and physique \nathletes train (except for some Olympic lifters). However, probably the \nmost convincing studies that look at “real world” examples of both \ntraditional bodybuilding and powerlifting training while manipulating \nfrequency, are studies by Schoenfeld and colleagues [40] and Raastad \nand colleagues [39].\nSchoenfeld specifically compared two, three-day per week training \nprograms in well-trained men with different frequencies per muscle \ngroup. One was a split routine where the lifters trained chest and back \non day one, legs on day two, and shoulders and arms on day 3, while \nthe second group trained full body on every day. The exercises, sets, \nreps, and relative loads were the same across the week in both groups, \nand interestingly enough, significantly greater increases in hypertrophy \nwere observed in the group training full body three days per week [40].\nSimilarly, Raastad and colleagues studied the Norwegian powerlifting \nteam, dividing half the team into a three-day per week powerlifting split, \nand the other half into a six-day per week split where they performed \nhalf as many sets per session (to do the same number per week) and \nused the same average intensity per week. In this case, strength and \nhypertrophy were found to be higher in the group that split their training \ninto more sessions despite equal volume and intensity [39].\nHowever, more important than any single study is the meta-analytic \ndata done in the last few years on the effect of frequency on strength \nand hypertrophy (remember, meta-analyses are studies of all studies \non a given topic, and provide the highest quality scientific data we \nhave available):\n}\n} Schoenfeld et al., found that regardless of volume, training each \nmuscle group at least twice weekly resulted in superior hypertrophy \nto once weekly [41]\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n79\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} Grgic et al., found higher frequencies improve strength by increasing \nvolume, showing how frequency can be used as a tool to organize \ntraining stress [42]\n}\n} Ralston et al., reported similar findings to Grgic except that greater \nupper-body strength was caused by higher frequencies independent \nof volume [43]\n}\n} Similarly, Greg Nuckols showed in an open-access meta-analysis \nthat higher frequencies lead to greater strength when the volume \nwas matched, especially for upper-body pressing [44] \n}\n} Greg also posted an open-access meta-analysis on hypertrophy, \nshowing higher frequencies, independent of volume, resulted in \ngreater hypertrophy [45]\nWe limit ourselves to the amount of volume that we can do in a week by \ntrying to split the work across too few sessions and if we are relatively \nadvanced, we could potentially be making better progress by splitting \nthe high volume we must perform to progress, into more frequent, \nmore manageable sessions.\nFrequency Recommendations\nOrganization matters. It is possible to do too much in a single \nsession. Spread the work over the number of sessions required to \naccommodate volume.\nWhen it comes to designing a program, realize there’s no single perfect \nfrequency. You must find the right approach for your training volume \nand your schedule. Some people may have certain days free, with large \nblocks of time, and they could train for three hours if needed. Others \ncan only train for an hour, tops, but can train six days per week. So you \nhave to organize your volume based on what your schedule allows. \nThat said, most of the time training anywhere from 3–6 sessions is \nappropriate for hypertrophy or strength related goals (twice per week \ncan work quite well for time-pressed novices), and this will determine \nhow frequently you train each muscle group or movement.\n1.\t\nDetermine your volume (considering the number of exercises, sets,\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n80\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nrest periods and warm-ups) for the week that you need in order \nto make progress towards your goal. Then consider how much \ntime it would take to complete it all. Consider what frequency of \ntraining would allow you to break up that training into manageable \nchunks that would allow you to perform it all with a high quality \nof focus, movement, and intention.\n2.\t\nTry out your proposed schedule. If you find that you have too\nmuch volume on any single day to perform well, look to reschedule\nthe volume across your current number of sessions or consider\nadding in another session to your training week.\n3.\t\nLikewise, if you find that you have a day that is completed quickly and\nwith minimal fatigue, consider rescheduling the volume to put more\non this day so that your other training sessions aren’t as fatiguing.\nRemember, that as you progress (get stronger, bigger, and more \nadvanced as a trainee) you will need to perform more volume in order to \nproduce enough stress to keep your body adapting. So, in general, the \nnumber of days that you will need to train will increase as you advance \nto accommodate these volume increases.\nThe following frequency recommendations represent the average \nvalues to be used when training for strength or hypertrophy. However, \nfor some strength athletes at certain points in a periodized plan, it may \nbe appropriate to use a higher frequency on specific lifts, with a lower \nvolume per session to achieve specific outcomes. This will be covered \nin more detail in the next chapter.\nFrequency\n2+/week per muscle group \nor movement pattern\nConsider overlap \nbetween exercises.\nVIF SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS\nWhether your goal is strength, hypertrophy, or a blend of the two, here \nare some starting recommendations.\nWe discussed both the Schoenfeld and Ralston meta-analyses and \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n81\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthe overall body of evidence leaning towards ~10–20 sets per muscle \ngroup/movement per week as a good starting place for volume. We \nalso established how important muscle size is for strength development \nand how for strength, specificity is very important.\nWhile the best combination of volume, intensity and frequency (VIF) will \nbe highly individual and will change over a lifting career, we can use the \ncollective body of evidence to provide a starting point that is probably \nwithin the ballpark of optimal for most beginner to intermediate level lifters.\nWhether you want to get really strong or just really big, hypertrophy \nis important—bigger muscles move bigger weights. So, we want to \nassign a level of volume that is appropriate for building mass and then \nfor those interested in developing strength, we need to ensure that \nenough volume is performed in a specific enough way to develop the \nskill of strength.\nBelow are the summary recommendations for VIF, but remember that \nthese are the average values over the course of a training block. There \nwill be phases of training that emphasize higher or lower intensities \nand volumes depending on the time point in the periodized plan (more \nto come in the next chapter).\nVolume: 10–20 sets per muscle group or movement, per week.\n}\n} Remember to consider the overlap between similar movements on \nhow they affect both strength and the stimulus for muscle growth \nof the contributing musculature. \nIntensity: The 1–15 rep range at a 5–10 RPE should be the range that \nyou train in most of the time.\n}\n} If your main goal is strength, ⅔–¾ of that should be using the 1–6 \nrep range at a 5–10 RPE, and the rest should be lighter.\n}\n} If your goal is hypertrophy, ⅔–¾ should be in the 6–15 rep range at \na 5–10 RPE with the rest being both above and below this load level.\n}\n} Mostly, but not alway RPE should be between 5–10 depending on the \nphase of training, and goal of the session (for example a single at 80% \n1RM might be a 4 RPE, but is still useful skill work for a strength athlete)\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n82\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nFrequency: Train each muscle group or movement pattern at least \ntwice weekly.\n}\n} Balance your schedule and time with the appropriate volume for your \ntraining age and workload capacity to determine an appropriate \nfrequency.\nThis means 10–20 sets per muscle group/movement, with each \nmuscle/movement trained at least twice per week, using the 1–15 \nrep range in the 5–10 RPE range in most cases.\nConsider Overlap\nIf you think of some of the most common powerlifting routines, they \nwill only train deadlifts or squats heavy once per week, and once per \nweek light.\nSometimes squats might happen more frequently, but deadlifts less. \nTypically, the bench press is trained more frequently than the other \ncompetition lifts. This is because there is a lot of overlap between a hip \nhinge and a squat in terms of the muscles involved, even if the motor \npatterns of these movements are quite different. \nThus, if your goal is strength, while you do want to have a relatively \nhigh frequency of training on the movements you want to get stronger \nwith, you also have to consider how the overlap of fatigue from one \nmovement will affect another. For example, perhaps training squats \nthree times a week and deadlifts three times a week at a high volume \nand intensity wouldn’t be ideal for 90% of people because of the \noverlap and the subsequent local lumbar fatigue and the systemic \nfatigue caused by doing so. \nLikewise, for those considering hypertrophy as their primary goal, we \nneed to think more broadly about how the body works. \nJust because we think of certain exercises being “for” certain muscle \ngroups, the body does not “think” of movements as specific to muscle \ngroups. For example, it doesn’t think of the lat pulldown as only training \nthe lats—in fact, your pecs do aid slightly in shoulder extension [46], \nthink about how the pec is stretched when your arms are over your head; \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n83\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwhen it contracts, it aids the movement. Thus, something like a pullover \nor a cable lat pushdown will train both the lats and chest. Also, the triceps \ncross the shoulder, so the triceps also aid in shoulder extension [47]. So \nin reality, a lat pulldown doesn’t only train your “biceps and back” as \nyour average bodybuilder might think, but also the triceps and chest to \nsome degree. Thus, if you have been thinking about exercises in terms of \n“bench for the chest” and “overhead press for the delts”, you might be \nthinking a little too simplistically. The reality is that they both train delts. \nIf you are thinking about deadlift for the back and squats for the legs, \nthe reality is that they both train the back and legs (lumbar primarily). \nA better way to think of what muscles a movement trains is to consider \nthe biomechanical actions of a given muscle: how it moves a joint. While \nthe joint actions of every muscle group are beyond the scope of this text, \nyou can always use our friend Google and also simply think about what \nwould happen to any given joint if a specific muscle was to shorten.\nIn addition to joint actions, we need to consider the range of motion \nfor a given joint. For example, if you do a full range of motion close \ngrip lat pulldown, or chin up, you move through a full range of elbow \nflexion; however, in a row, you do not. Thus, certain pushing and pulling \nvariations are more likely to give a more complete stimulus to the biceps \nand triceps than others (typically full range of motion vertical pushing \nand pulling take the elbows through a more complete range of flexion \nor extension, and thus provide more stimulus to the arms). \nTo aid your biomechanical understanding of movements, you can view \nthis chart as a way to assess movements and which muscle groups \nare primarily and secondarily trained in each “type” of movement \n(this chart will come up again in Level 4, along with a similar chart for \ncategorizing movements for strength athletes).\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n84\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHypertrophy: Exercises and Muscle Groups Trained\nMovement Pattern\nPrimary Muscle \nGroups\nSecondary Muscle \nGroups\nSquat (all variations, \nleg press, single leg \nvariants)\nQuads, Glutes\nErectors (if free \nweights)\nHip Hinge (deadlift \nvariations, good \nmorning, back ext)\nGlutes, Hams, \nErectors\nScapular Retractors\nVertical Pull \n(chins, lat pull)\nLats, Bis\nRear Delts\nVertical Push\n(OHP variations)\nAnterior Delts, Tris\nMiddle Delts\nHorizontal Pull (row \nvariations)\nLats, Scapular \nRetractors\nRear Delts, Bis, Middle \nDelts\nHorizontal Push \n(flat, incline, decline \npushing variants)\nChest, Anterior Delts\nTris (CG/dips: \nprimary), Middle Delts \n(incline)\nHorizontal Hip \nExtension (hip thrust, \nglute bridge etc)\nGlutes\nHams\nPull Over (DB \npullover, lat \npushdown, BB \npullover etc)\nLats\nTris, Chest\nFly (cable crossover, \nDB flys)\nChest\nAnterior Delts\nIsolation Exercises\nTarget muscle\nN/A\nA Note on the Middle Deltoid\nIn bodybuilding, middle deltoid development is important to make you \nappear wider, and tapered. Due to this, I often see emphasis placed on \nlateral raise variations, and hear the concern that without their inclusion, \ndelt development will lack. While, I don’t dispute the importance of lateral \nraises (you will even see them in a sample hypertrophy program later \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n85\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nin this chapter), it should be noted that due to the delt’s biomechanics \nthe middle delts contribute significantly to many compounds lifts. To \nsome degree they are involved in any push or pull, but most notably \nduring horizontal pulling [48] and vertical pushing [49]; meaning, they \nget hit all the time. You only need to spend time isolating them if you \nare advanced, and they are a clear weak point.\nSo, given how often compound lifts cover your bases in terms of the \nmuscles they train, a question among strength-focused lifters might \nbe, is it ever appropriate to focus on just a few big lifts (i.e. just doing \n‘the big 3’)? Certainly, but that requires managing volume, intensity \nand frequency so as to manage any potential fatigue. For example:\n}\n} Rank beginners can benefit from the practice of the movements \nwith a higher frequency and a lower intensity. Sessions don’t need \nto be “all out” as progress comes easily and is largely driven by \ntechnique improvement.\n}\n} A powerlifter might train squat, bench, and deadlift very frequently \nat certain stages of competition preparation (with some days \nperforming all three on the same day), but often only one movement \nis heavy, the other one might be moderate reps at a moderate volume \n(doing your hypertrophy work), and the last might be singles at \n80%, to train technique which is not as fatiguing. Point being, there \nis a specific reason, a time restricted period this is done, and in a \nway to manage the fatigue overlap.\nEach is just an example, but as you can see, a high-frequency protocol \nrequires that you put more thought into overlap and fatigue management \nwith heavy compound lifts.\nA Starting Point from Which You Will Need to Adjust\nAvoid Black and White Thinking\nDon’t look at the volume, intensity and frequency guidelines with your \nabsolutist glasses on. Just because the number of sets we are recommending \nis in the 10–20 range, performing 9 sets doesn’t mean you won’t grow at all \nand performing 21 sets doesn’t mean you will overtrain and regress.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n86\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nAlso, when looking to compare other programs, remember, you can \nmake a good high-intensity, high-volume, or high-frequency program \nif you adjust the other variables. This means you may find an “optimal” \napproach that falls outside of these general guidelines—“optimal” for \nyou, if you adapt to it.\nProgress is not an on or off switch. It’s not that we make gains or we don’t, \nit’s maybe we make better progress by adjusting some of the variables.\nRemember the meta-analyses we have available are primarily on studies \ncomprised of novice trainees with few studies on “trained” lifters that I \nwould typically classify as intermediate. If you are a novice, start on the low \nend of the volume recs (~10–13 sets week). If you are more intermediate or \nadvanced (and you don’t know where to start), try the mid to high end of \nthe range (~14–20 sets a week), and then adjust from there.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n87\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWHEN UNSURE ABOUT HOW TO PROGRESS - FLOWCHART\nAre you plateaued? \nNo\nDon’t change anything.\nYes\nIs the answer “no” to any of the \nfollowing?\nSleeping 8+ hours?

Take a light \nweek. If that improved performance then \ngreat. If you quickly fatigue again and stall \nthen that probably means you need more \nthan just a deload or taper but should \nconsider doing less volume or organizing \nit differently to manage fatigue.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n88\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThese Are Principles and Guidelines, Not Rules\nThere isn’t a right or wrong way to train. We’re just trying to get you in \na ballpark of the right place to start so that you can adjust.\nThe recommendations are actually very wide-ranging when you think \nabout it. There is a twofold difference between doing 10 sets and 20 \nsets for a muscle group or movement. Despite its broad nature, you will \ntypically see a similar outcome in the majority of people training in this \nrange. Plus, these guidelines should just be seen as the average range \nthat will occur over the course of a cycle of training. There can and \nshould be periods that are above and below these ranges depending \non the phase of training. \nAlso remember, studies report averages, but each person is an individual \nand there are always outliers who will do best on substantially more or \nless volume or a lower or higher frequency than what we recommend. \nSo, start here, give yourself time, see if you progress, then think about \nadjustments.\n10–20 sets per muscle group/movement, a place to start and adjust \nfrom, not a law to live your life by.\nRemember, don’t get impatient. Volume will increase over the course of \na training career as you progress; however, it won’t necessarily increase \nfrom session to session, week to week, or month to month, because \nyou’ll have elements of periodization in your programming. The concept \nof needing more volume to grow is a concept to apply over a career \nof lifting, as needed when progress stalls. Don’t use this book to justify \ndoing full body 6 days a week with 20 sets per muscle group per session \nby next year because “volume has to keep increasing bro!”\nJust do enough volume to progress and only increase when you need, \nnot want, to do more.\nEXAMPLE ROUTINES\nLet’s have a look at what training routines we can get by manipulating \nthe variables that we’ve discussed so far. One each for strength and \nhypertrophy, four times a week. These are merely examples so don’t \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n89\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthink you need to follow them “to a t”.\nVolume • Intensity • Frequency\nSummary Of Recommendations\nVolume:\t\n10–20 sets per muscle group/movement per week\nIntensity:\t\nHypertrophy: Perform ⅔ – ¾ of volume in the 6–12 \nrep range, remaining ¼ – ⅓ split between the 1–6 \nand 15–20 rep ranges, at a 5–10 RPE.\t\nStrength: Perform ⅔ – ¾ of volume in the 1–6 rep \nrange, remaining ¼ – ⅓  in the 6–15 rep range, at a \n5–10 RPE.\nFrequency:\tEach muscle group/movement pattern trained 2+/\nweek.\nA Simple, Sample Strength Routine\nThe focus of the following routine is on developing strength of the \nmain lifts, and also the whole body. As such, there is not a great deal of \nattention paid to small details, growth in the long head of the triceps \nfor example. There is also overlap between exercises on the muscle \ngroups trained, which is a useful way to show the nuance to the volume \nrecommendations.\nMonday: Bench 5x5, Cable Pullover 3x8–12, Row 3x8–12\n}\n} The bench press trains the chest, anterior delts, and triceps.\n}\n} The pullover trains the lats, chest and triceps.\n}\n} The row trains the lats, scapular retractors, biceps, and rear delts. \nTuesday: Squat/Deadlift 5x5, RDL/Front Squat 4x6\n}\n} We alternate each week between the squat and deadlift.\n}\n} Squats are paired with Romanian deadlifts (RDLs), the deadlift is \npaired with the front squat. So, if squats are performed as the first \nexercise, then the second exercise is the RDL. On the deadlift day, \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n90\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nfront squats are performed as the second exercise.\n}\n} This pretty much trains the entire lower body (including the back \nto a degree, both lower and upper): glutes, hams, quads, and really, \noutside of some stimulation from squats, just the calves are neglected \n(but hey, who cares about calves if you’re a strength athlete).\nThursday: Bench 5x3, OHP 4x6, Weighted (if needed) Chins 3x6\n}\n} The bench works the chest, delts and triceps; the OHP the delts and \ntriceps, the chins work the lats, rear delts and biceps.\nFriday: Deadlift/Squat 5x3, F. Squat/RDL 4x6\n}\n} This is a similar workout to Tuesday, but the exercises are flipped \nand the set/rep ranges slightly altered. So, if the squat is performed \non Tuesday then deadlifts are performed on Friday. If the deadlift is \nperformed on Tuesday then squats are performed on Friday.\n}\n} Remember that the deadlift and RDL also train the lumbar and front \nsquats the upper back.\nHow Does This Stack Up with Our Recommendations?\nYou can see that the majority of the work is in the 6 rep and lower \nrange on the “main lifts”, with some accessory work in the 8–12. That’s \nroughly ¾ of the volume in the 1–6 range, roughly ¼ of the rest, higher.\nThe total number of sets is 10 for the bench, 9 for the squat and hip hinge \npatterns (including RDL and front squats), which is less than 10, but we \nare considering the overlap between these two types of movements. \nSo the main lifts we are trying to drive strength on are right at the \nbottom end of the volume range (but if we consider overlap on squats/\nhip hinges you could argue volume is higher). Also, we have accessory \nwork in the form of overhead pressing, overhead pulling, rows, and a \npullover to complement the fact that a bench press isn’t as effective for \nmiddle delts or triceps as it is for chest and anterior delts, and that sets \nof 3–5 aren’t as effective for hypertrophy as sets of 6+ reps.\nLet’s take a look at the back. To drive the discussion of overlap further, \nlet’s look at the back training. If you add up the pullover, row, and \nchin volume, it’s 9 sets, just short of our recommendations which is \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n91\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\na problem right? Well, not so fast. With the RDL, to retain scapular \nretraction and lumbar extension, it takes a lot of effort, and thus this \nshouldn’t be ignored. Likewise, the deadlift works the entire back to a \ndegree to maintain position. Depending on your own biomechanics, \nthe squat (especially if you use a low bar position) can be viewed the \nsame way. Finally, anyone who has performed front squats with any \ndegree of effort knows that the limiting factor is your ability to hold the \nfront rack position. Doing so is largely dependent on your upper back. \nSo, in some spots you could argue we aren’t hitting the minimum \nvolume guidelines...but, is this a big deal? No, this is the example of a \nstrength split where we are skirting the very lower end of the volume \nrecommendations. But don’t get too hung up on that falling a little \nshort, because the overlap of barbell compound free weight movements \n(and the resultant fatigue) is considerable. Remember, don’t think too \nblack and white about the guidelines, being slightly below them is fine. \nOur volume recommendations are based on studies where not much \noverlap occurred anyway due to free weight barbell exercises being \nused less in research (leg press vs. squats and deadlifts almost never \nused). Also, if you stall, it’s very easy to add a set here and there and/\nor potentially a fifth day.\nDon’t think that when writing a program you have to have at least 10 sets \nof direct work for each muscle group or movement no matter what. Again, \nthe research we are using to form our volume recommendations count a \nrow and a barbell curl as the same as far as stimulating biceps hypertrophy, \nso we can be equally as liberal in the way we count for comparative \npurposes. Thus, so long as you’re in the rough ranges provided with a little \nwiggle room for overlap, that’s absolutely fine as a starting point.\nSample Hypertrophy Routine\nThis sample hypertrophy routine is based on an upper-lower split set-\nup. The objective is to build muscle mass throughout the whole body. \nWe care about growing every muscle group primarily, not developing \nstrength, so overlap will be treated less liberally. \nMore isolation movements are incorporated in order to hit every single \nmuscle. The volume is greater, and there is also less heavy lifting.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n92\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nMonday: Bench 4x4–6, Row 3x6–8. Incline DB Press, Chins, \nTri’s, Bi’s, Lateral Raises, all 3x8–12\n}\n} The bench press and incline DB press train the chest, anterior delts, \nand triceps.\n}\n} The row trains the lats, scapular retractors, biceps, middle delts and \nrear delts while chins train the lats, biceps, and rear delts. \n}\n} Triceps and biceps direct work and lateral raises isolate and train \nthe triceps, biceps, and middle delts, respectively.\nTuesday: Squat, RDL 4x4–6.

Leg \nExtensions, Leg Curls, 3x12–15. Seated Calf Raise 4x8–12\n}\n} The leg press trains the quads and glutes without lumbar fatigue, \nwhile the weighted back extension trains the glutes, hams and \nlumbar extensors.\n}\n} Leg extensions, curls, and calf raises isolate and train the quads, \nhams, and calves, respectively.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n93\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHow Does This Stack Up with Our Recommendations?\nYou can see that the majority of the work is in the 6–12 range and a \nsmall amount is above and below. That’s roughly ¾ in the middle of \nthe range, roughly ¼ either side of that. As far as volume, there are 15 \nsets for glutes, 13 sets for chest, quads, and hams, 12 sets for biceps \nand triceps, and 12–16 sets for the delts, depending on which head \n(anterior, middle or rear) you are talking about. Although, four sets of \nbench, squat and deadlift are in the 4–6 rep range, so those sets are \nlikely slightly less stimulative for hypertrophy as I mentioned earlier in \nthis chapter. \nThus, this setup might be equivalent to say, one less set for each muscle \ngroup trained by these movements (chest, anterior delts, quads, glutes, \ntriceps). But, even then, all muscle groups are still over our minimal \nvolume target. However, as I mentioned earlier in this chapter, this \nis well worth it as there is value in doing some heavier training and \nregardless, we’re still in the appropriate volume range. \nThe only muscle group that might be slightly under-stimulated by this \napproach are the calves. They receive a total of 8 sets per week from calf \nraises; however, the gastrocnemius does cross the knee so hamstring \ncurls will hit them very slightly, and squats and leg press with a full range \nof motion will as well. Now if you look at the volume recommendations \nlike immutable laws, this will inevitably cause anxiety, but I would put \nforth you shouldn’t view the recommendations that way. \nRemember the goal is to learn about programming principles so you can \ndesign an optimal approach for your lifestyle, schedule, goals, training \nage, weaknesses and strengths. These example routines are just that, \nexamples, rather than what is optimal for you. They are science-based, \nbut the science on volume is limited, as there are substantial inter-\nindividual differences between people. This is a great place to start, \nbut they aren’t the be-all and end-all. In fact, I called these sample \n“routines” rather than programs because the acute variables don’t \nchange over time, which in a full program, they would. \nThese VIF recommendations are the average ranges that will occur over \nthe course of a phase of training. Individual phases of training may look \ndifferent. The next chapter will show how these recommendations play \nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n94\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nout over the course of different periodization models, and at the end \nof this book, comprehensive sample programs for novice, intermediate \nand advanced lifters training for bodybuilding and powerlifting will be \nshown to help you fully integrate and apply these concepts.\nVOLUME, INTENSITY, FREQUENCY\n95\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nReferences\n1.

This is \ncalled ‘The Principle of Progressive Overload’. However, progression and \nprogressive overload are not the same things. Setting up an appropriate \nvolume, intensity and frequency of training will result in overload, which \nwill then allow you to see progress. So in reality, progressive overload is \nlargely taken care of in the previous chapter. This progression chapter, \non the other hand, is more about planning into latter stages of a lifting \ncareer to ensure continued progress.\nIf you are a novice or early-stage intermediate lifter, simply setting up \na training plan specific to your goals with an adequate workload will \nproduce gains, without much effort put into creating a plan to ensure \nprogress. Selecting weights that challenge you on a session to session \nor week to week basis, even with the same set and repetition schemes \nwithin the week, will result in a gradual increase in strength and size. \nHowever, at a certain stage of your development, a plan for progression \nwill become important for continued progress.\nProgressions Based On Training Age\nThere are a great deal of inter-individual differences in terms of how \nquickly we can gain size and strength [1]; however, one thing is universally \ntrue—nobody can get bigger and stronger forever and everyone has \na genetic limit. In general, the closer we are to our limit; the slower \nprogress will be and the more intention will need to go into training in \norder to make further progress [2].\nWhen thinking about training age, as everyone is different, it is most \nuseful to categorize ourselves based on the length of time it takes to \nimprove (strength), rather than an arbitrary strength standard or the \nlength of time we have been lifting. The reason I don’t like to use an \narbitrary strength standard is because some people are just naturally \nstronger than others (they have an elevated level of baseline strength), \nbut they will still progress at a rate appropriate to their experience. \nLikewise, I don’t like to simply use training experience to categorize \ntraining age because many people spin their wheels for years without \npassing the late novice or intermediate stage, as they don’t know how \nPROGRESSION\n101\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nto progress once they reach this point. Thus, some lifters have been \nhitting the gym for over 10 years, but functionally are still intermediates, \nrelative to their genetic limits.\nThe further away someone is from their genetic limit; the more easily \nthey will be able to gain strength. This means that even for people who \nhave been going to the gym for a long time if they haven’t gained a \nlot of strength during that time, they may be able to get bigger and \nstronger pretty quickly with the appropriate changes to their training.\nVolume May Need to Increase Over Your Training Career\nThe key to progressing from novice to intermediate to advanced is \nproviding overload. As I’ve already pointed out, at the early stages, you \ncan simply add weight to the bar and do the same reps and sets and \nmake progress. But, this strategy often stops working, and when it does \nyou have to find a new way to induce overload. If you physically can’t \nadd weight to the bar (because you aren’t getting stronger), the solution \nis often an increase in volume (but not always, and not as a first option).\nAs in the graph on the following page, the bigger and stronger you \nget, the slower your progress will be. The same amount of volume will, \nunfortunately, produce less and less progress the more experienced \nyou become. When your progress stalls, an increase in volume may be \njust what you need. However, recall that it is possible to do too much \nvolume and negatively affect recovery as we discussed in Level 2. The \nkey is figuring out how much volume is appropriate based on your \nindividual needs and training age.\nPROGRESSION\n102\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHigh\nNovice\nIntermediate\nAdvanced\nLow\nTime\nGenetic Limit\nProgress\n0 3 6 9 12\n18\n24\n36\n48\n60\n72\n84 months\nProgram Complexity\nProgress Versus Progressive Overload\nIt’s easy to get hung up on strength gains. Obviously, if your goal is \nstrength your loads should increase. But, over time, your loads should \ngo up as well even if your goal is hypertrophy. \nThis is not to say that increasing load is what causes hypertrophy. Muscle \ngrowth occurs due to cumulative tension stimulus over time; however, \nbigger muscles are stronger muscles. Therefore, muscle growth should \neventually result in strength going up. But don’t get so hung up on \nstrength to the point that you think putting weight on the bar is the \nonly thing that matters, or that doing so is what causes hypertrophy. \nIt’s actually the other way around, increased strength is a sign that \nyou are providing an adequate overload for hypertrophy. You not only \nhave to apply a tension stimulus (performing at an adequate RPE) for \nmuscles to grow, but also ensure you have provided enough of that \ntension (volume; number of sets). \nIf you are gaining strength on most of your movements, that’s a good \nsign that you are providing adequate overload.\nPROGRESSION\n103\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHow Quickly Can We Gain Strength?\nIn Practical Programming for Strength Training, the authors suggest \nthat novices should be able to increase their performance workout \nto workout, intermediates from week to week, and advanced trainees \nfrom month to month\nNow, obviously there aren’t three distinct categories, it is a continuum, \nbut these rules of thumb are useful in that they express how progress \nslows the more progress you make.\nEven beyond the “advanced” level described by Rippetoe, for very high-\nlevel athletes progress can be even slower. Elite, natural bodybuilders \nmay only add 1 lb (~0.45 kg) of lean body mass to their stage weight in \nthe next competitive year; elite-level powerlifters may only add 15–30 \nlb (~7–14 kg) to their three-lift total from one season to the next (5–10 \nlb per lift), and some of the highest level Olympic lifters may only add \n17–25 lb (~8–11 kg) to their two-lift total in a four year Olympics cycle.\nThus, our approach to progression should differ between lifters of \ndifferent experience levels. However, before we get into how we provide \noverload at different levels, we have to discuss how we manage the \nfatigue of training as well; enter deloads.\nDeloads, Unloads, Tapers, And Light Microcycles\nWe know from the previous chapter/level that it is necessary to gradually \nincrease training intensity and volume in order to keep making strength \nand muscle mass gains. We also know from the discussion in the section \non volume that this cannot continue forever linearly, as residual fatigue \nwill build, hampering performance and eventually affecting our fitness. \nThis is why since the dawn of training programs, athletes and coaches \nfrom all disciplines have included periods of training where the overload \nis purposely less, or a week off is taken, or some plan to mitigate fatigue is \nemphasized. I’ve heard these periods referred to as light weeks, unloads, \nand other terminology, but these days, this is often referred to as a deload.\nSimply put, this is just a period (typically a week) where the volume of \ntraining is less compared to your moderate or hard weeks of training, and \nthe intensity might be lower as well (but not necessarily). The structure \nPROGRESSION\n104\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nof a deload is largely informed by the research on training ‘tapers’ (the \nsame concept as a deload, but specifically prior to testing or competing \nto improve performance). However, I want you to think of these periods \nnot as “special” or “different” from normal training, and rather to realize \nthat they should be incorporated into periodized plans because they \ncan optimize your rate of progress for a number of reasons.\nDeloads can prove beneficial because they help to reduce fatigue and \nthereby allow the expression of improved performance. As covered in \nthe Fitness-Fatigue Model, when we accumulate fatigue, we aren’t able \nto perform to our full potential. In strength training, this is when we \ncan’t lift as heavy or do as many reps as we normally would, which is \nnecessary to drive further training adaptations.\nAccumulated fatigue is a common cause of training plateaus, but with \na deload, we can expect to reduce fatigue, which then allows you to \ntrain harder and start making progress again as a result, in the time \nafter the deload.\nLikewise, deloads may also reduce the risk of injury. When we train, the entire \nbody is loaded including bones and connective tissues, not just the muscles. \nWhen we accumulate fatigue, we have greater risks of experiencing pains \nand injuries. The deload helps to prevent injury by allowing the connective \ntissues of the body to recover. Finally, deloads allow often-needed mental \nrecovery after especially difficult training blocks.\nIntroductory Cycles\nSomething very similar to a deload is an intro cycle. These are quite \nsimple, they are put at the beginning vs. the end of a block and they \nserve the purpose of acclimating you to a new (or “new” in your recent \ntraining history) level of fatigue. \nIf you jump right into doing 20 sets per muscle group and training near \nfailure, but previously were only doing 10 sets per muscle group at a \nlower RPE, things aren’t going to go well. You’ll initially get a crippling \nlevel of muscle damage (soreness) that will prevent you from being able \nto perform the target volume, that could have otherwise been avoidable. \nThe solution (well, besides not doubling your volume in the first place) \nPROGRESSION\n105\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nis to do an intro week, where you would do 75% of the volume you plan \nto be doing, at a slightly lower RPE than you plan to target. \nDeloads are useful after a volume block when going into an intensity \nblock (which I’ll explain later in this chapter) to dump fatigue before \ndoing higher-load, higher-RPE training. However, an intro week can \nbe useful when finishing an intensity block and moving into a volume \nblock, so you can acclimate to the higher volumes that you are no \nlonger accustomed to. So while they are largely the same concept, \nthey differ in purpose and are structured based on what’s coming, vs. \nwhat you already did.\nVolume Block > Deload > Intensity Block \nIntensity Block > Intro Week > Volume Block\nFor example, if you finished an intensity block with a week where you \ndid 10 sets per muscle group in the 3–6 rep range at an 8–10 RPE, and \nyou plan to do a volume block next, where in week 1 you will do 16 \nsets per muscle group in the 6–12 rep range at a 7–9 RPE, you could \nimplement an intro week between the two where you do 13 sets per \nmuscle group (3 fewer) in the 6–12 rep range at a 6–8 RPE (one lower). \nDoing this would put you in much better shape to handle the transition \nto higher volume versus jumping straight in.\nHow To Deload\nAgain I want to emphasize that deloads shouldn’t be seen as “different” \nfrom regular training, but should rather be “built into” a periodized plan. \nPeriods of low-stress training should be incorporated into all training \nplans, but how they are incorporated differs based on training age. \nFor novices, who do not require complex training approaches, the \napproach used to manage fatigue is also not complex. When progression \nis just a simple matter of making linear increases in load, a deload can \nbe as simple as a 10% reduction in the load used the next time that \nexercise is performed.\nAs one becomes more trained, the more traditional approach to a \ntaper, of reducing volume while keeping intensity relatively the same \n[3], becomes more appropriate.\nPROGRESSION\n106\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nDeloads For Novices\nAs the novice gradually increases the intensity session to session, there \nwill be a point where progress stalls. A good rule of thumb is that if you \nare unable to complete the target sets, reps, and load for two sessions in \na row, reduce the intensity by 10% while using the same number of reps \nand sets. The 10% lighter load should feel easy and will allow recovery. \nThen, the next session you return to the load you used in the session \nprior to the deload and attempt to pick up the progression once again.\nDeloads After The Novice Stage\nFor everyone else besides novices, you will more than likely have a more \nsystematic approach to training in order to achieve progress. Different \nweeks will have differing levels of stress, and deloads should simply be \nbuilt into your periodization as a way of progressing while managing \nstress. If you have high, medium and low training-stress microcycles \n(weeks), deloads are simply your low-stress training weeks.\nAs a decent rule of thumb, a week such as this should be roughly half of \nyour normal training volume (normal being the volume representative \nof a medium stress week), with an intensity similar to what you are \nused to handling. An easy way to accomplish this, is to just drop a set \nor two from each exercise, and reduce the rep range or rep target by \ntwo repetitions or so but while using the same loads so that the RPE \ndrops as well. Meaning, while the loading is similar to what you might \nbe used to, you are simply doing it for fewer reps and fewer sets so you \nare further from failure. For example, 3x10x200 lb becomes 2x8x200 \nlb. Volume load is just about half, and the RPE for each set should be \nabout 2 points lower.\nHowever, to fully understand how to integrate deloads into training \nprogression, you need to see how to actually set up training progressions \nin the first place. So, now let’s look at some sample progressions for \nnovice, intermediate, and advanced trainees in which these concepts \nare incorporated.\nProgressing As A Novice Trainee\nNovices can improve their lifting stats quickly because they have a lot \nPROGRESSION\n107\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nof room for progress. When you are just starting out, there will be a lot \nof things to learn so it is wise to start on a simple program, limiting the \nnumber of exercises and learning to train the whole body efficiently \nusing compound exercises.\nIf you’re using barbell exercises, use a weight that leaves a little bit in \nyour tank in order to make sure that your form is correct and then add \n5 lb to the bar each time you train. On heavy compound exercises like \nthe squat and deadlift, you may be able to add 10 lb each time.\nThere will be a point where your progress slows down and it is not \npossible to make even 5 lb increases session to session. If you have \nmicro plates (1 lb) you can use those to keep increasing the weight \neach session. If you don’t have access to these (as with most gyms) \nincrease the weight every other session, focusing on the feeling of it \nbeing easier in that second session (same weight, sets, reps, lower RPE).\nHere is an example of how a novice male, without micro-loading plates, \nmight progress with one of the large compound movements over the \ncourse of their first 29 training sessions.\nNote: The following example is not meant to imply that only five by five \nshould be performed; this is just an example of how to progress if, on a \ngiven day, five by five was programmed.\nPROGRESSION\n108\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nExample Novice Progression Using 5x5\nTraining \nsession\nLoad\nReps (total)\nDecision for \nnext session\nVolume\n1\n135 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n3375 lbs\n2\n145 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n3625 lbs\n3\n155 lbs\n5x5x5x5x3 (23)\nSame load\n3565 lbs\n4\n155 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n3875 lbs\n~omission~\n22\n245 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n6125 lbs\n23\n250 lbs\n5x5x5x4x3 (22)\nSame load\n5500 lbs\n24\n250 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n6250 lbs\n25\n255 lbs\n5x5x5x4x3 (22)\nSame load\n5610 lbs\n26\n255 lbs\n5x5x5x5x2 (22)\nDecrease load \n10%\n5610 lbs\n27\n230 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n5750 lbs\n28\n255 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n6375 lbs\n29\n260 lbs\n5x5x5x5x5 (25)\nIncrease load\n6500 lbs\nThis is just an example and obviously, you will want to adjust according \nto how you progress. But, pay attention to the following points:\n}\n} The load is increased linearly using the same rep range. This is \ncalled ‘single progression’ (of load) or often referred to as linear \nprogression (not to be confused with linear periodization). As a \nnovice, you don’t need much volume to progress, and if you are \ngetting stronger session to session, it’s a sign that volume is where \nit needs to be.\n}\n} When the target repetitions cannot be completed, the load is \nPROGRESSION\n109\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmaintained for the next session, and the repetition targets are \nattempted again.\n}\n} Reduce the load by 10% if you fail to achieve your target reps (or \nload) in two consecutive workouts. The next workout, return to the \nweight you were unable to complete the target repetitions with and \nyou will more than likely succeed.\nIf your progress starts to stall on multiple movements after implementing \n‘deloads’ as described above without a return to progress afterward \n(assuming 8 hours sleep a night, a slight caloric surplus, adequate \nprotein, balanced life stress etc.), it means the rate of progress you \ncan realistically achieve is probably slower than this single progression \nstrategy pushes for, and thus it is time to consider changing your \nprogression pattern to that of an intermediate trainee.\nProgressing As An Intermediate Trainee\nThis is likely to be appropriate for people that have been lifting \nintelligently (which should not be taken for granted) for more than 6 \nmonths and less than two years, but more importantly, is marked by an \ninability to consistently progress on a session to session basis. \nSome people can get to this stage in a matter of months if they have \nbeen using an appropriate program. Some people take years of going \nto the gym and still don’t make it to this stage if what they have been \ndoing is not effective.\nSample Intermediate Trainee Compound Movement \nProgression — ‘Linear Periodization’\nHere is a sample progression pattern for intermediate trainees with \ncompound movements. Let’s say that we have 3 sets using the 6–8 rep \nrange planned:\n}\n} Choose a weight where you can complete 3 sets of 8, without \nneeding a spot and rarely hitting failure on the last set (RPE below \n10 on set 3).\n}\n} Increase the load and reduce the number of reps the next time you \nperform a given exercise the following week.\nPROGRESSION\n110\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} The 4th-week workout with this movement is a potential deload \nwhere you assess if a reduction in load and reps is needed. (More \non when to deload later.)\n}\n} If a deload was needed, on the 5th-week workout, start over at 3x8 \nand increase the load the next smallest increment from what you \nused for 3x8 previously.\n}\n} If a deload wasn’t needed, do that on the 4th-week workout.\nIntermediate Trainee Compound Movement Progression \nExample - 3 sets of 6-8 reps\nTraining \nSession\nLoad\nReps\nVolume\n1\n110 lbs\n8, 8, 8\n2640 lbs\n2\n115 lbs\n7, 7, 7\n2415 lbs\n3\n120 lbs\n6, 6, 6\n2160 lbs\n4\n110 lbs\n6, 6 (deload)\n1320 lbs\n5\n115 lbs\n8, 8, 8\n2760 lbs\nThe load, reps and volume will fluctuate workout to workout, but the load \nbeing used will increase every repeat of the cycle. This is called ‘linear \nperiodization’, meaning that intensity goes up as volume goes down.\nThis approach can also be used with the 3–5, 4–6, and 5–7 rep ranges. \nIn each example, dropping the rep target by 1 rep is appropriate each \nweek with only a 5–10 lb (2.5–5 kg) increase in load week to week. \nThis wave loading intermediate progression can also be used with the \n“hypertrophy rep range” of 8–12, and in this case, you reduce the reps \nby 2 rather than 1 each week. So for example, you would do a week of \n12’s, 10’s, and then 8’s while increasing the load 5 lb to 10 lb each week \n(in most cases I would recommend 5 lb).\nWave Loading Periodization Example\nEssentially, using this approach results in ‘wave loading’, where the same \npattern occurs over and over, albeit with increases in load over time. This \nsetup is appropriate when you are doing an adequate volume (number \nPROGRESSION\n111\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nof sets), which results in steady increases in volume load wave to wave \nas strength increases. The graph below illustrates how a 4-week period \n(a mesocycle) ending in a deload, when successful (you can increase \nloads), results in greater volume load relative to the last mesocycle due \nto the steady strength increases. If you are able to keep making the \nload increases each cycle, it means the volume is appropriate for you \nas it is producing the adaptation. However, this approach is really only \nappropriate for compound lifts or exercises where the absolute load \nbeing used is relatively high.\nTOTAL VOLUME\nWEEKS\n0\n8\n15\n23\n30\nVOLUME\n0\n450\n900\n1350\n1800\nSample Intermediate Trainee Isolation Movement \nProgression — ‘Double Progression’\nFor isolation exercises, it is not realistic to increase load as quickly. If \nI use myself as an example, I’ve increased my bench press from 155 lb \nto 363 lb (~70 to 165 kg) over the course of my lifting career. This is \nmore than a doubling of my strength in the 14 years that I have trained \nand in absolute terms, that is an increase of 208 lb (~95 kg). Thus, at \nthe intermediate level, it is reasonable to expect to make increases \nof 5 lb (~2.5 kg) on compound lifts such as this every 5 weeks (as \noutlined in the progression above) for a long period of time. However, \nwith isolation exercises this is not a reasonable expectation.\nImagine trying to add 5 lb to your dumbbell bicep curl every fifth week—\nit is simply an unrealistic amount of progress. That would be ten, 5 lb \nincreases every year, requiring an addition of 50 lb (~23 kg) to your \nbicep curl each year when most people can’t even dumbbell curl 50 lb \nPROGRESSION\n112\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nfor one strict rep. So, obviously we can’t increase isolation exercises as \nfast. Think about it in relative terms: If your max squat is 355 lb (~160 \nkg), a 5 lb increase is an increase of about 1.5%; If your max dumbbell \ncurl is 50 lb a 5 lb increase is an increase of 10%. So that same 5 lb \nincrease is over six times more of an increase for a curl than a squat.\nTherefore, we need another approach for isolation exercises. One such \napproach is to add reps week by week, instead of increasing load. \nEssentially, where we are adding volume before increasing intensity, \nrather than adding intensity while decreasing volume. This is called \ndouble progression — we don’t progress the second variable until we \nprogress the first.\nThe first variable in this example is repetitions. In this example, we’ll use \n3x12–15 as the target (though this can be done with the 8–12 or other \nrep ranges as well).\n}\n} Choose a load you can do at least 3x12 with, without hitting failure \non your third set.\n}\n} Add reps each week, trying to get to the goal of 3x15. Take as many \nsessions as you need to achieve 3x15. Avoid hitting failure until the \nlast set, or you’ll sabotage your next sets.\n}\n} In the example, we have the 4th week as a deload (more on when \ndeloads would be later). Regardless of what happens in the week \nprior to a deload, in deload weeks go to the bottom of the rep \nrange and just do two sets (12, 12).\n}\n} After the deload you will hopefully come back, find yourself \nrecovered and improve performance (in the example it shows the \nhypothetical person gets 15, 15, 14). Then in the next week, 15, 15, 15.\n}\n} Thus, now that the target is met, in the next session we increase \nthe load, once again working back towards 3x15. There is no preset \ntime frame or pattern for when this occurs, you just go up in load \nonce you achieve 3x15.\nPROGRESSION\n113\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIntermediate Trainee Isolation Movement Progression \nExample - 3 sets of 12-15 reps\nTraining \nSession\nLoad\nReps\nVolume\n1\n40 lbs\n14, 13, 12\n1560 lbs\n2\n40 lbs\n14, 14, 12\n1600 lbs\n3\n40 lbs\n14, 14, 13\n1640 lbs\n4\n40 lbs\n12, 12 (deload)\n960 lbs\n5\n40 lbs\n15, 15, 14\n1760 lbs\n6\n40 lbs\n15, 15, 15\n1800 lbs\n7\n45 lbs\n13, 12, 12\n1665 lbs\nThis is an example of how an intermediate trainee can still make pretty \nvisible linear progress on a more or less week to week basis. Also, if \ngoing up in load after adding reps is too difficult in a narrow rep range \nsuch as 8–12 or 12–15, you can widen the rep range to accommodate \nload progression if you simply can’t progress that quickly. Meaning, \nwhen the absolute load on an isolation movement is so low (e.g. going \nfrom 20 lb to 25 lb on lateral raises is a 25% increase) that the next jump \nin weight is too heavy to allow training in the same rep range, you can \nuse double progression in a wider rep range. For example, let’s say you \ndid 3x12x15 lb on lateral raises building up from sets of 8, but you could \nonly do 7 reps when you went to 20 lb, then it might make more sense \nto do double progression from 8–15 reps vs. 8–12 on this movement. \nAlso, this progression pattern isn’t just restricted to isolation exercises. \nAny movement that forces a larger jump than you would otherwise \nprefer is a good candidate for double progression. For example, smaller \nindividuals using DB compound movements are forced to make a 5 lb \njump per dumbbell, which is often too much. This would be a good \ntime to use double progression.\nFinally, for those focused on strength as an indicator of progress, \nremember the ability to add reps with the same load is an increase in \nstrength; and being able to add more reps tells you that the stimulus is \nPROGRESSION\n114\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nadequate to make you adapt.\nProgressing as an Advanced Trainee\nThis is for people who have gained 80–90% of their genetic potential \nin terms of strength and/or hypertrophy, and are seeking to get the \nremaining 10–20%.\nFor the purposes of progressing you can consider yourself advanced if \nyou have been seriously training in an intelligent manner for more than \ntwo years continuously, the rate of progress has substantially slowed \ndown compared to what it was in your first year or two of training, and \nmost importantly even when doing everything right you can’t meet \nthe progression timelines listed above for intermediates. Notice, I don’t \ndefine advanced by your development of muscle mass or strength. I \nhave trained lifters who developed natural, pro-caliber physiques in \ntheir first year of lifting, or who attained an elite total one weight class \nhigher than the one they compete in after one year of training for \npowerlifting. Yes, in terms of performance these athletes are elite, but in \nterms of their personal genetic potential, they were still intermediates \n(as scary as that may be).\nOn the flip side, some people just don’t have the natural genetic talent \nto perform at an elite level compared to others in the field but are still \nadvanced in terms of how close they are to their own potential; how \nquickly they can progress and thus, how they should be training. \nI’ll use myself as an example. I’ve been training progressively for about \n14 years. Currently, on a good day after a strength phase and a taper, I \ncan total ~1400 lb (~635 kg) on my 3-lift powerlifting total at 198–205 \nlb (90–95 kg) body weight. In unequipped drug-free powerlifting, this \nis a decent total, it’s a solid 400 Wilks score. However, at IPF worlds, it \nwould place me in the last or second to last position (not that I would \nqualify), with the best lifters in my weight class hitting around and above \nan 800 kg total. I’m not an elite powerlifter and I’m not “advanced” by \nthat standard, almost certainly never will be, but this doesn’t mean I’m \ndone improving, or that I can’t improve as an advanced lifter. (In fact, \nat the time of writing the first edition of this book three years ago, my \ntotal was 5 kg lower, so there is hope for us all!) Rather, the point is that \nPROGRESSION\n115\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n“advanced” for one person, might be a far cry from what “advanced” is \nfor another. However, if your rate of progress is very slow because you \nare near your ceiling, your training program should follow advanced \nlifter guidelines, regardless of how you compare to others.\nNot everyone can be a world-class performer, but everyone can push \nthemselves nearer to the limits of their own talents. However, to get to \nthe point where you actually find out what you are truly capable of takes \ntime, commitment, dedication, desire and discipline. The more advanced \nyou are, the more clearly defined your goal will need to be and you will \nneed to train accordingly. Progress will be hard fought and slow and not \napparent on a week to week, or even month to month basis. So you need \nto plan your training and measure your progress periodically.\nThere are a few ways that I recommend people do this. \n1.\t\nOne way is to perform and compare a 1-rep max (1RM).\n2.\t\nThe second is to do as many reps as possible (AMRAP) with a\ngiven weight, also known as completing a repetition maximum\n(RM). An estimated 1RM can be derived from an AMRAP/RM, and\nthen compared to a previous test (these tests don’t necessarily\nneed to be performed to a 10 RPE).\n3.\t\nFinally, and what I primarily recommend, is comparing\nperformances when programming load via RPE to see if strength\nis trending upwards during a block. For example, you can program\na single rep at a 7 RPE prior to doing the rest of your working\nsets, and this would be your estimated four repetition maximum\n(a single at a 7 RPE means three repetitions in reserve).\nIf you want to estimate 1RM  from AMRAPs and  RPE-based \nperformances, I advise using ~5RM or heavier to ensure a more accurate \nassessment of strength (the higher the reps you do to estimate strength, \nthe less accurate). For example, you could do a 5RM AMRAP, you could \ndo 2 reps at a 9 RPE (a 3RM, just estimated based on when you believe \nyou have 1 rep remaining), or two reps at an 8 RPE (an estimated 4RM). \nThen you can calculate an estimated 1RM from that performance. \nWith that said, you can certainly gauge progress with actual or RPE \nPROGRESSION\n116\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nestimates of your 6, 8, 10 or even higher RM values; however, you \nsimply shouldn’t use these performances to estimate a 1RM as it will be \ninaccurate and lead to inappropriate load prescription. Rather, if loads \nare progressing in your higher-rep performances it does tell you that \nprogressive overload is occurring, which is useful for bodybuilders in \ngeneral, or strength athletes in volume blocks. \nIn the next two sections, I’ll dive into the specific applications of these \ntesting concepts for both strength and hypertrophy.\nTracking Progress When Training For Strength\nIf you are training primarily to increase your 1RM, you want most of \nyour tests of progress to be semi-specific to your goals. That means, \ntesting that is representative of your absolute strength. For example, a \npowerlifter would use changes in estimated or actual 1RM strength to \nmonitor progress in the big three lifts (or whatever lifts you are focused \non increasing maximum strength on if you are not a powerlifter). \nAs it’s mentally and physically tough to regularly challenge your 1RM, it is \nimportant not to do this too frequently (or to do it only at targeted points \nin your periodization plan). The key is to make sure that the intervals \nbetween 1RM tests are long enough that a measurable difference in \nperformance can be observed. Every 6–12 weeks is generally a good \ntime frame for most advanced trainees.\nFor example, if you’re a man of average weight currently squatting 440 \nlb (200 kg), or a woman of average weight squatting 275 lb (125 kg), \nit might take some time to make further progress. You might not see \nprogress in the next few weeks, but you may be able to periodize your \ntraining to achieve a 5 lb (~2.5 kg) increase in an 8-week period to bring \nyour 1RM up to 445 lb (~202.5 kg) or 280 lb (~127.5 kg).\nIf you manage to repeat the cycle for a year, it will add up to 30 lb (~14 \nkg), which is great progress for someone at this level of advancement.\nAs you can surely imagine, there will be a point where a lifter becomes \nadvanced enough that even 30 lb added to a lift in a year is not a \nreasonable expectation. In these cases, planning becomes a bigger \nemphasis, and often strength athletes use a model where a few months \nare spent simply increasing volume without necessarily expecting a \nPROGRESSION\n117\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmeasurable increase in strength. In block periodization (which we will \ncover in detail later), this is called an accumulation phase [4].\nAfter a new level of work capacity has been established in this phase \nof training, and the athlete is able to perform reasonably heavy loads \nfor larger volumes than they could previously, an intensification period \nis implemented whereby volume is reduced and intensity is increased. \nThis is finished with a taper, leading to strength testing. The entire time \nspent going from accumulation to intensification to tapering to testing \ncould last up to 4 months. Thus, high-level advanced lifters might only \ntest their strength three times per year (less if they compete, as these \nfunction as tests).\nBy the end of the year, lifters may also need to recover from the work \ndone to get to new strength levels or perform at peak capacity. Such a \nhigh level of fitness is typically not maintainable year round. This is seen \nin all sports; world-class sprinters don’t run sub 10 second 100-meter \nsprints year-round, bodybuilders don’t stay in peak condition year-\nround, and endurance athletes don’t set new time trial records year-\nround either. The same is true in strength sport.\nThus, after the last ‘peak’ of the season, very advanced lifters may spend \nthe first month or two in the ‘offseason’ performing lower-volume, \nlower-intensity training, less specific training, recovering from the peak \nin performance. In fact, it may be a few months after this recovery \nperiod before previous, or new levels of strength, are displayed.\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that high-level lifters only know their \nstrength levels a couple of times per year and during competitions. \nFor one, your strength doesn’t change by large amounts at this stage, \nso programming loads is a bit easier and predictable. Also as mentioned \nearlier, you don’t necessarily have to do 1RM testing to gauge strength. \nIf you are tracking RPE or using it to prescribe load, you can gauge \nstrength in an ongoing fashion. For example, if you are doing triples at \nan 8–9 RPE, you know that the load you used is roughly your 4–5RM \ndepending on how fresh you are. \nAdditionally, there is a time and a place for testing strength without \ntesting 1RMs. For example, you could conclude an accumulation block \nwith AMRAPs to see if you have increased your 6RM. Thus, without \nPROGRESSION\n118\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nnecessarily testing 1RM you can gauge if your training is progressing.\nLikewise, if you are trying to control and manage fatigue, 1RM or AMRAP \ntesting does not have to occur at a 10 RPE. Advanced lifters, especially \nthose familiarized with using RPE in training, are quite accurate at \ngauging repetitions in reserve at the completion of a set when they are \nnear failure [5, 6]. Therefore, testing can be performed to an 8 or 9 RPE \nand the final repetition(s) can be assumed to have been successful for \nthe purposes of estimating 1RM, but not actually performed in order to \nmanage fatigue.\nTracking Progress When Training For Hypertrophy\nAt the advanced stage of your lifting career, you are not going to be \nable to increase your muscle mass at a pace that makes objective \nphysique measurement and evaluation possible over any reasonable \ntime frame. Thus, even if you are training to compete in a physique \ncontest (or if you’re trying to build a physique like those athletes) it \nis best to use changes in strength as the measure of progress versus \nvisual assessments, caliper, or tape measurements.\nTo help you understand why, consider that it is not uncommon for \nadvanced natural bodybuilders to compete every other year, or to take \na few years off between seasons to make offseason progress. However, \nthe progress they’ve made is often subtle enough that one cannot see \nit until these bodybuilders have dieted down again and competed (and \neven then, the changes are not often pronounced). In fact, frequently \nin these cases stage weight might only have increased by a pound or \ntwo (if at all, often they get better at maintaining muscle and come in \nleaner at the same weight, or just come in leaner, competing lighter \nthan prior years). This is not to say large changes in stage weight never \noccur in natural, advanced bodybuilders, but when they do occur it \nis almost always a case of improved contest prep practices leading \nto better muscle retention, versus gaining much more muscle in the \noffseason.\nTo further put this in perspective, consider that all the available methods \nof measuring body composition have typical errors. In all cases, the \ntypical error is larger than the progress that can be reasonably expected \nto be made in a sensible time period at this level. For example, even \nPROGRESSION\n119\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\na DXA scanner, the supposed “gold standard” of body-fat percentage \ntesting, might have a + or -5% typical error, meaning that unless you \ncan increase your lean body mass by more than 5% you can’t reliably \nknow if you had gained, maintained or lost lean body mass as it could \nhave been covered up by this “noise”. However, a 5% increase in lean \nbody mass for an advanced natural bodybuilder might be 9 lb (~4 kg)! \nNine pounds is a lot of muscle mass, especially at this stage. If it is \neven possible for the advanced lifter in question to gain a further 9 lb \nof muscle, it might take multiple years to do so and obviously tracking \nprogress every few years isn’t frequent enough to let you know whether \nyour last training block was successful.\nTherefore, you can see why at this level measuring progress by eye, tape \nmeasure, calipers or even lab measures is no longer appropriate and \nmeasuring performance instead becomes important. In essence, instead \nof measuring whether or not hypertrophy is occurring, you measure \nwhether or not your training is producing progressive overload, which \nindicates hypertrophy is likely occurring if your training is appropriately \ndesigned.\nIt is not necessary to perform single rep maxes to test progress. Indeed, \nas a bodybuilder you may not even include 1RMs in your training at all. \nYou may not even perform any of the big three lifts that powerlifters \nperform, preferring perhaps the RDL, front squat, and incline bench \npress instead; likely using more than three lifts to gauge progress as \nwell. In this case you can use periodic AMRAPs to test strength on \nyour primary compound lifts to see how you are progressing. Or, you \ncan perform AMRAPs to a submaximal RPE; e.g. 6 reps at a 9 RPE. \nYou can then directly compare your performance to previous AMRAPS \nwith the same or lighter weights, or if you want to compare AMRAPs \nwith different loads, you can estimate a 1RM (so long as you are using \nestimated 5RMs or heavier). To do so, you would simply use a 1RM \ncalculator to estimate your one rep max using equations based on your \nAMRAP, comparing it to your last AMRAPs estimated 1RM.\nTo do that you can use the calculator we created for you on our site \nhere. Just enter the reps you have done and the load. This can be \nused to assess progress, and also to program load if you are using a \npercentage 1RM based program in the next phase of your training.\nPROGRESSION\n120\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nNote:\n}\n} When performing an AMRAP with the purpose of estimating a 1RM, \nit’s best to stick with an estimated ~5RM or heavier (e.g. an actual \n5RM, or a 3RM, or 2 reps at a 9 RPE, 3 reps at an 8 RPE, etc.). \nAny higher than that and we start to get out of the range of being \nable to accurately estimate a 1RM, and thus future loading based on \npercentages won’t be as appropriate.\n}\n} Powerlifters can also use AMRAPs to program their accessory \nmovements or gauge progress in periods where volume is the \nfocus. Again, you can use AMRAPs to submaximal RPE’s, like a 9 \nRPE (just enter one more rep completed into the calculator) to \navoid entering snap-city™, especially with free weight, technically \ndemanding, high-risk exercises like the deadlift and squat variants.\nDo You Even Need to Test Strength?\nConsider this, if you just trained to failure all the time, you wouldn’t \nneed to test your strength to gauge progress, as you would always be \ntesting your limits. While true, there are downsides to training to failure \nthat make that a suboptimal option. \nHowever, savvy readers may have realized as they read the two previous \nsections, that if you track RPE while training, you have a constant \nestimation of your RM at any given load. Indeed, a lifter who tracks \ntheir training and who can accurately track RPE probably does not \nneed to do an AMRAP or 1RM to test, as they have an ongoing log of \ntheir performance trends. \nThe upsides to testing strength is that you can mimic the competition \nenvironment if you are a competitive strength athlete. You can do a trial run \nof your taper, even do your weight-cut protocol if you have one, and come \nin on a Saturday morning and run a mock meet. This will not only help you \ndetermine the efficacy of the final stage of your meet prep strategy, but \nalso get you more used to the competition experience. However, if you are \na physique competitor or not interested in competitively showcasing your \nstrength, there truly is no need to test your strength if you are familiar and \naccurate with gauging RPE in training.\nPROGRESSION\n121\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWhat To Do as an Advanced Lifter When You Don’t Progress\nIf you get to the point where your strength makes no measurable \nprogress over an 8–12 week period, then you can go back to the progress \nflow chart discussed in Level 2:\nPROGRESSION\n122\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWHEN UNSURE ABOUT HOW TO PROGRESS - FLOWCHART\nAre you plateaued? \nNo\nDon’t change anything.\nYes\nIs the answer “no” to any of the \nfollowing?\nSleeping 8+ hours? Energy surplus? \nProtein 0.7g/lb+ (1.6g/kg+)? Neither \nover or under estimating RPE? \nTraining muscles/lifts min 2x/week? Is \nyour technique solid?\nYes\nFix that, run another \nmesocycle, reassess.\nYes\nIt may be time to \nincrease your volume.\nNo, I’ve taken care of all of those.\nOk, are you recovering?\nDreading the gym? Sleep quality \nworse than normal? Load/reps actually \ndecreasing? Life stress seems worse \nthan normal? Aches and pains feel \nworse than normal?\nNo to all, or all but 1 question: \nyes, you’re likely recovering.\nYes to 2 or more: no, you are likely not.\nNo\nTemporarily reduce volume. Take a light \nweek. If that improved performance then \ngreat. If you quickly fatigue again and stall \nthen that probably means you need more \nthan just a deload or taper but should \nconsider doing less volume or organizing \nit differently to manage fatigue.\nPROGRESSION\n123\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nOn Implementing Deloads\nIf you’ve taken care of nutrition, sleep, stress, training configuration, \nand effort, and you’re not recovering, it may just be that you need to \ninsert a light week (deload) into your training. \nAs you saw in the previous examples of progression at each experience \nlevel (novice, intermediate, advanced), deloads should be worked into \nyour training. However, a lot more goes into your recovery status than \nsimply volume and intensity and even a well-planned program with \nappropriately timed deloads will never get it right. It’s easy to have \nthem too frequently or too infrequently as you can’t predict life stresses, \npoor nights of sleep, illness, etc. \nThus, my preferred method of implementing deloads (in non-dieting \nconditions) is to use a checklist after each mesocycle progression to \nassess recovery.\nIf you recall from the linear, wave loading style intermediate progression \nwhere you step down reps while stepping up the load for three weeks, \nyou have the option of a deload in week 4. However, you may not need \nit and be able to simply rinse and repeat with heavier loads (i.e. you \nwent wk1: 3x8x100 lb, wk2: 3x7x105 lb, wk3. 3x6x110 lb and you are \ncapable of going right to 3x8x105 lb). \nBut how do you know if you need a deload or not? \nCheck out the checklist below. If you answer yes to two or more \nquestions, it’s not a bad idea to implement a deload.\nPost Block Assessment\nDreading the gym?\nSleep worse than normal?\nLoads/reps decreasing?\nStress worse than normal?\nAches and pain worse than normal?*\nYes to 0–1 questions: start next meso\nYes to 2+ questions: deload week\n*Yes only to aches and pains, high rep week\nPROGRESSION\n124\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nOn Making Volume Decreases:\n}\n} If you’ve taken care of nutrition, sleep, stress, your training \nconfiguration (appropriate spread of training stress across \nsessions), and RPE is appropriate, and you’re not recovering, and \nyou’ve performed a deload but quickly find yourself in the same \nunder recovered position again, you probably need to cut back on \nthe volume systemically. You are probably simply doing too much, \nAs an aside, if you only say yes to having joint/tendon pain, you can \nprobably do a “normal” training week in terms of volume and RPE, but \njust up the reps to being 12–20 and if that’s not enough to be pain free, \nyou could even lower the weight more and use blood flow restriction \n(BFR)—more on this in a second—for single joint movements. The \nsecond rule of thumb though, is that if you go through three consecutive \nmesocycles of training without a deload, no matter what, run one just \nto be safe.\nBFR training is an interesting method of training used primarily \nin clinical settings whereby a blood pressure cuff, bandage, wide \ntourniquet or knee wraps (in the bro world) are applied at the proximal \nlimb (upper thigh or armpit) during training so that venous blood flow \nout of a muscle is restricted, while arterial blood flow into the muscle is \nmaintained. This prevents metabolites from clearing, results in earlier \nrecruitment and fatigue of muscle fibers, and allows training loads as \nlow as 20–30% of 1RM to be just as effective for hypertrophy (but not \nstrength) as heavier loads (but not more effective [7]). This can be \nvery useful when experiencing joint pain in the knees or elbows as \nyou can maintain a muscular stimulus, with a load much lower than \nnormal which may facilitate joint recovery [8]. So if you do happen to \nanswer “yes” to the specific question related to aches and pains due \nto elbow or knee discomfort, you can swap out single joint exercises \nfor BFR versions where you use a knee wrap (or flexible bandage, \nor even a specialized wrap sold for BFR specifically) wrapped to a \n7/10 tightness. There should be no tingling in your limb and your limb \nshouldn’t change color (shouldn’t turn purplish), and if either happens \nit’s too tight. Then, perform your normally programmed number of \nsets to failure using 20–30% of 1RM.\nPROGRESSION\n125\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nsuch that only a microcycle or two puts you in the hole requiring a \ndeload, which is an inefficient ratio of stress to recovery.\n}\n} In this case, you need to simply do less volume. A decent place to \nstart for a volume reduction is ~20% across the board in terms of \nsets per muscle group/movement. So if you were doing 15 sets for \na muscle group or movement, you’d go down to 12. Then, see if \nyou can progress more consistently without having to constantly \naddress overreaching. \nOn Making Volume Increases:\n}\n} Very frequently, a technique issue is preventing you from getting \nstronger, or bigger and adding more volume is not the answer. It’s \na good idea to regularly evaluate your form, either with a coach, \nor video feedback compared to an example of good form (check \nout The 3DMJ Lifting Library in the resources section) or by some \nother more objective method. \n}\n} If your technique is solid and all other potential bottlenecks are \nnot causing the plateau (sleep, nutrition, life stress, training \norganization), you can increase volume by adding more sets across \nthe board, on specific exercises, or by adding more exercises to \nyour workouts.\n}\n} If you’ve plateaued on multiple upper and lower body lifts or muscle \ngroups, adding 1–2 sets (yes just one or two) per muscle group/\nmovement pattern is a good place to start. When working in the \n10–20 sets per muscle group/movement pattern range, that’s a 10% \nincrease in volume, which is a good increase. \n}\n} If you are plateaued on a lift or muscle group that you specifically \nwish to improve then you should probably consider doing more \nsets of that lift or for that muscle group. For example, a powerlifter \nthat has stalled on their squat who is doing 12 sets of squats and \nsquat variants per week, should probably try doing 1–2 more sets of \nsquatting as a first go-to solution.\n}\n} For strength athletes, it is also possible that a stall is simply due to \nneeding more muscularity, so there are times when adding more \naccessory movements (or sets on accessory movements you are \nPROGRESSION\n126\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nalready doing) might be a good idea. If you are a lean powerlifter at \nthe top of your weight class and you are plateaued, for this reason, \nit may be worth considering moving up a weight class.\n— Add the volume in an intelligent place. We’ll talk more about this in \nLevel 4: Exercise Selection.\nOn Making Training Frequency Increases\nAs you add more volume, remember from Level 2 that you don’t want \nany day to get overloaded. So, you need to think about when it’s time \nto add more days of training to accommodate volume increases. If \nyou’re starting to push the limit of how much quality training you can \nperform in your sessions (if you start to notice performance dropping \noff for a given lift, type of lift—pushing, pulling, squatting—or muscle \ngroup), consider adding another training day to spread out the work \nmore effectively.\nOverview Of Periodization Models\n‘Periodization’ is simply the process of organizing training into periods. \nThese periods are followed in a logical order, for the purpose of optimizing \nlong-term adaptations, while avoiding stagnation and injury. Single \nweeks of training are often referred to as microcycles, longer blocks of \ntraining often lasting one to two months are called mesocycles, and the \nentire training plan for a given period (often a season or a year) or a \ncollection of sequenced mesocycles is called a macrocycle [8].\nPeriodization encompasses the manipulation of a wide range of variables \nto include volume, intensity, frequency, rep range, exercise selection, \nexercise order, and rest intervals, etc., and that is why it is placed outside \nThe Pyramid, as it is an overarching theme relevant to all levels.\nThere are many different periodization models. As a novice, the  \nperiodization approach you utilize will likely not make a difference \nin terms of the gains you make [9, 10]. However, as an intermediate \nor advanced lifter, the organization of your training becomes more \nimportant and can make a difference [11-18]. Thus, a discussion of the \nvarious models is needed.\nPROGRESSION\n127\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWe will cover linear periodization, block periodization, and undulating \nperiodization (specifically daily undulating periodization, often \nabbreviated to DUP) as they are the most common models in practice.\nLinear periodization also known as Western periodization is a model \nof training planning in which volume decreases as intensity increases \nover time.\nIn the original Western periodization model, this was manifested by \nathletes going through different phases of training for preparation, \ncompetition, and the transition out of the competition season back to \nthe offseason. Typically, this started with months of training dedicated \nto higher-volume, lower-intensity work, such as hypertrophy and \nmuscular endurance work, followed by months of training dedicated to \nlower-volume, higher-intensity strength training, and culminating with \nlower-volume power training before tapering and peaking performance \nfor competition.\nOver the course of the model, training becomes more sport-specific \nas the athlete gets closer to competition. Hypertrophy and muscular \nendurance build the base of fitness and structural adaptations. Then, \nthe strength mesocycle increases the ability to recruit the newly added \nstructure to produce higher forces.\nFinally, the athlete trains to develop power by lifting lighter loads as \nfast as possible. The adaptations from high-velocity training combined \nwith the adaptations from the strength phase mean greater power \noutput (power in physics is force multiplied by velocity). This final \nphase is the most sport-specific for most athletes as they are typically \nmoving their bodies, opponents’ bodies, and lightweight implements \nlike balls, pucks, rackets or bats through space. Therefore, light-load, \nhigh-velocity training is thought to have the most functional transfer \nto sports performance.\nHowever, it’s important to note that all periodization models are \nintended to be adapted according to the unique demands of each sport. \nFor example, low-load, high-velocity power training is less specific to \na strength athlete than actual strength training. Yet, in the traditional \nWestern model power comes after strength. \nSo, for a powerlifter would you conclude a peaking cycle with 40% of \nPROGRESSION\n128\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n1RM jump squats? No, you would continue from the strength phase, \ndoing lowered volume, high-intensity strength training, which in the \ncase of a powerlifter would be more sport specific. A simple example of \nlinear periodization in action is in the “Intermediate Trainee Compound \nMovement Progression” table from a few pages back, in which volume \ndecreases as intensity rises.\nBlock periodization is arguably a simpler, more flexible form of \nperiodization that shares many similarities with linear periodization but \nwas developed to address some of the potential shortcomings that \ncome with the traditional linear approach.\nBlock periodization divides the macrocycle into 3 (generally) separate \nblocks (mesocycles), with different goals for each block. Like linear \nperiodization, it starts with a high-volume, lower-intensity block, then \nmoves into a lowered-volume, higher-intensity block, then culminates \nin a taper to peak performance.\nThe main difference between block and linear models is that the \nmesocycles are shorter than in linear periodization. In traditional \nlinear periodization, one spends multiple months training only for \nhypertrophy, before then moving on to only train strength for multiple \nmonths. One critique of this approach is that during this extended \nperiod of training for only one goal, the adaptations from the previous \nperiods start to degrade. To address this, block periodization uses \nmesocycles for volume and intensity that last typically no longer than \na month and a half. Mesocycle length can be adapted to the number of \ncompetitions that need to be peaked for within a season. Additionally, \na volume block doesn’t necessarily need to be devoid of high-intensity \nwork, it just needs to be higher in volume and lower in intensity relative \nto the intensity block that follows it. In many ways block periodization \nis the same concept as linear periodization, but with a more flexible \napproach to meet the demands of athletes who might need to peak \nmultiple times in a year.\nUndulating periodization is a form of periodization that has more \nfrequent changes in repetition ranges and intensity zones. \nDaily undulating periodization (DUP), is a form of periodization that \nchanges training variables each training session within a week. This can \nPROGRESSION\n129\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nbe performed simply by varying the rep range used on each day, or by \ndesignating different days of the week with different training goals. \nFor example, you might simply do 10’s on day 1, 5’s on day 2, and 8’s on \nday 3, or you might have a “strength day”, a “hypertrophy day” and a \n“power day” all in the same week.\nDUP is just one form of undulating periodization. In fact, you can also \nhave weekly undulating periodization or WUP. In this model, an entire \nweek is dedicated to a specific rep range or training goal. Like block \nperiodization, undulating models of periodization were developed to \navoid the potential pitfall of losing previously attained adaptations \nassociated with linear periodization. The proposed solution in undulating \nperiodization is that each of the training goals (hypertrophy, strength, \nand power) are trained simultaneously in either a day to day (DUP) or \nweek to week (WUP) fashion. Once again, the theoretical advantage is \nthat this approach avoids detraining any one of these adaptations.\nMuch like the linear model, traditional undulating periodization is \nperformed in the order of hypertrophy, strength then power. In \na traditionally designed DUP model, this might mean training for \nhypertrophy on the first session of the week, strength on the second \nsession of the week, and power on the final session of the week (if one \nis using a three day per week training setup). Using a WUP model, you \nwould dedicate a week to each training goal, in that same order over a \nthree week period.\nThese undulating models of periodization are sometimes called nonlinear \nmodels as well, but this is largely an inaccurate description, as most of \nthe time there is a degree of linearity when you look at the big picture \nusage of undulating periodization. For example, a strength athlete may \nalternate between days within the week where they perform 8’s, 6’s, \nand 4’s when they are a couple months out from a meet, but in the final \nweeks might be doing 5’s, 3’s, and 1’s… a DUP model that is linear over \ntime. In fact, these different models share many similar traits and goals \nand arguably should be integrated rather than be seen as separate.\nIntegrating Models Of Periodization\nThere are endless discussions around which model is better, but it’s \nPROGRESSION\n130\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nimportant to point out that they are theoretical and conceptual, not \nhard science. Truly, periodization research has in my opinion, done a \ndisservice to the lifting community in the way that the findings are \npresented [19].\nThere are practically an infinite number of ways that you can set up a \nlinear, block or undulating training program. Thus, each study that might \nshow the superiority of one model over another, cannot truly be said to \nshow definitively that one theory of periodization is superior to another \n[8]. At best, a study can tell you that the specific iteration that was \nstudied was better or worse than what it was compared to. I could easily \ndevise a linear program that would outperform a block program or an \nundulating program that would outperform a linear program, or a block \nprogram that would outperform an undulating program and on and on.\nAsking “Which type of periodization is the best?” is the wrong question. \nIt assumes that these models have a clearly defined universal structure, \nwhich they do not, and it assumes that they are also mutually exclusive, \nwhich they are not either. Programs can have multiple periodization \nelements, and in many cases, this may actually be what works best.\nIn fact, if you were to pick a popular program, in many cases you would \ndiscover upon breaking it down, that it contains elements of more than \none model. For example, if you were to look at one of the versions of \nJim Wendler’s 5/3/1, when the program is used to train and peak for a \npowerlifting meet, you would find that overall, the program’s macrocycle \nfollows a linear periodization approach, in that intensity gradually \nincreases over time, and volume decreases. Also, you’d notice that \nthere are distinct phases of training, much like in block periodization, \nand finally you’d see that each week was dedicated to a specific rep \ntarget, much like WUP. So in reality, a popular program that you might \njust think of as “Beyond 5/3/1” or “5/3/1 for Powerlifting” is actually a \nlinear, block, weekly undulating program when broken down.\nThe take home is that almost every program is linear to some degree. \nAdditionally, very rarely are you doing the same exact rep range every \nday or week, for months on end, so almost every program undulates. \nFinally, if you have phases to your training that last a month or so, you \nhave incorporated a core tenet of block periodization. Fortunately, the \ncutting-edge researchers in the field of periodization are getting away \nPROGRESSION\n131\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nfrom the black and white “which model is best” back and forth that is \narguably counterproductive [20] and have postulated that in fact, an \nintegrated approach is likely superior [5, 17].\nIntegrating Linear Periodization\nIntegrating linearity into a program will pretty much happen \nautomatically if you are following the concepts outlined in this text. \nWhether your goal is to be as big as possible or as strong as possible, \nyou will start regularly testing your strength as described previously in \nthis chapter to gauge progress.\nTo set yourself up to let fatigue dissipate, and to display the fitness \nyou’ve developed in training in order to achieve peak performance \nwhen testing, you’ll be decreasing volume in the period preceding \nyour 1RM or AMRAP testing. Additionally, to follow the principle of \nspecificity, you would be best served to use higher intensity loading \nin the training period leading up to your testing because the testing is \nof course, also high intensity. Doing so will ensure you are prepared to \ndisplay your strength to the best of your ability so you can gauge your \nprogress, and will mean that you are following a linear periodization \nplan to some degree.\nOn a very pragmatic level, let’s say that you are following the \n“Intermediate Trainee Compound Movement Progression” scheme \noutlined earlier, but you also perform that same exercise on two \nother days in the week (following the frequency guidelines outlined \nin the previous chapter), and on each day you follow the intermediate \nprogression scheme with a different rep range. This would be a very \nsimple example of following a linearly periodized, DUP program. If \nyou then organized a phase of training dedicated to higher volume \nusing higher rep ranges, followed by a phase of training using lower \nrep ranges, then tapered and tested, you would be following a linear, \nDUP, block-periodized program.\nSee this example on the next page:\nPROGRESSION\n132\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nPhase 1 Volume\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nWeek 1\n200x3x14\n210x3x9\n225x3x6\nWeek 2\n205x3x12\n215x3x8\n230x3x5\nWeek 3\n210x3x10\n220x3x7\n235x3x4\nWeek 4 \n200x2x10\n210x2x7\n225x2x4\nPhase 2 Intensity\nWeek 5\n210x3x12\n220x3x8\n235x3x5\nWeek 6\n215x3x10\n225x3x7\n240x3x4\nWeek 7\n220x3x8\n230x3x6\n245x3x3\nPhase 3 Taper & Test\nWeek 8\n210x2x8\n220x2x6\n250xAMRAP\n}\n} The intermediate progression is followed, with week 4 being a \ndeload.\n}\n} During phase 1, the 10–14 rep range is utilized on day 1, the 7–9 rep \nrange on day 2, and the 4–6 rep range on day 3.\n}\n} Phase 2 is the same, except it uses the 8–12, 6–8 and 3–5 rep ranges \ninstead.\n}\n} Instead of a deload as is performed in week 4, in phase 3 a taper \nis performed whereby the last day is replaced with an AMRAP to \ngauge progress.\n}\n} Thus, while this is a linear periodized program, it contains elements \nof DUP and block periodization.\nPROGRESSION\n133\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIntegrating Block Periodization\nAs previously stated, this is a form of periodization that divides the \nmacrocycle into 3 different blocks.\nBelow is just one example of how these blocks can be practically applied.\nBlock\nLength\nGoal\nSpecifics\nAccumulation\n6 \nweeks\nWork \ncapacity/ \nHypertrophy\nBuild from 12 to 22 sets. \n2 then 3 sessions/muscle \ngroup or movement weekly \nto accommodate.

This is a phase \nwhere we build a solid foundation by “accumulating” volume. In this \nblock the goal is to build muscle mass and work capacity that allows \nus to handle high-volume training by increasing volume progressively. \nIntensity is kept moderate in this block and the goal is to increase work \ncapacity; our ability to handle and recover from higher levels of volume.\nIn this block you would do the following:\n}\n} Week 1 starts with a 2x/week training frequency, with 12 sets per \nmuscle group/movement split between both sessions (6 sets per \nmuscle group/movement per session).\n}\n} For the next two weeks, increase the training volume by 2 sets/muscle \ngroup or movement/week from 12 in week 1, all the way to 16 in week \n3 (8 sets per muscle group/movement per session in week 3).\n}\n} In week 4, increase training frequency per muscle group/movement \nfrom twice to three times per week, to accommodate another increase \nof 2 sets/muscle group or movement/week such that now you are doing \n6 sets per muscle group/movement per session, over 3 sessions (18 \nsets per muscle group/movement per week divided over 3 sessions).\n}\n} For the next two weeks, keep increasing training volume by 2 sets per \nmuscle group each week, such that in week 5 you are doing 20 sets/\nmuscle group/movement per week, and in week 6 you are doing 22 \n(6–8 sets per muscle group/movement per session in weeks 5 and 6).\n}\n} Over the course of 6 weeks, you have now gone from 12 sets/muscle \ngroup or movement/week to 22.\n}\n} If your goal is strength, utilize the 4–6 rep range for ⅔ of your \nvolume, and the 8–12 rep range for the remaining volume. If your \ngoal is hypertrophy, utilize the 6–12 rep range for ⅔ of your volume, \nand the 12–15 rep range for the remaining volume.\n}\n} Do not train to failure, make sure you have a rep (or reps) left in \nthe tank at the completion of each set to ensure recovery. RPE 5–8 \nshould constitute the majority of this block.\n}\n} Only increase load when it is easy to do so without going near failure.\nPROGRESSION\n135\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIntensification Block (~4 weeks)\nThe next block is known as the “intensification block” (although you \nmay hear it called a “transmutation” block in some sports science \ntexts), whereas the name suggests, we increase the intensity.\nVolume is reduced compared to the previous accumulation block \nand instead of volume, the load is increased progressively. From the \nprevious block, you have both increased your muscle mass and your \nwork capacity. This means that you will recover quite well between \nsessions, and as you adapt to lifting heavier you will be able to push \nheavier loads because you have more muscle mass to recruit. Your \nintensity will approach near maximum towards the end of this block.\n}\n} In weeks 1 and 2, reduce the number of sets per week from 22 to 18 \nper muscle group/movement.\n}\n} In weeks 3 and 4, decrease to 15 sets per muscle group/movement, \nand then to 12 sets per muscle group/movement while attempting \nto increase loads each week.\n}\n} If your goal is strength, utilize the 2–5 rep range for ⅔ of your \nvolume, and the 6–10 rep range for the remaining volume. If your \ngoal is hypertrophy, utilize the 6–10 rep range for ⅔ of your volume, \nand the 3–5 rep range for the remaining volume.\n}\n} Intensity should increase and repetitions decrease over the course \nof the block in a linear fashion. Meaning you’d start with 5’s and \n10’s, and progress your heavy sets down to 2’s and your lighter sets \ndown to 6’s by the end of the block. Relative intensity (RPE) should \napproach near maxes as you do so. By the end of this period, you \nshould be hitting 9’s, 9.5’s, and near 10’s on the RPE scale.\nRealization Block (~2 weeks)\nThe next block is known as the ‘realization block’, where we are able to \n‘realize’ our improved fitness by letting the fatigue dissipate that has \naccumulated over the previous weeks. This is a taper, AKA a deload, \nthus it’s important to reduce volume to let go of fatigue and maintain \nintensity to keep the strength adaptations just acquired.\nPROGRESSION\n136\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} For the first week, taper training volume by reducing sets performed \nper muscle group to 10, maintain the same rep ranges from the last \nblock but reduce proximity to failure slightly (RPE 7–9).\n}\n} If your goal is hypertrophy do AMRAPs on your main lifts spread \nover the course of the week. Only doing the 1 working set AMRAP \non main lifts. For all other exercises, cut the number of sets in half. \nIf your goal is strength, do 1RM testing on the final day on your main \nlifts together. On 2–3 previous training days, work up to a single \non your lifts at a descending RPE starting throughout the week \nfinishing at a 5 RPE, e.g. singles at 7, 6, then 5 RPE on M, W, F before \ntesting on Sunday, or, work up to a single at a 6 then 5 RPE on T, Th, \nbefore testing on Saturday as examples. On all other movements, \ncut sets in half.\nIntegrating Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP)\nIn this example, we’re going to integrate the concept of DUP into \na training plan. Like traditional Western periodization, DUP was \ntraditionally set up with the same order of hypertrophy, strength, then \npower to result in maximal athletic performance. However, for strength \nand physique competitors, it makes a lot more sense to try to peak \nstrength for testing progress, rather than power.\nIn fact, to investigate this very topic, Dr. Mike Zourdos did his Ph.D. \ndissertation on a comparison of two forms of DUP in powerlifters. \nOne group followed the traditional model of hypertrophy, strength, \npower (HSP) and the second group swapped power for strength and \nperformed the goals in the order of hypertrophy, power, strength (HPS).\nTraditional DUP - HSP\n}\n} Day 1: Hypertrophy — moderate intensity/high volume, think 6–12 \nreps at RPE 5–8\n}\n} Day 2: Strength — high intensity/moderate volume, think 1–6 reps \nat RPE 8–10\n}\n} Day 3: Power — moderately-high intensity/low volume, think 1–3 \nreps at RPE 5–7\nPROGRESSION\n137\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe argument against this model is that there will be a lot of muscle \ndamage and fatigue from Day 1’s high volume hypertrophy session, \nwhich could compromise the most important session for the powerlifter \n— the strength session which occurred on Day 2. So he thought of \norganizing things slightly differently:\nModified DUP - HPS\n}\n} Day 1: Hypertrophy\n}\n} Day 2: Power\n}\n} Day 3: Strength\nThe strength session was swapped with the power session. The power \nsession for a powerlifter is essentially just heavy technique work. In his \nstudy, he had the lifters perform single repetitions at a moderate RPE \nof 6–8. This is a low amount of volume, a chance to get practice with a \ndecently heavy load but not so draining that you won’t always be able \nto complete the reps (even when suffering soreness and fatigue from \nDay 1), and this would allow for additional recovery before the most \nimportant final session, strength.\nIn his study, on the strength day he had the participants perform \nAMRAP’s with 85% of 1RM. Interestingly, he found with the HPS modified \nprotocol, the lifters gained more strength and this was likely due to \ntheir ability to perform more volume on their strength day AMRAPs \n[17], presumably due to greater recovery.\nSo, the point is that even within the same model of periodization, there \nare variations which can substantially change the outcome. Additionally, \nit’s worth pointing out that there was a linear periodized progression \nin Dr. Z’s study! So once again, don’t think in black and white when \nconsidering periodization.\nExample Approach Using Modified DUP\nHere is an example way of implementing DUP for a powerlifter.\n}\n} Training is done on four days per week. Your three, weekly off days \ncan occur when desired to break up the four days, but I would advise \nPROGRESSION\n138\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nafter days 1, 3 and 4 as they will be the most taxing.\n}\n} The bench press and squat are performed three days per week \nwhile the deadlift is only performed twice.\n}} The deadlift isn’t performed with a hypertrophy focus, so it doesn’t occur \non day 1. Since in the deadlift the eccentric portion is normally rushed \nand uncontrolled (which is fine if you are a powerlifter but not great for \nhypertrophy), the squat and accessory movements are intended to get \nmore volume on the associated musculature of the deadlift.\n}\n} To prevent excessive fatigue on any given day, bench and squat \nstrength sessions occur together, then on a separate day (ideally \nwith a day off between), the deadlift strength session is performed.\n}\n} The amount of accessory work done is scaled to the goal of the day. \nOn day 1 where we are accumulating a lot of fatigue and doing a lot \nof work, it is high. On day 2 where we are doing heavy technique \nwork and recovering from day 1, it is low. Then on our strength days, \nit is moderate.\nExercise\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nDay 4\nSquat\nHypertrophy\nPower\nStrength\nOff\nBench\nHypertrophy\nvv\nStrength\nOff\nDeadlift\nOff\nPower\nOff\nStrength\nAccessories\nHigh Volume Low Volume\nModerate \nVolume\nModerate \nVolume\nWhen training a lift for hypertrophy, use moderate intensity and high \nvolume. The key here is to get the necessary volume in. 6–12 reps at \nan RPE 5–8 is a good range for this. A good chunk of your weekly sets \nPROGRESSION\n139\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nshould be done here, especially in a volume block (if integrating this \nwith other periodization models, as you should). For example, if you \nare doing 12 sets of bench press per week, you might do 5 on Day 1, 3 \non Day 2 and 4 on Day 3. \nWhen training a lift for power, perform semi-heavy singles, doubles \nand triples. This is our technique day where we practice heavy lifting. \n1–3 reps per set at 75–90% of 1RM is a good target (RPE 5–7). This day \nwill be moderate intensity, low volume. No more than 3–5 sets per main \nlift on these days. The goal is recovery overall. These sets will build \nthe skill and neuromuscular qualities of strength, and also facilitate \nrecovery from the fatigue on Day 1, but will do little to build muscle \nmass. Thus, the volume on power days should be low in most phases, \nbut might be a little higher in an intensity block (although total volume \nfor the whole block would be lower) vs. a volume block (if integrating \nthis with other periodization models, which again, you should).\nWhen training a lift for strength, use high intensity and moderate \nvolume. 1–6 reps at a 7–9 RPE is a good range, with multiple sets used to \nachieve the target volume. If you integrated this DUP setup with block \nperiodization (which as you guessed I would say, you should), you would \ndo more sets on this day in an intensity block, and less during a volume \nblock. Also, in the portion of a block where it’s time to test strength, use \nthis day for 1RM or AMRAP testing. For example, if you integrated this \nDUP microcycle into a block, you could linearly periodize these strength \ndays to go from sets of 4 in week 1, to sets of 3 in week 2, to sets of 2 in \nweek 3, to then a 1RM test in week 4. This is similar to what was outlined \npreviously for intermediates, or you can run through this cycle in longer \nblocks and test every 6–12 weeks after a taper.\nOn the note of tapers, let’s get more into the details of that…\nTapering For Competition\nWe’ve talked a lot about the realization phase of block periodization \nwithout specifically explaining tapers in detail.\nTapering is a strategy commonly used by not only strength athletes such \nas powerlifters and weightlifters, but also by athletes in sports like triathlon, \ntrack and field, and endurance events that have a single-day competition.\nPROGRESSION\n140\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nTapering means to reduce training volume in order to let fatigue go down \nand express your full potential (fitness) in the form of performance. \nTapering is similar to a deload but differs in the purpose:\n}\n} The purpose of the deload is usually to reduce fatigue so that \nprogress can continue.\n}\n} The purpose of tapering is to allow us to be at our best condition \nfor competition day, a process known as ‘peaking’.\nTapering Can Be Done As Follows:\n}\n} Roughly 1–4 weeks out, begin tapering to decrease accumulated \nfatigue. The length of the taper should be proportionate to the time \nspent overloading and the amount of fatigue you incurred.\n}\n} Reduce volume during the taper by ⅓, up to ⅔.\n}\n} Maintain or slightly decrease intensity (no more than 10% reduction). \nOr if you are using a longer taper (3–4 weeks) it can slightly increase \nas a part of the linear periodized progression with volume decreases.\n}\n} In the immediate days before the competition, this reduction \nin volume can also be done by taking 1–3 days off of training \nimmediately prior to competition.\n}\n} However, there is data showing that a light “primer session” may \nimprove performance for 24–48 hours [21]. So it may make sense \nto have a very low volume, low RPE session 1–2 days before the \ncompetition. For example, working up to a 4–5 RPE single on the \nbig 3 and nothing else. \nThe above tenets are based on research as to what is the most effective \nmethod for tapering to allow expression of maximal strength [3].\nA very simple method of tapering that can be applied to most \npowerlifting programs at two weeks out is as follows:\n}\n} At 2 weeks out, begin including some days where you train all three \nlifts, in order (if you aren’t already). Use low reps (1–3), but similar \npercentages of 1RM as you might use on sets of 4–6 (75-85%). This \nwill maintain the intensity of load, but keep RPE low for recovery. \nPROGRESSION\n141\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nAdditionally, the increased frequency of main lift training by doing \nall three lifts together will not only increase specificity prior to the \nmeet, but also prevent the volume from falling too excessively from \nthis repetition decrease.\n}\n} Perform fewer total sets as needed to reduce weekly main lift \nvolume by 50–70%.\n}\n} Continue to perform accessory work 2 weeks out, but only do half \nas many sets.\n}\n} Conclude your 2 weeks out microcycle with opener practice. That is, \nwork up to your proposed openers on the big 3, the Saturday before \nyour meet (7 days out). These should be singles at a 7.5–8.5 RPE.\n}\n} The week of the meet, start the week the same way as 2 weeks out \nbegan, but also perform the second to last day of training 1–2 days \nbefore you compete, and work up to a single on the big 3 at a 4–5 \nRPE and do nothing else, as a primer. Additionally, the last day of \ntraining of the week isn’t performed. Instead, you compete!\nFinally, don’t forget how important attempt selection is. A great training \nplan and taper can be ruined by poor attempt selection on meet day. Be \nsmart, build the biggest total you can rather than focusing on individual \nlift personal bests. A good strategy that sets you up for success, is to \nopen with your current 3RM, do your current 2RM as a second attempt, \nand then go for the next incremental personal record if it’s there on \nyour third attempt. If it’s probably not there, make a conservative jump \nto get what you can on that day. \nThe next incremental personal best is a 2.5 kg increase in most \nfederations, which might not seem like much. But, if you compete two \nto three times per year, and you go up 2.5 kg on all three lifts, you’re \nadding 15 to 22.5 kg (33 to 50 lb) to your competition total each year! \nThe only time I’d recommend being more aggressive is if you’ve made \nsuch massive gains since your last competition (common in novices) \nthat you are regularly doing more than your old 1RM for reps in training.\nFor competitive bodybuilders, peaking for a competition is about \nappearance and is therefore related more to nutrition than training. In \nfact, as a bodybuilder in your final week what you do with your training \nPROGRESSION\n142\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nhas nothing to do with reducing fatigue to allow strength to peak —\ntapering in the traditional sense is only used to test strength periodically \nthroughout the year. For competition, the goal is to peak performance \nand that means adjusting training to help your carbohydrate load.\nThus, you want to challenge the glycolytic energy system (using \nglycogen as fuel) in the final week to encourage more glycogen storage \n(carbs in the muscle). So a simple way to do this is as follows:\n}\n} Keep your exercises, split, and number of sets the same but perform \n8–20 reps on all training days the week of your competition. \n}\n} However, keep RPE at 6–8.5, avoid performing movements that \ncause soreness (new movements or those with heavy eccentrics at \nlong muscle lengths, like RDLs), and typically aim to finish your split \ntwo to three days out. \n}\n} On the final one to two days before competition, you can do a full \nbody pump up routine similar to what you would do the day of \ncompetition, but RPE should reach no higher than 6 and this should \nonly take 30 minutes. \nFor more details, especially on the nutritional side of peaking, make \nsure to check out the Muscle and Strength Nutrition Pyramid book!\nSummary\nSetting up your volume, intensity and frequency is just the structure of \nthe overall plan, but periodization and progression are how that plan \nchanges and adapts over time. The VIF guidelines from Level 2 will \nget you in the ballpark, but how you adjust these variables over micro, \nmeso and macrocycles are how you hit home runs.\nMake sure to only use as advanced an approach as is appropriate for \nyour training age, and once you get to the intermediate and eventually \nthe advanced stage, be sure to avoid black and white thinking. Use \nthe examples in this chapter of how you can integrate and combine \nconcepts in order to set up a plan for progression that will enable you \nto fully realize your potential.\nPROGRESSION\n143\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nReferences\n1.

The inclusion of these competition lifts, therefore, is a \ngiven. Thus, the focus of a discussion on exercise selection for a strength \nathlete should be centered on how much time is spent training the \ncompetition lifts in relation to assistance lifts.\nFor hypertrophy, a wide variety of exercises can be used to stimulate \ngrowth. That being said, based on the biomechanics of the individual, \nsome exercises may be more effective than others. This is also a \nrelevant consideration for a strength athlete. For example, even though \na powerlifter may have to squat, in some cases the squat may not \nproduce balanced development if that specific powerlifter is not well \nbuilt to squat. Therefore, they might be better suited to doing more \nassistance work for leg development rather than more squats compared \nto someone who had limb and torso lengths well suited to squatting.\nPhysique-sport competitors must also consider not only what exercises \nbest suit their body’s lever lengths, but also how to modify their exercise \nselection to address weak points in their physique. Biomechanics, \nweak points, and technical skill can all influence what exercises you \nchoose to use. However, in a broad sense exercise selection is primarily \ndifferentiated based on the goal of your training—whether you’re \ntraining for hypertrophy like a bodybuilder or training for strength like \na powerlifter.\nTo begin, we will start with a summary of the recommendations and \nthen dive into the rationale afterward.\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n147\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\nExercise Selection Guidelines\nStrength\n(Powerlifter)\nCompetition lifts for 50–75% of the total volume.\nAccessory work for 25–50%\nHypertrophy\n(Bodybuilder)\n1–2 compound exercises for each major muscle \ngroup.\n1–3 isolation exercises for each muscle group.\nHypertrophy: Exercises and Muscle Groups Trained\nMovement Pattern\nPrimary Muscle \nGroups\nSecondary Muscle \nGroups\nSquat (all variations, \nleg press, single leg \nvariants)\nQuads, Glutes\nErectors (if free \nweights)\nHip Hinge (deadlift \nvariations, good \nmorning, back ext)\nGlutes, Hams, \nErectors\nScapular Retractors\nVertical Pull \n(chins, lat pull)\nLats, Bis\nRear Delts\nVertical Push \n(OHP variations)\nAnterior Delts, Tris\nMiddle Delts\nHorizontal Pull \n(row variations)\nLats, Scapular \nRetractors\nRear Delts, Bis, Middle \nDelts\nHorizontal Push \n(flat, incline, decline \npushing variants)\nChest, Anterior Delts\nTris (CG/dips: \nprimary), Middle Delts \n(incline)\nHorizontal Hip \nExtension (hip thrust, \nglute bridge etc)\nGlutes\nHams\nPull Over \n(DB pullover, lat \npushdown, BB \npullover etc)\nLats\nTris, Chest\nFly (cable crossover, \nDB flys)\nChest\nAnterior Delts\nIsolation Exercises\nTarget muscle\nN/A\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n148\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nStrength: Exercises and Movement/Muscle Group Categories\nMovement/Muscle Group \nCategories\nExercises\nUpper Body Push\nBench and variants (CGBP, board press \netc.), horizontal and vertical pushing, \ntriceps work\nUpper Body Pull\nDeadlift and variants (RDL, pause \ndeadlift etc.), horizontal and vertical \npulling\nLower Body\nDeadlift, squat and variants (front squat, \nsafety bar squat etc.), all lower body \naccessories\nSpecificity\nSpecific Gains In Specific Movements\nWhen speaking in terms of basic exercise selection, the most efficient \nroute to getting stronger in a specific movement is to train that specific \nmovement [1–4].\nSimply put, when you do a lot of squats, you will improve your skill with \nthe squat, develop the specific muscle groups that are activated during \nthe squat, and the strength that you gain will be best expressed in the \nsquat itself. In contrast, even if you have developed a lot of muscle mass \nin the quads, glutes and hamstrings from leg pressing for example, if you \nare not experienced in the squat, and not used to its motor pattern, you \nwill not be able to exert the same force you could when leg pressing as \nwhen squatting. This, in essence, is what movement specificity means.\nAs mentioned in the Intensity section, specificity also applies to intensity. \nIf you only train with 10RM loads, your strength gains (measured by \n1RM testing) will be less than someone who regularly trains with the \nsame volume, but using 3RM loads [5]. This is because a 3RM is more \nsimilar from a neuromuscular perspective to a 1RM than a 10RM.\nSo as you can see, specificity applies to many aspects of training. In \nthe case of powerlifting, a sport of competing with 1RMs on the squat, \nbench and deadlift, it’s essential to develop a high level of skill with \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n149\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthe motor patterns of these exercises and to also train the ability to lift \nheavy. That doesn’t necessarily mean you only train the competition \nlifts, but for optimal results, they should be a large focus of training.\nYour primary movements if training for strength should be the \nmovements that you want to get stronger in.\nFor hypertrophy, it’s a little bit different.\nUnfamiliar Movements Are Less Effective For Inducing \nHypertrophy\nIn the world of bodybuilding, it is often advised that you have to swap out \nexercises frequently so that you will continue to adapt and grow from \ntraining. This is often referred to as “muscle confusion” and sometimes \ntouted as an important principle of training. But in fact in some ways, \nquite the opposite is true — hypertrophy is not as effectively gained \nwhen you’re not familiar with the movement.\nBack in 1998, a study was conducted where the participants performed the \nbench press, leg press, and bicep curls for 20 weeks. At the midpoint and \nendpoint of the study, measurements of hypertrophy and strength (1RM) \nwere taken. Increases in muscle mass in the arms were significant at the \nmidpoint as were increases in strength. But interestingly enough, muscle \ngrowth in the trunk and the legs was not yet observed. However, at the 20-\nweek mark, hypertrophy in the limbs and trunk finally became apparent.\nWhy was there a delay in muscle growth in the trunk and legs and not \nthe arms?\nWell, the researchers concluded that movements with a low complexity \nsuch as the bicep curl are quickly learned, while the time needed to \nbecome proficient in compound movements is longer. Additionally, \nonly once you become proficient with a movement are you able to \neffectively overload the movement to cause muscle growth. \nTherefore, the easy to learn bicep curl was mastered quickly and began \nto cause adequate overload to cause growth, while there was a delayed \neffect from the leg press and bench press [6].\nInitial strength gains on new exercises, especially complex ones, are \nprimarily (but not exclusively) due to neuromuscular adaptations [7]. \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n150\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nOnce the movement skill is developed over time, the lifter can expose the \nmuscle to progressive overload and more efficiently produce hypertrophy \n[8]. Thus, even if your goal is purely hypertrophy, you want to become an \nexpert in the movements that you use to drive muscle growth. So it can \nbe counterproductive to set up your training in such a way that you are \nnever able to become skilled at your movements of choice [9].\nNow, does this mean that we shouldn’t ever change up our exercises \nand there isn’t value in it?\nNo, in fact, exercise variety is important for optimizing hypertrophy. \nHowever, ensuring adequate variety is not the same as the concept \nof “muscle confusion”. So, how much variety is appropriate? We’ll talk \nabout this next.\nA Degree Of Variety Can Be Important\nAs much as we don’t want to have too large a range of exercises in a \ntraining program, or to change things up too frequently, we also don’t \nwant to have a rigid adherence to a single movement. In fact, this is \ntrue even if your goal is strength.\nLike was stated at the beginning of this chapter, for pure strength athletes \n50–75% of your volume should come from the specific movements you \nare trying to get stronger in.\nThe rationale for why your exercise selection should not solely consist of \nthe single exercise you are trying to improve is encapsulated in a 2014 study \nthat compared a few groups performing resistance training of differing \nexercise selections. Some of the groups did just the Smith machine squat, \nand some other groups did the Smith machine squat in conjunction with \nthe leg press, deadlift and lunges. Both groups did the same total number \nof reps and sets, just spread over one movement, or over four.\nAfter reading my previous section on specificity, you might expect that \nthe groups doing only the Smith machine squat would have gotten \nthe strongest on that movement, but in fact, you’d be incorrect. When \ncomparing the changes in their 1RM strength in the Smith machine \nsquat, the researchers found that the group that did the four exercises \nmade more strength gains than the group that did the Smith machine \nsquat only [10].\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n151\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nSo why is it that doing more volume with the one movement was inferior \nto using multiple different exercises?\nLet’s think about it like this:\nA compound movement is the combination of a bunch of different \njoints and muscles coordinated together. However, that compound \nmovement may not necessarily be the most efficient way to train each \none of those single muscle groups. Think of a chain being pulled until it \nsnaps - it will do so at the weakest link, right? Similarly, if there is a weak \nlink in all of the muscles contributing to a movement, that muscle can \npotentially limit strength. So perhaps by performing some accessory \nwork with other movements, one can ensure more balanced growth \nin muscles that would otherwise be limiting factors. This is important \nfrom both strength and hypertrophy standpoints.\nNow, it’s also important to point out that this study had some limitations. \nThe same outcome may not have occurred with the free-weight barbell \nsquat. A Smith machine squat is a complex, multi-joint movement, \nbut it’s not as complex as the free-weight squat in which the bar can \ntraverse forwards and backwards—there’s less ability to screw up a \nSmith machine squat. The complexity of a free-weight squat is higher, \nand it is not an unreasonable notion that perhaps more time spent \ndoing free-weight barbell squats would have been more beneficial \nfrom a motor learning perspective.\nAlso, the overall magnitude of hypertrophy, whether doing the four \nexercises or the one, was the same. However, they found more uniform \ngrowth in all four heads of the quadriceps in the group that did the \nfour movements. While this could simply be due to statistical analysis \n(values only reaching significance in certain heads), it also could be \ninterpreted that if you do a specific movement you will get specific \nhypertrophy. If your goal is to get uniform, symmetrical development, \nyou want to have more variety in your movements.\nThis may sound similar to the arguments that one needs specific \nmovements to “shape muscle” or “peak the biceps”. But in actuality, \nthe notion that one can shape muscles or target specific regions of \nmuscle like the “inner chest” is contrary to basic anatomy. However, it is \ntrue that muscle is often compartmentalized [11]. An example would be \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n152\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthe four heads of the quadriceps which have varying attachments and \nmuscle actions depending on the head in question. Another example is \nthe clavicular head of the pec, which has different attachments than the \nsternal head. Furthermore, these different compartments of muscles \nare preferentially activated based on joint position and angle [12].\nFor this reason, some researchers have recommended the use of more \nexercise variety for those wishing to maximize hypertrophy relative \nto those training for general fitness or strength [13, 14]. However, one \nmust be cautious with how this recommendation is interpreted and how \nfrequently exercises are rotated in and out of use, so as to avoid delaying \nskill development. Thus, if your explicit goal is hypertrophy, a practical \nrecommendation is to choose 1–2 compound and 1–3 isolation movements \nfor each muscle group. The compound movements should primarily \nremain static throughout your training phases. Meaning, they should be \nincluded in some capacity at all times, while isolation movements due to \ntheir low complexity, can be rotated more frequently if desired [9].\nAutoregulated Exercise Selection\nOn the topic of rotating exercises more frequently, a 2017 study \ncompared trained lifters who had to use a fixed combination of three \nexercises for a given muscle group paired with a specific loading zone \n(e.g. squat, bench press, etc. @6–8RM, leg press, incline DB press, etc. \n@12–14RM, and leg extension, cable fly, etc. @18–20RM) to a group that \ngot to choose what exercise they wanted to perform for each session, \nwith each loading zone. Interestingly, the autoregulated exercise \nselection group made more upper-body strength gains and gained \nmore lean mass than the group with a fixed selection [15]. \nWhat this tells us, is that trained lifters have some insight into which \nmovements are best suited for their body, seem to work best when \npaired with specific rep ranges, and most importantly it tells us that \nfor hypertrophy purposes, it’s okay to switch things up within reason. \nBut what is reasonable? Well, the lifters in the autoregulated group still \ntrained each movement 4–14 times over the 9-week study. Meaning, \nthey didn’t switch it up so often as to lose movement proficiency, \nand a large part of why they probably gained more lean mass was \nbecause they selected compound exercises more often, and isolation \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n153\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmovements less often, resulting in probably more volume, frequency \nand stimulus per muscle group than the fixed order group. \nHow does this translate to you? Well, for hypertrophy goals, your main \ncompound lifts which you use to gauge progress (at the very least a \nupper-body push, upper-body pull, squat and hinge pattern) should \nremain in your program for the length of multiple mesocycles, up to \na full macrocycle, but isolation movements can be rotated workout \nto workout or mesocycle to mesocycle. For the goal of strength, you \ncan basically apply the same principle to all non-main lift movements \n(squat, bench and deadlift patterns). \nEfficiency: Compound vs. Isolation\nNow that we have established some guidelines for how many exercises to \nperform based on your primary goal, and how often they can be rotated, \nthe question becomes how do you actually decide which exercises to do?\nWith exercises that involve multiple joints, you can train more muscles \nat the same time, accumulating volume for multiple muscle groups \nsimultaneously. Thus, it is efficient to include compound exercises at \nthe core of our programs. Additionally, compound barbell exercises \nallow you to use heavier loads, which is important so that you can track \nsmall relative changes in strength over time to measure progress as we \ndiscussed in the previous chapter.\nHowever, recall that the 2014 study showed that training with Smith \nmachine squats exclusively, led to uneven growth in the quads (or \nperhaps just less growth and this only showed up statistically for a few \nheads of the quad). Thus, for those focused on maximizing proportional \nmuscular development as their primary goal, it would be a smart idea \nto ensure a broader exercise selection for balanced development. To \ndo this, it is probably a smart idea to include the use of accessory/\nisolation exercises in addition to the main compound exercises.\nWhen Training For Strength\nUse the compound exercises that you want to be stronger on at the core \nof your program, e.g. the big 3 in the case of a powerlifter. You should \ndecide your accessory work based on how the accessory exercises \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n154\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmight contribute to improving your main compound exercises. Recall \nthe analogy of the chain breaking at the weakest link — the bench \npress, the deadlift, and the squat are not always necessarily the best \ntools to cause muscle growth in each of the muscles that contribute \nto these movements. Thus, depending on individual needs, other lifts \nshould be included to “assist” the competition lifts.\nWhen Training For Hypertrophy\nWhile it is important that you are familiar with the motor patterns of \nyour main compound lifts, you don’t need to be as much of a specialist \nas a powerlifter. In fact, it might be suboptimal for total body muscular \ndevelopment to only focus on 3 main compound barbell lifts. However, \nfor beginners, their priority is to become proficient with the main lifts \nas quickly as possible. So for novice bodybuilders or those just starting \nwho have the primary goal of muscle gain, remember you will grow with \nsubstantially less volume per muscle group than a more experienced \nlifter. That means, at the novice stage you don’t need to worry much \nabout ensuring isolation movements are included to a large extent. \nNovices will achieve global hypertrophy without much emphasis on \nisolation exercises and their time is better spent learning the basic skills \nof lifting. However, as you get more advanced it becomes important \nto add in accessory work according to your weaknesses to ensure \nbalanced muscular development.\nWeak Points\n‘Weak points’ can refer to a specific strength deficiency in the muscle \ngroups contributing to a lift, or a specific muscle group’s lack of \ndevelopment from an aesthetic standpoint. There is a place for isolation/\nassistance movements to assist in these cases.\nHypertrophy\nFirst let’s talk about this from a hypertrophy perspective, where a weak \npoint is generally an area lacking muscular development. \nOften, a weak point simply stems from the way you are built genetically. \nYou might have a narrow rib cage and wide hips, and thus you need \nto focus your efforts on getting hypertrophy in your shoulders and \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n155\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nquads to offset the “narrow” look to your physique to get an “x-frame” \nappearance. For the most part, there is not much you can do outside of \njust getting as big as possible to offset structural weak points. It’s also \nimportant to point out that from a muscular development standpoint, \nyou might not actually have a weak point. For example, you might \nhave big delts and lats, but narrow shoulders, making you look narrow \nregardless of the fact that you have good development. \nHowever, sometimes weak points develop for other reasons. In some \ncases, you may not be structurally suited to a certain movement \nand emphasizing it might not be a good idea from an injury risk or \nhypertrophy standpoint. For example, if you have extremely long femurs \n(thigh bones) relative to the length of your torso, you will have to lean \nvery far forward to keep the load of the barbell positioned over your \nmidfoot (your center of gravity) during a back squat. This means that \nthere will be less knee flexion, and more hip flexion relative to someone \nwho can perform the squat in a more upright position. Therefore, the \nknee extensors (the quads) won’t be as effectively stressed as the hip \nextensors (the lumbar, hips, and hamstrings). Additionally, the stress \non your lower back will be higher. In this case, while the squat would \neffectively develop your posterior chain, it might not be the best \nchoice for posterior chain development if it causes lumbar pain and \nit certainly wouldn’t be a good choice for quad development. So even \nthough the back squat is often considered the “best exercise” for leg \ndevelopment, some people might be better off using the leg press or \ndoing front squats complemented by exercises to train the posterior \nchain like a Romanian deadlift or other deadlift variants.\nWeak points in a physique also frequently arise from issues with how \nexercises are performed. Doing rows and pulldowns, for example, you \nmay find that certain parts of your back just don’t seem to get as much \ngrowth as others, or your biceps may take over. You may find that \ndoing pressing you get a lot of growth in your triceps and delts, but \nnot your pecs (or you just don’t feel them very well). You may have to \nmodify grip position, angle, and choose variations of an exercise to find \nwhat gives you uniform growth.\nAs a personal example, when I first started doing rows, lat pulldowns, \nand other back work I had a tough time feeling the main compartment \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n156\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nof my back—the latissimus dorsi. This is the muscle that spans broadly \nacross the back from the lumbar to the mid back and then fans out \nattaching at the top of the upper arm near the armpit.\nI found that when I trained my back I got a lot of teres major activation \n(the muscle right underneath the armpit on your back that assists the \nlats) during pulldowns, and I was only getting mid-back activation \nfrom my rows. Also, I got a lot of bicep activation from both rows and \npulldowns. I ended up developing good arms, mid back and rear delts \nand essentially more of a ‘t-taper’ instead of the ‘v-taper’ that we’re \nafter as bodybuilders. To get more growth in my lats, I had to do some \nspecific things to alter my approach to rows and lat pulldowns. During \nexperimentation, I found that pulling towards my waist with rows helped \nengage my lats, and using straps or a thumbless grip helped to get \nless bicep activation. Doing this as well as actively thinking about the \nmovement of my ribcage and scapulae helped me to get more uniform \nmuscular activation. Once I was able to effectively perform these \nexercises in a balanced way, I was able to get much more complete \nback development (by the way, these aren’t recommendations for how \nto train your back, just what helped me, this will be individual).\nProper form is critical to effective training. In fact, there is research to \nshow that when novices are given expert instruction on how to perform \nlat pulldowns they are able to get better muscular activation in the \nlatissimus dorsi [16]. The take home is that on compound movements \nthat involve multiple muscle groups that all work together to perform \nthe same joint actions, it is not uncommon to struggle with uniform \nactivation and to have one muscle group unevenly perform and to \nsubsequently get unbalanced muscular development.\nThus, proper form is of paramount importance when attempting to build a \nbalanced physique. While I can only teach theory and programming here, \nand I can’t teach you to lift, I would highly recommend the 3DMJ Lifting \nLibrary where I do just that. It’s an excellent companion to this text.\nStrength\nA powerlifter may have a “weak link in the chain” of a lift. For example, \nyou may be able to pull more with straps than you can with just chalk. \nThis is a great indication that your grip strength is what is holding back \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n157\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nyour deadlift.\nWhile some might argue that the most specific way to develop grip \nstrength in the deadlift is to simply deadlift more frequently or with \nmore volume, this logically falls flat. If doing deadlifts was the simple \nsolution to lagging grip strength for someone performing deadlifts, the \nissue likely wouldn’t have surfaced in the first place. This is not to say \nthat doing more deadlifts would not strengthen the grip. It certainly \nwould. But perhaps not in proportion to the potential strength of the \nother muscle groups, or in the most time efficient manner possible. \nSo for a powerlifter in this predicament, he or she might find that a much \nmore direct way to get stronger in the deadlift would be to directly \nattack the weak link with specific grip strength training. For example, \nthe lifter might do a partial deadlift from the rack nearly at lockout with \na high percentage of their 1RM, and hold the loaded barbell for time. \nThen, over subsequent training cycles slowly progress the time and the \nload until the grip strength deficiency is resolved.\nBut again, this is just one of many potential reasons a powerlifter might \nneed to emphasize non-competition lifts. To use a previous example, \nlet’s revisit the back squat. Consider a powerlifter, who like our previous \nbodybuilder example, has to perform a squat with a great deal of forward \nlean to keep the bar over their center of gravity due to his or her limb \nlengths and torso length. To make matters worse, it’s very likely that \nthis powerlifter is a low-bar squatter, meaning the bar is placed across \nthe lower traps and supported by the rear delts, versus the bar being \nplaced across the top of the traps in the case of a high-bar squat. \nLow-bar squats are often performed by powerlifters to keep the \nload closer to the center of gravity to give the lifter a biomechanical \nadvantage. In this case, all of the issues the bodybuilder experienced \nwith the back squat would occur, but to a greater extent. However, \nthe powerlifter does not have an option to choose another exercise \nbecause the squat is a competition lift that must be performed. Like \nthe bodybuilder, the powerlifter might not get great quad development \nfrom squats, and if the vast majority of their lower body training only \ncomes from low-bar squats and deadlifts, they will have great posterior \nchain development but relatively poor quad development.\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n158\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nNow, the quads definitely contribute to this hypothetical lifter’s low-\nbar squat, it’s just that they aren’t worked through a very full range \nof motion due to there not being a lot of movement around the knee \n(compared to a more upright squat). So in this lifter’s case, much like \nthe bodybuilder, it might be a good idea to perform front squats or \neven a leg press to attempt to get more quadriceps development. That \nsaid, the back squat is still performed frequently and emphasized as it \nis the competition lift and this skill must be developed. But it is just that \nthe volume should be lower to avoid injury and accessory training is \nemphasized as well so that hopefully when the squat is performed, more \nweight can be lifted because the quads are better able to contribute.\nMany other situations can be thought of which might require a pure \nstrength athlete to emphasize non-competition lifts. Let’s take the \nbench press for example. Let’s say that doing a high frequency and \nvolume of the bench press causes you elbow and shoulder pain; \nhowever, if you limit the frequency and volume of your bench press you \nmake slower progress or even stall. In this case, instead of throwing \nup your hands in frustration or frequently injuring yourself stubbornly \ndoing a high volume of benching, it might be prudent to only perform \nthe frequency and volume you can get away with on the bench press \nwhile avoiding elbow and shoulder pain. Then, accepting that you can’t \nperform the requisite volume with the bench press, you perform more \nvolume with a close-grip bench press, military press, or dumbbell press \nin an attempt to get the best results possible for your situation.\nNow, these are just examples, but I could give hundreds more. There is a \nhuge amount of variation between individuals in terms of height, torso \nlength, limb length, upper to lower limb length ratios, limb length to \nheight ratios, and limb to torso length ratios. There are also situations \nwhere injury or pain prevention might require you to make certain \ndecisions to use movements outside of the big three to a greater \ndegree. Due to these individual differences, and based on the phase \nof your periodized plan, the volume dedicated to accessory work can \nfluctuate between 25 to 50% of your total training volume.\nMovement Weak Points and “Sticking Regions”\nUp to this point I’ve addressed weak points mostly from a musculature \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n159\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nperspective, and with a nod to limb lengths. However, there are schools \nof thought that focus more on the output; weaknesses in portions of \nthe movement itself.\nCommon in powerlifting circles, often a “sticking point” or region is \ntargeted in one manner or another either with pausing at or around these \npoints, by using specific variations of the big three that are thought to \ntrain that point differently, or by using variable AKA ‘accommodating \nresistance’ (e.g. bands and chains—more on this in a moment) to change \nwhere the weak point of a lift is. Some of these approaches have merit, \nwhile others operate under flawed assumptions. \nThe tactic of using a pause at a given point in a lift can be effective, \ndepending on how it is performed. For example, if you “stick” at a given \npoint in the range of motion of a lift, does it make sense to pause at \nthat point in training? I’ve heard it argued that this allows more time \nspent exerting force at the point you are weakest. However, that doesn’t \nmake sense if you think about it for two reasons:\n1.\t\nIntentionally pausing at a point in your range of motion requires\nyou to reduce the force output at that point, so that the bar stops\nmoving. Do you want to train to exert less force at your sticking\npoint? Probably not.\n2.\t\nThe visible portion of the range of motion where the bar sticks\nis after where you could no longer generate enough force to\nmaintain bar velocity. When you hit the brakes in your car, you\nscreech to a halt in front of where you tried to stop. So, are you\neven pausing at your sticking point at all?\nHowever, \nthis \ndoesn’t \nmean \npausing \nis \nalways \nuseless, \nor \ncounterproductive. Slowing down a portion of a lift gives you more \ntime to be aware of what your body is doing and the position of the bar \nrelative to you at that point. Done intentionally and prescribed logically, \npauses can make sense. \nThere is nothing wrong with pausing below the knee on a deadlift, for \nexample. If you often let the bar drift out in front of you, pausing here \nmight teach you to keep the bar close. This approach may be a useful \nway to ingrain a better movement pattern by breaking the lift into \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n160\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n“chunks” that are more manageable from a motor learning perspective. \nLikewise, if you lose tightness as you come out of the hole on squats \nand struggle to control the ‘bounce’, pausing in the hole allows elastic \nenergy to dissipate and gives you time to pay attention to, and focus \non generating tightness. Doing pause squats may allow you to better \ncontrol the transition from eccentric to concentric when you go back \nto regular squats. \nAs a final example, as you get closer to competition, you might decide \nto do longer pauses on your chest before pressing the bar up when \nbenching. Given you aren’t always sure how long you’ll have to wait for \na press command in competition, getting better at generating force \nfrom a dead stop may help you on comp day. \nAlso, don’t get me wrong, there is merit to the idea of training to exert \nmore force at a given portion of a range of motion where you are weaker. \nAs I discussed in Level 2, strength is specific in many ways, including at \nspecific joint angles. While pausing in the middle of a dynamic repetition \nwon’t address this deficiency for the reasons I gave above, there are \nsome approaches which might help address such weak points [17].\nIsometric (pressing against an immovable object) training at the point \nin a range of motion where you are weak may be a potential way to \nget stronger at a sticking point. However, the problem remains that \nexactly where you are weak, versus the visible point where momentum \nstopped carrying you through the sticking point, is hard to discern. (To \nbe exact it would require lab equipment or at least video analysis.)\nAnother cause of sticking points in certain lifters is when a technical \nfault predictably occurs near maximum. Some lifters perfectly execute \nsquats at 90% of 1RM and lower but perform “squat mornings” (the \nhips shoot up out of concert with the torso, back tightness is lost and \nit slightly resembles a good morning) when going heavier. \nAnother common technical fault at maximal loads is when the normally \nrigid thoracic (and sometimes lumbar) spine moves into flexion during \ndeadlifts. These faults (and others) can prompt or exacerbate a sticking \npoint. Likewise, it is certainly reasonable to use variations on the main \nlifts which “punish” these movement faults and “reward” when they \nare avoided (as my friend Mike Tuchscherer would say). For example, \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n161\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\na front squat will be almost immediately dumped forward and lost if \nyour hips shoot up and you lose back tightness. Maintaining a proper \nrack position requires intentional focus and provides an anti-flexion \nchallenge to the back extensors. Other such exercises that highlight \nwhen you make an error can be used in similar scenarios for other \ntechnical faults that might lead to a sticking point. \nFinally, variable or accommodating resistance is commonly used to \naddress sticking points. By adding chains to a barbell, more and more \nlinks uncoil off the ground as the bar is lifted further from the floor \nduring the concentric phase, making the load progressively heavier. \nSimilarly, with bands attached to the bar and anchored to the floor, \nthe resistance on the bar increases during the concentric as the bands \nstretch. Either method changes the resistance curve of the movement, \nas typically the squat is most difficult in the mid-point after ascending \nfrom the hole, the bench press a few inches above the chest, and the \ndeadlift is (typically) hardest below the knee. Subsequently, these \nmovements get easier (not always) as you approach lockout. Adding \naccommodating resistance alters this slightly such that as you gain a \nbiomechanical advantage, load also increases. \nThe use of bands and chains gained original popularity with equipped \nlifters. To some degree, bands and chains mimic the strength curve of \nlifting with suits, knee wraps and bench shirts. This lifting equipment \nprovides most of its assistance in the early stages of the concentric \nphase, and less assistance you approach lockout. However, suits, wraps \nand shirts are difficult to get in and out of, uncomfortable, and are time-\nconsuming to train with. Subsequently, training in equipment is not \ndone year-round. Instead, a fair amount of time is often spent training \nraw with accommodating resistance, to provide a bit more specificity \nto lifting in equipment.   \nThe latest meta-analytic data suggests there is not an advantage of \ntraining with accommodating compared to traditional resistance [18]. \nHowever, it is worth noting studies haven’t assessed the effect of \ntraditional versus accommodating resistance on equipped 1RM strength. \nFurthermore, just because accommodating resistance may not be \nbetter on average, doesn’t mean it couldn’t prove to help individuals \nwith specific weaknesses near lockout. Finally, it has been proposed \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n162\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthat generating greater force prior to a weak point in a lift may help by \nhelping momentum to carry you through a sticking point [17]. \nWhile traditional, heavy resistance training is an effective way to \nincrease the rate of force production, explosive “power” type training \n(often called “speed work”) has been proposed as well. Accommodating \nresistance can be helpful for power training as traditional speed work \nwith light loads results in a “braking” phase near lockout [19] as you \ndecelerate the bar to prevent your back from “jumping” off the bench \nor your feet from leaving the floor when squatting or deadlifting. With \nbands or chains, the increasing resistance makes lighter loads heavier \nnear lockout, preventing this from occurring [20]. Thus, bands or chains \ncan allow you to attempt to accelerate the bar through the full range \nof motion. Therefore, an argument could be made if you are a lifter \nwho gets stuck right off your chest when benching, in the hole when \nsquatting, or who can’t break the bar off the ground when deadlifting, \nthat explosive training (possibly with accommodating resistance) could \nbe of utility. However, it seems that whether or not explosive training \nimproves the rate of force development compared to just heavy lifting, \nis highly individual [21]. \nTo summarize weak points and sticking regions, let’s recap the potential \napproaches a powerlifter or strength athlete might take [17]:\n1.\t\nPauses at certain points in a range of motion to “break up” a\nmovement and improve motor learning. But probably not pausing\nat a sticking point.\n2.\t\nIsometric training at a point where you have a force deficit (finding\nthis exact point would require motion capture or lab equipment,\nunfortunately).\n3.\t\nUsing variations on the main lifts that force you to use a more\nefficient technique, and avoid technical errors that are often\nlimiting factors at maximal loads.\n4.\t Explosive training to improve the rate of force development prior\nto a sticking point, with or without accommodating resistance (not\neveryone is a responder to this type of training, unfortunately [21]).\nWhen assessing the above options as a lifter or coach, you’ll see\nthere is a degree of guesswork involved in implementing some of\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n163\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthe options, and a great deal of individuality in most as well. Thus, \nI want to reiterate that choosing variations on the main lifts, be \nthey with pauses, bands or chains, limited or increased range of \nmotion, etc., should be intentional and logically informed. They \nalso aren’t required. Sometimes the best way to improve a lift is to \ndo more practice with the lift in competition form. Don’t confuse \nvariation with randomization, be intentional.\nFinally, it’s important to understand that in reality, sticking points don’t \nactually change. Rather, addressing them might be a more efficient way \nto attack the weakest link in the chain of a movement, and therefore a \nfaster way to increase strength. If this ends up being the case for you, \nthe stick will still occur, you’ll just be able to lift more weight despite it.\nA Note on Form\nAs I already mentioned, proper form can be critical in order to engage \nmuscles in a uniform manner in compound lifts such as a lat pulldown. For \nbodybuilders, exercises are simply a means to end; they are performed \nto achieve muscle growth. On the other hand, strength athletes must \nperform specific exercises. Thus, for powerlifters, the mastery of the \nsquat, bench press and deadlift is critical to avoid injury and lift as \nheavy a load as possible.\nDue to this distinction, many bodybuilders focus on a concept called the \n‘mind-muscle connection’, suggesting that to effectively train a muscle \ngroup you must have a kinesthetic awareness of it during a movement. \nWhile it is true that focusing on a target muscle group can enhance \nactivation [16, 22], when loads get heavy (80% 1RM or higher) on a \ncompound lift such as the bench press, this effect seems to go away \n[22]. Meaning, that when a load is light enough that you can move it \nwithout the effective involvement of all muscle groups contributing to \nthe movement, the emphasis can be partially shifted from one muscle \ngroup to another. However, when a compound lift is performed with \na high load, all muscle groups must maximally contribute in order to \ncomplete the movement.\nFor this reason, even if you are a bodybuilder, focusing on the ‘mind-\nmuscle connection’ during the performance of your heavy compound \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n164\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nlifts probably isn’t aiding you. Unless you have a specific issue as I did \nwith my back activation, simply performing compound lifts with heavy \nloads correctly will result in maximal activation of the involved muscles. \nThink about it logically, if you weren’t able to maximally activate your \nmuscles during a heavy compound lift, how would you lift the weight?\nMy advice is that while it is important to ensure you are engaging muscles \nin a uniform way while performing compound lifts, internally cueing \nthe activation of single muscle groups is probably only effectively used \nwhen you are trying to learn or re-train a movement pattern like I was \nfor my back work. Once I was able to actively engage all of the target \nmuscles, I began lifting heavier loads focusing on the proper execution \nof the form. So while the ‘mind-muscle connection’ is real, it might only \nhave applications for isolation exercises and as a tool in the process \nof developing proper technique or when you have issues engaging \nspecific muscle groups.\nExercise Order\nFinally, once you have selected your exercises, you must consider how \nyou order them. It is important to note that you will be able to perform \nmore volume with the exercises performed first in a session when you \nare fresh [23, 24]. Logically, this means that the compound barbell \nexercises should be performed first in most cases. These exercises are \nthe most complex, the most fatiguing, have the highest injury risk, and \nalso stimulate the most hypertrophy with each repetition performed as \nthey train many muscle groups at once.\nHowever, in the specific case of a bodybuilder with a glaring weak \npoint that is not trained by one of these compound lifts, it may be \nadvisable to perform an isolation exercise for this muscle group first \n[9]. Doing so may allow you to accumulate a bit more volume on this \nlift to help offset this weak point. However, this strategy should only be \nused if fatiguing this muscle group would not hinder the performance \nof your compound barbell exercises to a significant degree (potentially \nhindering overall development or even risking injury).\nFor example, a bodybuilder with weak biceps or calves may decide to \ntrain them first before doing overhead press, or bench press or squats \nor deadlifts, respectively. Training the biceps before the bench press \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n165\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwon’t negatively influence the performance of this exercise. Likewise, \ntraining the calves prior to a squat or a deadlift should have a minimal \neffect on the performance of these lifts as well.\nRange of Motion\nAs the final portion of Level 4, let’s discuss ‘range of motion’.\nFirst, notice this discussion did not occur earlier in this chapter under \nthe “Note on Form” section. I point this out because some people are \nfar too dogmatic in their approach to range of motion, believing that \nthere is never a reason to perform anything less than maximal range \nof motion, and anyone doing so has “poor form”. This attitude does \nnot pay respect to individual differences in bone structure, soft tissue \nextensibility, and the resultant safe ranges of motion person to person. \nIndeed, this dogmatic view when forced on others can lead people to \ntrain in unsafe ways in some cases.\nWhat we should be advising, is specifically to train with the full range \nof motion you have. For example, squatting until your hamstrings and \ncalves touch is fantastic… if you can do it while keeping a neutral spine \nand your feet flat. If you round your lower back to achieve this position, \nthat’s probably not a good thing. \nWith that said, it’s worth pointing out that studies comparing partial \nto full range of motion squats [25], biceps curls [26], and leg training \n(including various free weight and machine movements) [27], have all \nshown greater hypertrophy when using a full range of motion; even \nthough the partial range of motion groups can lift heavier loads. So, \nwhile you should train with the full range of motion you have, if you \nhave limited joint range motion, it’s probably a good idea to slowly try \nto increase it. Do this by making small increases in the range of motion \nin the weight room and by stretching—just not immediately prior to \ntraining (more to come on this in the sample program chapter). \nAs a final note on range of motion, as I mentioned previously, strength \nis specific. This applies to range of motion as well. If you do partial \nsquats, you get stronger at partial squats with poor transfer to full \nsquats [25]. However, full squats tend to make you stronger at both \nthe full movement, and partial variations (since the full range includes \nEXERCISE SELECTION\n166\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwhat is trained in a partial rep) [25]. So, while there are cases where \nit is worth targeting specific portions of a lift (see Movement Weak \nPoints and “Sticking Regions”), you should still include some full-range \ntraining as well, to ensure you don’t lose specific strength.\nSummary\nSpecificity\n}\n} The movements you want to get stronger at should dominate your \nprogram.\n}\n} If your goal is hypertrophy, it’s still a good idea to include compound \nbarbell movements. These lifts give you the biggest bang for \nyour buck, but you want to make sure that you have proportional \ndevelopment everywhere and that you’re not neglecting anything. \nSo, you will have a mix of multiple compound movements as well \nas more isolation movements, but not so many so that you are not \nproficient in their execution. You will be a jack of all trades as a \nbodybuilder rather than a specialist in two or three lifts, but you \nmust still be good at what you do so that the motor learning process \nisn’t getting in the way of muscle growth.\n}\n} If you are a powerlifter or a strength athlete, you need to be a \nspecialist. But, you will also need to choose exercises that help \nyou perform. Don’t rigidly adhere to a single movement, as taking \nspecificity too far can cause issues in some cases. You must do the \ncompetition lifts, but sometimes a weak link in the chain, either \nin terms of strength or the potential for injury, might require the \ninclusion of non-specific lifts.\nEfficiency\n}\n} Hammer the compound movements primarily for uniform, muscular \ndevelopment in a time efficient manner. However, include isolation \nexercises as needed to ensure no weak points develop and that \nevery muscle group is effectively trained.\nWeak Points\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n167\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} Weak points can develop for structural reasons that may require \nmore focus on specific muscle groups if your goal is bodybuilding.\n}\n} Biomechanical issues like limb lengths might make certain exercises \nless than ideal if your goal is purely hypertrophy. If your goal is \nstrength, you may not be well built for a competition lift, but you \nmust still master it. Without the option to swap it out for another \nlift, instead, use other lifts more suited to your biomechanics as \nassistance exercises.\n}\n} Proper form is vital to ensure you are effectively engaging all the \ntarget muscle groups in a balanced manner.\nExercise Order\n}\n} In most cases, perform compound barbell exercises first when \nyou are fresh to optimize your performance. If you have a single \nmuscle group that is a weak point that if fatigued won’t hinder the \nperformance of your compound lifts for the day, it can be trained \nfirst for the same reason.\nEXERCISE SELECTION\n168\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nSUMMARY OF EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS\nExercise Selection Guidelines\nStrength\n(Powerlifter)\nCompetition lifts for 50–75% of the total volume.\nAccessory work for 25–50%\nHypertrophy\n(Bodybuilder)\n1–2 compound exercises for each major muscle \ngroup.\n1–3 isolation exercises for each muscle group.\nREST PERIODS\n172\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHow long one rests between sets has been theorized to be an important \nvariable for resistance training, specifically when the goal is hypertrophy. \nHowever, the mechanisms by which short rest intervals are thought to \naugment hypertrophy have been questioned and a solid body of research \nnow challenges this convention. In this chapter, we discuss the ins and \nouts of rest periods and give practical recommendations to help you \navoid potentially degrading your training quality and also to potentially \nallow you to complete your training in a more time-efficient manner.\nThe Hormone Hypothesis \nIn Level 2 we stated that the traditionally recommended repetition range \nof 8–12 is not superior to other rep ranges for the purposes of inducing \nhypertrophy for any mechanistic reason. Rather, this repetition range is \npractically useful in that it allows you to accumulate volume in a time-\nefficient manner with a heavy enough load to produce hypertrophy. \nThe distinction between this being the practical versus mechanistic rep \nrange for hypertrophy stems from the history of the research in this area.\nIn the late ’80s, ’90s, and through the early 2000s, a large body of \nevidence was accumulated that seemed to suggest that the hormonal \n“spikes” that occurred for short periods after resistance training were \nassociated with hypertrophy. These associations were consistently \nfound, and eventually, it became nearly a foregone conclusion that if \nyou wanted to optimize hypertrophy, you had to design your training \nin a way that created the largest hormone (typically growth hormone) \nspike possible post-training [1]. This body of evidence is what led to the \nhypertrophy-training recommendations of using compound movements, \nmoderately-high repetitions and short rest intervals, because all of these \nmethods caused a large post-exercise hormone response.\nThis viewpoint went largely unchallenged until the late 2000s when \na number of research groups began testing, and then subsequently \nquestioning, this conventional thinking [2–7]. As was previously discussed, \nit is now known that to a point there is a dose-response relationship with \nvolume of resistance training and hypertrophy. However, higher volumes \nof training also carry a greater metabolic demand as more fuel is needed \nto perform more work. Importantly, one of the many functions of growth \nhormone is to mobilize fuel. Thus, it has been speculated that at least \nREST PERIODS\n173\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nin part, the hormone responses associated with hypertrophy were not \nnecessarily causing the muscle growth, they were in fact caused by the \ntraining, which was causing the growth. Meaning, that rather than the \nhormone response being the mechanism causing hypertrophy, it was \nsimply correlated with muscle growth because high-volume training \nproduced a large growth hormone response [4].\nThis is not to say that hormones have no impact on muscle growth. \nCertainly, we know that anabolic steroids (testosterone) taken \nexogenously as performance-enhancing drugs in supra-physiological \namounts can have large impacts on muscle growth and strength \n[8]. However, continuously injecting anabolic steroids in much larger \namounts than are present naturally is completely different than \ntemporary elevations that occur post-exercise in the much smaller \n(natural) physiological range. Additionally, growth hormone, which was \nprimarily emphasized in the hormone hypothesis, unlike testosterone, \ndoesn’t appear to have a significant impact on hypertrophy even when \ntaken at supraphysiological levels comparable to doping programs for \na full month [9]. For these reasons, recommendations for hypertrophy \ntraining based on post-exercise hormone manipulation have been \nseriously questioned.\nUnderstandably, this questioning also carried into the research on \nrest periods. In one study, a group of researchers found that the acute \nanabolic hormone response was higher in a group resting one minute \nbetween sets compared to a group resting two and a half minutes. \nHowever, interestingly, muscle growth in the arm favored the longer \nrest period group [10]. Most likely, this was because the loads selected \nin this study were chosen so that the final sets on exercises were taken \nto failure. Thus, the longer rest period group most likely was able to use \nheavier loads in training. To conclude, at this stage we can confidently \nstate that the hormonal response to exercise is not the cause of \nsubsequent muscle growth, and therefore the recommendation to \nrestrict rest intervals to enhance hormonal response is unfounded. But, \nare there other ways that restricted rest periods could aid hypertrophy?\nMetabolic Fatigue \nBesides progressive tension overload, which is the primary driver \nREST PERIODS\n174\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nof natural skeletal muscle growth in adults [11], muscle damage and \nmetabolic fatigue have also been proposed to play roles in resistance \ntraining-induced hypertrophy [12]. As was discussed in Level 2, the \nresult of effective hypertrophy training is the combination of increased \nstrength and muscular work capacity. As the muscle cell increases in \nsize and its work capacity increase concomitantly, the eventual result \nis an optimized increase in muscle size. \nBoth low and high-load training can be used in hypertrophy training. \nLow-load, high-repetition training can produce appreciable muscle \ngrowth [13, 14] as it forces the muscle to adapt to a high workload and \nif taken to failure stresses the fiber’s ability to keep contracting. For \nthis reason, an argument can be made that by restricting rest periods, \none could enhance metabolic fatigue to cause hypertrophy [15]. \nHowever, training that primarily emphasizes metabolic fatigue would \nprove suboptimal if it subverted the primary driver of hypertrophy, \nprogressively increasing tension and volume over time [16].\nFor example, it is well established that using very short rest intervals \ncan reduce the number of repetitions that can be performed on \nsubsequent sets [17]. Thus, if you restrict rest periods for the purpose \nof increasing metabolic fatigue to the point where you perform fewer \ntotal repetitions, or have to use lighter loads on subsequent sets, you \nare essentially “throwing the baby out with the bathwater”. Meaning, \nyou have sacrificed total volume for metabolic fatigue.\nIn fact, the rare study that showed the superiority of shorter (1 min) \ncompared to longer (4 min) rest intervals for hypertrophy, was designed \nso that the participants trained sub-maximally (not to failure) and \ntherefore didn’t risk “losing reps” [18]. While this is a smart way to train \nin real life (see Level 2), as it allows you to perform more volume with \nsubsequent sets and in subsequent days and weeks of training, for \nresearch intended to determine the mechanistic effect of rest intervals, \nthis is a confounding variable. If both groups are not training to failure \nbut using similar loads, this would mean that the group resting one \nminute would be less recovered between sets. Thus, due to cumulative \nfatigue, they would be providing more stress per set even if the sets and \nreps are the same. While you could argue that this is the appropriate \nway to train; restricting rest intervals but not restricting them so much \nREST PERIODS\n175\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nas to detract from subsequent set performance, you also have to \nremember that in the real world we don’t just manipulate rest periods, \nbut also volume and load. Yes, a restricted rest period can be used to \ninduce overload, but if you had the option of doing more repetitions \nwith a heavier load or restricting rest intervals, the option of doing \nmore volume with a heavier load would be the better choice.\nMuscle Damage\nBut what about the role of decreased rest intervals and their effect on \nmuscle damage? \nFirst of all, the muscle damage response to decreased rest intervals \nis inconsistent, and variable between individuals [19]. But even \nmore importantly, we have to unpack the role of muscle damage in \nhypertrophy.\nLike the growth hormone response to high volumes of moderate-load \ntraining, muscle damage has to occur to some degree when performing \nprogressive resistance training. Muscle fibers are damaged and must \nregenerate during the process of completing muscular work. If you \ncomplete a large volume of work, there will logically be a larger amount \nof muscle damage. For this reason, it is difficult to discern whether \nmuscle damage is causative, additive, or simply an unavoidable intrinsic \nprocess that occurs alongside resistance training-induced hypertrophy.\nWhile this is an evolving field, certainly it is known that in a practical \nsense, noticeable muscle damage is not required for muscle growth. \nMeaning, that you don’t have to purposely design a training program \nto elicit damage and subsequently cause yourself soreness to ensure \ngrowth [20]. In fact, muscle damage can reduce force production \ncapacity which can result in lowered volume and intensity in subsequent \ntraining bouts [21, 22]. Indeed, excessive muscle damage can actually \ninterfere with hypertrophy [23]. This is not to say that damage should \nbe avoided, rather that it simply does not need to be sought out. An \nappropriate amount of damage will occur naturally as you try to ensure \nprogressive overload in your training by following the principles in \nLevels 2 and 3.\nTo conclude, if the rationale for reducing your rest periods is to augment \nREST PERIODS\n176\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nhormonal response, metabolic fatigue, or muscle damage, that rationale \nneeds to be reconsidered. The potential detrimental effect of short rest \nperiods on your ability to perform outweighs any potential benefit of \nshort rest periods.\nThe Final Word On Short Rest Periods For \nHypertrophy\nIf the above explanation of why the proposed arguments are flawed for \nusing short rest periods to augment muscle growth didn’t sway you, I \nhave a feeling that the sheer weight of the evidence might:\n}\n} De Souza [24] found no significant difference in muscle cross-\nsectional area when comparing rest intervals of 2 minutes to rest \nintervals as short as 30 seconds.\n}\n} In a 6-month study by Ahtiainen [25], 2-minute rest periods were \ncompared to 5-minute rest periods with matched volume programs \nof differing intensities, and no significant differences in muscle size \nwere found.\n}\n} In Schoenfeld’s 2014 study [26] using matched volumes in a \npowerlifting style split compared to a bodybuilding style split, \nmuscle thickness changes were not significantly different in the \npowerlifting style group using 3-minute rest periods and the \nbodybuilding style group using 90-second rest periods.\n}\n} In our review on bodybuilding training, we stated, “No investigation \nto date has yet found variations in rest periods between 1 to 5 \nminutes to alter the hypertrophic response.” [16].\n}\n} In a review in Sports Medicine by Henselmans and Schoenfeld on \nrest intervals for hypertrophy [19], the authors stated, “To date, no \nstudy has demonstrated greater muscle hypertrophy using shorter \ncompared with longer rest intervals. Longitudinal studies that \ndirectly measured hypertrophy in groups with various rest intervals \nfound either no differences between groups or, in the study by \nBuresh et al. [10], a higher increase in muscle girth in the group using \n2.5-min rest intervals than in the group using 1-min rest intervals.”\n}\n} In two systematic reviews by Grgic and colleagues, the first on \nREST PERIODS\n177\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nstrength [27] and the second on hypertrophy [28], in both cases, \nit was concluded that while shorter rest intervals still allowed for \nrobust strength and hypertrophy responses, longer rest intervals \nseemed superior.\nAs we previously stated, it’s the rare study [18] that shows the superiority \nof shorter rest periods for hypertrophy, and this is more than likely due to \nwhat I would argue is a study design issue. While on the other hand, the \nmajority of studies show either no difference [24, 25] or the superiority \nof longer rest periods [10] for muscle growth, which was confirmed in \ntwo systematic reviews on both strength and hypertrophy [27, 28].\nA Place For Reduced Rest Periods In Training \nFrom what we’ve discussed so far in this section, it may sound like the \nonly reasonable recommendation would be to rest as long as you want, \nauto-regulate your rest periods and then train when you are ready.\nIn fact, this is a logical conclusion to make. But is there a place for reduced \nrest periods in training? I would argue that there is, in a way, using forms \nof training that save time without compromising stimulus. The first of \nsuch training modalities is what’s called ‘antagonist paired sets’.\nAntagonist Paired Sets\nSimply put, an antagonist paired set (APS), is performing one set on an \nexercise, and then instead of performing a second set on that exercise \nafter resting, you perform a set on an exercise that is the ‘antagonist’ \nof the muscle group trained on the first set. An example would be \nperforming a set of leg extensions and then performing a set of leg \ncurls. The joint action of extending the knee, is ‘antagonistic’ to the \njoint action of flexing the knee, hence the name.\nNow honestly, this is something we in the bro community would just \ncall ‘supersets’; where during the rest interval of one exercise, instead \nof just purely resting, another exercise is performed. But there is an \nimportant distinction. Supersets are often performed with an exercise \nthat trains the same muscle group, while with APS the opposite muscle \ngroups are used in the second exercise. For example, a set of shoulder \nREST PERIODS\n178\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\npresses immediately followed by a set of lat pulldowns is an APS, a \nshoulder press followed by a front raise is not. Other examples are a leg \nextension paired with leg curls, bench press paired with rows, or bicep \ncurls paired with tricep extensions.\nUsing supersets to train the same muscle group is essentially an \napproach that emphasizes metabolic fatigue. Often, these supersets \nare performed in such a way that can actually hamper total volume. For \nexample, if you are supersetting shoulder press with front raises, and \nusing minimal rest periods, not only will you run into the potential issue \nof “losing reps” like we discussed earlier, but also the fatigue generated \nfrom performing one shoulder exercise will decrease the load you will \nbe able to lift on the other. While you might stimulate a lot of muscle \nfibers via fatigue and training the shoulders to failure, the total training \nvolume and the mechanical tension will likely be substantially less than \nhad you rested between sets.\nInterestingly enough, APS, unlike supersets, can potentially allow you \nto increase performance.\nImagine that you do the bench press paired with a bench pull (commonly \nreferred to as a ‘seal row’ by the cool kids these days). When doing \nthe bench press you’re training your pushing musculature, then you go \nover and you do your seal row. While you’re doing your seal row you’re \nessentially resting all of the pushing musculature while you’re training \nyour pulling musculature. However, because the antagonists are being \nmoved through an active range of motion but not actively contracting \nagainst the load, it has been proposed that this might produce some \nsort of active recovery or potentiation effect that could actually improve \nperformance when returning to the antagonist exercise. In fact, one \nstudy on APS for bench pulls and bench press found exactly that — an \nincrease in the volume load performed in the APS group compared to \nthe traditional group [29]. (As a side note, as I mentioned in the last \nchapter, the long head of the triceps does contribute to a degree to \nshoulder extension, thus for those who get triceps fatigue from pulling \nmovements this strategy should perhaps be avoided.)\nA review on APS in 2010 concluded that overall this improved \nperformance effect is not always necessarily shown in research, but \nat the very least structuring training in this manner could be a time \nREST PERIODS\n179\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nefficient way to train that would not harm performance [30]. However, \nsince the publication of that review, more studies have been conducted \nwhich found a performance-enhancing effect [31] and others have \nclarified when it might be a bad idea to implement this strategy [32].\nSo How Does One Implement Antagonist Paired Sets in an \nEffective Manner?\nWell, first you have to remember that despite the practical similarity, the \nunderlying philosophy of APS is fundamentally different from supersets. \nInstead of ramping up fatigue, you are trying to improve muscular \nperformance to enhance volume. So, when performing APS with compound \nupper body push and pull movements, you want to ensure the cumulative \nfatigue doesn’t detract from performance, so resting between sets is still \nimportant. Basically, you would pair a push and a pull, and complete a set \nof each in roughly a 3–4 minute period. This allows the completion of one \nset on the pushing exercise, a rest period of two minutes or so, and then \nthe completion of one set on the pulling exercise [29]. Because these \nare compound exercises that can produce significant total body fatigue, \nI would advise auto-regulating your rest periods and simply performing \nthe next set on the antagonist exercise when you feel ready if you don’t \nquite feel ready after a two-minute rest period.\nWhen you are performing isolation exercises with APS, such as tricep \nextensions and bicep curls, or leg curls with leg extensions, there is \nless total body fatigue to worry about. In the research examining APS \nfor isolation exercises, more repetitions are performed when the rest \nperiod is approximately one minute between sets on opposing muscle \ngroups [31]. Thus, you might perform a set of leg extensions, rest one \nminute or so, then perform a set of leg curls, as an example.\nFinally, we do need to talk about when this strategy can go wrong. \nOne study found that performing squats with a three-minute rest \ninterval, but doing a set of bench press and seal rows during this rest \ninterval, reduced total repetitions performed on squats [32]. Truly, a \nsquat is a full-body movement. Even though the legs are the primary \nmovers, the load is supported on the back. Thus, all of the muscles that \nsupport the spine and posture have to be aggressively activated in \norder to perform each rep. Meaning, squats and other movements that \nREST PERIODS\n180\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nrequire full-body effort generate local fatigue in many muscle groups \nat once and also generate a lot of cardiovascular stress that can leave \nyou winded. Therefore, for “full-body exercises” such as the deadlift, \ndeadlift variants, back squats, squat variants, and lunges it’s a good \nidea to simply rest between sets without doing anything else. I would \neven argue that powerlifters should be cautious when considering \nusing APS with the bench press. Many consider a properly performed \npowerlifting bench press as a full-body movement due to the intended \n‘leg drive’ that is used.\nExample Programming With APS\nImagine you have an upper-body day pairing a horizontal push with a \nhorizontal pull, a vertical push with a vertical pull, and a tricep exercise \nwith a bicep exercise.\nProgramming this day with APS might look like the following:\nIncline Bench\nOverhead Press\nTricep Press-downs\n~2 minutes rest\n~2 minutes rest\n~1 minute rest\nSeal Row\nChins\nBicep Curls\n~2 minutes rest\n~ 2 minutes rest\n~1 minute rest\nIncline Bench\nOverhead Press\nTricep Press-downs\n~2 minutes rest\n~2 minutes rest\n~1 minute rest\nSeal Row\nChins\nBicep Curls\n~ 2 minutes rest\n~2 minutes rest\n~1 minute rest\nIncline Bench\nOverhead Press\nTricep Press-downs\n~2 minutes rest\n~2 minutes rest\n~1 minute rest\nSeal Row\nChins\nBicep Curls\n~2 minutes rest\n~2 minutes rest\nNot only will this not negatively affect your performance, but it may \nREST PERIODS\n181\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nalso positively affect your performance. Plus, much of the time you \nwould usually spend sitting on your butt listening to music or getting \ndistracted by Facebook or Instagram posts will be spent training. You \ncan finish your workout earlier, and accomplish the same amount of (if \nnot more) total volume while maintaining your loads.\nHowever, if you are a bodybuilder and you have a leg day that includes \nthe squat, or a back day that includes the deadlift or if you’re doing \na deadlift variant, a squat variant, a lunge, or some other movement \nthat requires a lot of full body effort and stabilization, APS would not \nbe advised as it could potentially harm the performance of the main \nmovement—rest as much as you need so you can give it all you’ve got.\nLastly, don’t forget the obvious time you would not want to do this: \nwhen the gym is very crowded and holding two pieces of equipment \nwould be rude or impossible. \nDrop Sets and Rest-Pause Sets\nBesides APS, there are other methods of performing sets which can be \neffective in different circumstances depending on the goal. In the lifting \ncommunity, these approaches are often called ‘intensity techniques’ as \nthey often have to do with working past failure or in a fatigued state, \nbut not always. \nFirst, let’s discuss drop sets. Drop sets are simply when you hit failure \nwith a given load, and then you reduce load so you can keep going. \nYou will only get a few reps each drop because even though the load is \nreduced, you are fatigued from the previous sets. This is a time-saving \ntechnique as it allows you to keep muscle recruitment high and keep \nstimulating fibers with lower loads that would normally require way \nmore reps because you “primed” the drops with the initial set to failure. \nIn one study, a group that performed 3 sets of 80% 1RM to failure with 3 \nminutes rest between sets was compared to a group that did one set with \n80, 65, 50, 40, and 30% of 1RM, all to failure, while only taking enough \ntime between sets to switch dumbbells. The drop set group completed \ntheir protocol in just over 2 minutes and did a total of 35 reps across \nthe various loads they used at each drop, while the traditional training \ngroup took just under 7 minutes to complete their protocol and did 15 \nREST PERIODS\n182\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nreps total on average. Both groups improved strength and size without \nsignificant differences between one another [33].\nSo, as you can see the drop set group was more time efficient, but on \na rep by rep basis, the work they performed was less efficient (similar \ngains, more than twice as many reps). Does this ‘rep efficiency’ matter? \nIn a practical sense no, it was just as effective and allows you to get in \nand out of the gym in less time. But I point out the difference in volume \nbecause this is an arbitrary comparison; in the real world, we have no \nway to know how to compare straight sets to drop sets. A normal set \nfollowed by four drop sets seemed equivalent to three straight sets \nin this study, but is that the norm? How big of drops should you take? \nHow many reps should you be able to get on each drop? We simply \ndon’t know the answers to these questions. \nTo get around this ambiguity, you can just compare sessions where you \ndo drop sets to one another. For example, if using the setup above, you \ncould gauge progress week to week by when you are able to do more \nreps at each of the drops (80, 65, 50, 40, and 30% of 1RM) or by when \nyou can do a similar number of reps at each drop, but with greater \nloads (i.e. your 1RM has increased). However, you wouldn’t really be \nable to compare volume during a program with a lot of drop sets very \neffectively to a program without them from a more meta sense. \nIf drop sets are a small part of your approach this isn’t a big deal, but \nthe more dominant a role they play, the more you end up shooting \nin the dark. One of the most important aspects of making continued \nprogress towards your goals is being able to gauge your progress by \nmaking “apples to apples” comparisons between different combinations \nof volume, intensity, frequency, and exercise selection. So sometimes \nit’s not a question of whether it works in a study, but rather taking the \nlong-term lifting career view. The question at play is, how do you keep \ninducing progressive overload if you can’t quantify overload? \nRest-pause sets are similar to drop sets but don’t include a load reduction. \nRest-pause sets are typically defined as selecting a load, training to \nfailure, resting around 20–30 seconds, doing more repetitions to failure, \nand repeating this process until you’ve reached a target number of \nreps. For example, let’s say you had the goal of reaching 15 reps with \nREST PERIODS\n183\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n100 lb, and you did 100 lb for 9 reps to failure, rested 30 seconds, did \n5 more reps to failure, rested thirty seconds, then did your final 1 rep. \nLike drop sets, this technique has been shown to be effective in \npromoting strength and hypertrophy adaptations [34] and also saves \ntime. If you did 3x5x100 lb (which would be a 6–8 RPE across all sets) \nwith 2 minutes rest between sets, that would take ~5 minutes, while \nthe drop set protocol would take only ~2 minutes. Again, it works and \nsaves time but, it still presents some tracking issues. In both of the \nabove cases you did 15 reps with 100 lb, so you can compare your reps \nat a given load to previous workouts with that same load even if you \ndidn’t use rest pause (just looking at total reps). Also, you can compare \nvolume load (sets x reps x load) between programs using rest-pause \nsets to those not. However, a general assessment of volume in terms of \nsets performed for a given muscle group or movement (such as I use \nin this book for guidelines), wouldn’t be possible.\nSo How Does One Implement Rest-pause or Drop Sets in an \nEffective Manner?\nSo you are probably thinking, well then how do I use either? Personally, \nI’m not a big fan of drop sets because the quantification of overload \nis especially limiting and the tracking is more of a logistical pain in the \nbutt (you have to track each drop). However, if you are pressed for time \nonly have left an accessory movement left, and one not biomechanically \nsuited to maintaining form while doing rest pause sets (i.e. imagine \nhitting a 10RM on lateral raises and doing rest pause sets of 2–5 reps, \nyou’d have a lot of form breakdown trying to maintain ROM), drop sets \ncan have utility. In the future, if you did drop sets again, you could then \ncompare back to the last performance to gauge progress.\nHowever, I think rest pause sets have more utility than drop sets because \nyou can actually do what’s planned if you are pressed for time. For \nexample, if you have 3x8x225 lb planned, you can just look at that as \n24 reps at 225 lb and get it in via rest pause in a shorter time frame. \nThe downside here is that now you are training to failure (which is \nalso true of drop sets mind you), and if it is a compound main lift, \nthat means training in a fatigued state and potentially ingraining bad \ntechnique and plausibly increasing injury risk. So again, I would keep \nREST PERIODS\n184\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nthis to accessory work where an injury is unlikely, and the fatigue from \nfailure is much reduced. \nHitting failure on compound lifts is generally not a compromise that \npays off in the long run. Sure, that acute set is more stimulating, but \nfatigue can leak into subsequent sessions throwing off your game plan. \nFor example in one study, a group doing 3x10 to failure took an extra \n24–48 hours to recover muscle damage and performance compared \nto a group doing 6x5 with the same load (5 reps short of failure), even \nthough volume and load were identical [35]. \nThe take home? Rest-pause sets probably induce more fatigue than \nstraight sets matched for volume and load, so if you do them use it for \naccessories, and preferably at the point in the week where you have the \nlongest time frame before you train that muscle group or movement \npattern again (e.g. on Friday if you train Mon, Wed, Fri).\nRest Period Recommendations\nAfter all of that information and all of the theory we discussed, in the \nend, the recommendations are quite simple. Rest until you feel ready \nto perform at your best on the next set [19]. However, if you happen \nto be hyperactive when training, or have a history of feeling like you \nneed to sweat, or that you habitually under-rest, it would be a good \nidea to actually clock your rest periods to ensure you rest at least \n1.5 minutes between smaller muscle groups and at least 2.5 minutes \nbetween compound lifts when training in a straight-set fashion. If you \nare performing APS for upper body push and pull exercises, rest for \nroughly 2 minutes between sets on exercises, and if you are performing \nAPS for isolation exercises rest for roughly 1 minute. Drop sets are \neffective time savers, but need to be tracked and only compared to \nother, similarly performed drop sets. Rest-pause sets are also effective \ntime savers which can be applied in more situations without tracking \nconfusion. However, both drop and rest pause sets induce more fatigue \nthan traditional training, and thus should be relegated to accessory \nmovements and you must consider where they fall in the microcycle to \navoid fatigue bleed over.  \nLIFTING TEMPO\n189\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWe have now reached the final and arguably the least important level of \nThe Pyramid. However, this is actually one of the more complex topics. \nFocusing on training minutia over the foundation, without understanding \nthe context, has sent many a trainee down the wrong path. This occurs \nbecause often the things that are the least important are the most \nconfusing (which is probably why people get them wrong so often).\nBecause of this, I get a constant stream of questions from confused \npeople spinning their wheels, obsessing over the minutia. But don’t \nget me wrong, this is not entirely a bad thing. These questions are the \nreason I have written this book to help give you an understanding of \npriorities and what to focus on.\nWhile there is some complexity in this chapter, remember to keep in \ncontext the importance of this information in relation to the bigger \npicture. At this level, we’re discussing topics that yes, if you overthink \nand get them wrong, can slow you down a little. But this isn’t like Levels \n1–4 where you really need to spend effort getting things right; at the \nhighest levels of The Pyramid, we just don’t want to get things wrong.\nIn this final level, we’re talking about tempo, the speed at which you \nare lifting.\nThe concept of controlling tempo has gotten a lot of attention because \nit is thought to be an important aspect of hypertrophy training. Typically, \nthe reason tempo is emphasized is because of the belief that ‘time \nunder tension’ is a critical variable to maximizing muscle growth.\nSo, let’s discuss the reasons tempo has been suggested as an important \nhypertrophy training variable and then evaluate the evidence on this \ntopic before I finally give you some recommendations.\nEccentric Muscle Actions\n‘Eccentric muscle action’ refers to the lowering portion of lifts. Let’s \ndiscuss how this relates to strength and hypertrophy.\nStrength\nTypically, people don’t make recommendations for time under tension \nwhen it comes to the pursuit of strength. The reason is quite simple; it’s \nLIFTING TEMPO\n190\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ndue to the load-velocity relationship. \nAs the load gets heavier, it’s harder to overcome its inertia and it goes \nslower. If you watch a lifter’s third attempt (the final and heaviest) in a \npowerlifting meet, it’s typically the slowest attempt (if they make it). In \npowerlifting, the best lifts, the lifts that increase a lifter’s total the most, \nare the slowest. This is because they are closest to the heaviest load \nthe person can lift [1]. The mark of a well-trained strength athlete is \nthat they can complete 1RM attempts at very slow speeds, as they have \nthe ability to grind through attempts that novices simply don’t [2].\nSo, for strength, this is pretty easy. The load determines the tempo. \nMost wouldn’t argue that when training for strength, you should control \nthe load on the eccentric (the lowering portion) so that you can get in \nthe best position to lift it, and then attempt to accelerate the load (with \ngood form) as quickly as possible (not that it will actually move fast if \nit is heavy) on the concentric (the lifting portion).\nThere is not much debate here; however, there is a lot of discussion \naround tempo for optimizing hypertrophy.\nHypertrophy\nOne of the reasons that the common recommendation is to go slow \non the eccentric portion when training for hypertrophy, is because of \nthe focus on eccentric muscle actions as a training tool in exercise \nscience. I call this a ‘muscle action’ rather than a contraction because \nunlike the concentric, the eccentric is not an active contraction in the \nsame manner—the eccentric portion of a lift is when you are lowering \nthe weight. The muscle is lengthening because you are producing less \nforce than is needed to resist the load; which can occur involuntarily \nbecause the weight is too heavy, or voluntarily when you are controlling \na load into position (for example, setting a coffee cup down).\nThis is an important distinction because many people often only think \nof movement in concentric terms. So for example, when I pick up a \ncup of coffee, the bicep shortens and the load is brought to my mouth. \nWhen I lower it, the triceps aren’t pulling it down, the bicep controls \nthe tension to lower it; this is the eccentric phase. Using an exercise \nexample, the eccentric portion of a squat is when you lower the bar \nLIFTING TEMPO\n191\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n(and yourself) into position, and then the concentric is when you squat \nit up. On a deadlift, unlike a squat, you begin with the concentric, and \nthen when you lower it down this is the eccentric portion of the lift.\nFirst, let’s discuss some of the ins and outs of eccentrics.\n}\n} Because an eccentric action is not active in the same way that a \nconcentric contraction is, it requires less energy. \n}\n} Also, you don’t have to overcome the inertia of the load—you’re just \nlowering it. \n}\n} Finally, an eccentric action occurs as the muscle lengthens, which \n“loads” the structure of the muscle in a way that generates force \n(think of pressing down on a stretched rubber band). \nFor all of these reasons, you are substantially stronger eccentrically \nthan concentrically [3].\nThink about this logically—the amount you can lower ‘into the hole’ in \na squat is more than you can stand up with. That’s why when people \nmiss squats it typically happens on the way up. The same thing with \nbench, you lower it to your chest and then typically get stuck trying to \nget it up off the chest.\nSo you are stronger eccentrically than you are concentrically, and \nbecause of that, in studies on eccentric only training, more volume can \nbe performed (remember sets x reps x load).\nNow you are probably wondering where I am going with this. What does \nthis have to do with tempo, and why should you care about eccentric only \ntraining since it’s difficult to do for most exercises outside of a laboratory?\nWell bear with me, what I’m trying to do is express that the main \nreason why eccentrics are thought to be a useful training modality \nfor developing strength and hypertrophy in the literature, is probably \nbecause you can lift heavier [3], so you produce more tension, and \nmore volume (which takes us back to Level 2 of The Pyramid — VIF).\nNow, unfortunately, some people who read exercise science texts or \nresearch, and then generate content based on that, don’t necessarily \nunderstand this mechanism behind eccentric training and also don’t \nLIFTING TEMPO\n192\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nunderstand that what you can do in a lab doesn’t always necessarily \ntranslate to real training.\nIf you don’t have the equipment to load the eccentric portion heavier \nwhile making the concentric portion lighter (or eliminate it completely), \nsuch as is done in many studies, how can you translate the effectiveness \nof eccentric training to free weights and machines?\nOne thought process is that if the eccentric is so important, you should \nspend more of your time lifting on the eccentric vs. the concentric. \nAn example would be to lift with a normal speed performing the \nconcentric but to lower slowly on the eccentric. The thought is that by \naccentuating the eccentric action it will create more growth.\nHowever, now that you understand the mechanism behind why eccentric \ntraining can be effective, it is clear that excessive slowing of the eccentric \nphase of a lift runs contrary to the benefits of eccentric training.\n}\n} The amount of load you can lift in the gym with a machine or a free \nweight is limited by your concentric strength, the weakest link in \nthe chain. \n}\n} So it doesn’t really make sense from a conceptual standpoint to do \nexcessively slow eccentric actions to try to get greater hypertrophy, \nbecause \n}\n} The whole reason we do eccentrics is to lift heavier, \n}\n} But we can’t lift heavier than we can lift concentrically in the gym, \n}\n} So you’ll be limited by your concentric strength, \n}\n} And then you won’t be using the type of heavy loading that makes \neccentric training beneficial. \n(More on overloaded eccentrics later in this chapter).\nTime Under Tension?\nSo, we now understand that the rationale of using slow tempos to accentuate \nthe benefits of the eccentric portion of a lift is flawed. But, there are other \nreasons why people have stipulated that you want to do a specific tempo \nLIFTING TEMPO\n193\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nor slow down your lifting when you’re training for hypertrophy. The most \nprevalent reason is to get a greater time under tension.\nI’ve put a question mark in the title here because I feel the term ‘time \nunder tension’ is missing something.\nAs we know from the intensity section earlier in the book, there does \nseem to be a certain threshold for the load that you have to lift in \norder to get your gains. Just by being on planet earth you’re constantly \nresisting gravity, and you’re constantly under tension, but you don’t \nsimply continually grow.\nWhat the time under tension concept misses is that it is not just the \ntime spent under tension, but also the magnitude of this tension that \nis important.\nMagnitude of Tension = Force\nThink about this logically. If you think the magnitude of tension doesn’t \nmatter and only the time spent under tension matters, then you’re \ntelling someone that putting on ankle and wrist weights and walking \na marathon in 6 hours would produce a greater stimulus for muscle \ngrowth than lifting challenging weights for an hour.\nIntuitively we know this isn’t true, so therefore we must acknowledge \nthat time under tension is only part of it. To truly consider whether or \nnot lifting tempo is important, we have to consider the magnitude of \ntension we produce, not just the time spent producing it. Fortunately, \nthis is a very easy concept to understand. We produce force, lift \nobjects, and move by generating tension. By contracting our muscles \nand transferring that force to our skeletal structure, we move. Thus, \nforce output scales with muscle tension. The more force generated, the \nhigher the levels of muscle tension.\nAllow me to get a little more into the weeds here…\nForce Multiplied by Time = Impulse\nIn physics, force multiplied by time is impulse. Impulse is essentially \nthe combination of the time spent under tension and the magnitude of \nthat tension.\nLIFTING TEMPO\n194\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nNow there is a pretty cool study where two groups were compared \nperforming an equated volume of squats with different intensities. One \ngroup did 3 sets of 12 with 70% of 1RM and the other group did 6 \nsets of 12 with 35% of 1RM to match the volume of the first group. In \nboth groups, they lifted as fast as they could with maximal intent to \naccelerate the bar (without leaving the ground) [4].\nGetting back to the study, the total time under tension for the training \nsession ended up being much higher in the 35% 1RM group. This makes \nsense, they did 72 reps with 35% 1RM while the 70% of 1RM group did 36 \nreps. If we thought only time under tension was important and not the \nmagnitude of tension, or that only volume was important and that there \nwasn’t a threshold to where load became important, we’d likely conclude \nthat this group doing more repetitions and more time under tension would \nbe getting a better stimulus. However, because we understand that both \nthe magnitude of force and the time spent producing it are important, we \nknow that we should actually be looking at impulse (force x time).\nInterestingly enough, the total impulse was ~25% higher in the 70% 1RM \ngroup despite velocity, power (which is force x velocity), and time under \ntension being higher in the 35% 1RM group [4]. So, you can see that \nsacrificing load to spend more time lifting it, when taken to extremes, \ncan actually hamper the total tension stimulus to the muscle.\nNow, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a reason to train using light loads \nwith a high velocity. If you want to increase power (which is velocity \ndependent) that might make a lot of sense — especially for an athlete \nwho only has to propel his or her body mass or a lightweight implement. \nBut if we’re talking about muscle and strength development, we also \nhave to think about the magnitude of tension. And remember, if we are \ntalking about producing muscle force and the time spent producing it, \nnow we’re talking about impulse, which is force multiplied by time —\nthe area under the force curve.\nAs an aside, there’s a relationship between force and velocity that \nwe’re not going to get into, but if you think about it from a very basic \nperspective, you can only put so much force into a light bar during a \nsquat before you overcome its mass and do a jump squat.\nLIFTING TEMPO\n195\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nKEY\nForce\nTime\nshaded area: \nimpulse\nSlowed Eccentric, Reduced Load & Volume \nAnother relevant study on lifting tempo took a group of lifters through \ntwo different protocols. \nFirst, the lifters maxed out using a 2/0/2 tempo — two-second eccentric, \nno pause, two-second concentric. This is close to a normal lifting tempo \nfor most people using moderate to moderately-heavy loads who aren’t \ntrying to change their lifting speed. Then, days later the lifters tested \ntheir maxes again but using a 4/0/2 tempo, changing the lowering \nspeed to 4 seconds to accentuate the eccentric action.\nAfter determining their 1RMs at these specific tempos, they then days \nlater returned to perform AMRAPs with 75% of 1RM after warming up; \nonce using the 4/0/2 tempo and once using the 2/0/2 tempo. What \ndid they find out? Well unsurprisingly, on the 1RM tests with a 4-second \neccentric they couldn’t lift as heavy. They got more fatigued from going \nreally slow before they pushed it back up. This is kind of a, “So what?” \noutcome, as we previously discussed we know that going very slow (it \nreally is slow, count out loud to 4 seconds using “Mississippi’s”) isn’t \nideal for strength. But what was more interesting was the effect the \ntempos had during the AMRAPs on volume, which as we discussed in \nLevel 2, is highly relevant for hypertrophy.\nOn the AMRAPs, the slower group performed on average about one \nand a half repetitions less, to which you might respond, “So what, the \nLIFTING TEMPO\n196\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nreps took longer, it was probably the same or even more total work.” \nWell, fortunately, they actually measured total work performed. Work \nis the actual physics calculation of volume that takes into account not \nonly the total reps and the load of the bar, but also the distance the \nbar travels. Interestingly enough, the total work was about 10% less in \nthe slower group, which isn’t surprising since they lifted a lighter load. \nTo conclude, the slower tempo forced volume down by compromising \nload. Ironically, by focusing on increasing the total time under tension, \nthis can decrease the total volume and load [5].\nTherefore, it’s critical that you remember not to over-focus on minor \nthings that you think might help you grow to the point where you \nsacrifice the big-ticket items like volume and intensity. This is the same \nkind of thing that happens with rest periods. If your rest periods are \nshort in a bid to increase fatigue, they can actually end up being too \nshort, degrading your ability to use more volume, use higher loads and \ngenerate greater muscle tension.\nIf you are slowing the weight down so much that you have to reduce \nthe load, or you can’t do as many reps, you might be producing less \ntotal impulse—this is probably the best way to think about hypertrophy \nstimulus from a physics perspective.\nSlow Training Inferior in Most Studies \nJust like in Level 5, you may have gotten to the end of my logical \narguments and still might not be convinced. Well, once again, that’s \nfine because if the logic didn’t convince you, the sheer weight of the \nevidence will.\nIndeed, with little exception [6] traditional speed resistance training \nresults in superior adaptations when compared to slower speed lifting \nwhich requires lower loads [7–11]. In fact, in a 2015 meta-analysis that \nexamined the effect of intentional repetition duration on hypertrophy, \nit was concluded that the duration of repetitions had no effect on \nhypertrophy until reaching the point where repetitions lasted 10 seconds \nor longer. At the point where repetitions took this long, it was concluded \nthat this had a negative effect on muscle growth [12]. Finally, in terms \nof strength development, one study actually found that training with \nmaximal intent to accelerate the load on the concentric portion of the \nLIFTING TEMPO\n197\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nbench press resulted in almost double the strength gains compared to \npurposely performing the concentric at half that speed [13].\nExceptions to The Rule\nIn service of being complete, it is important to point out that there is \nevidence showing that deliberately slower tempos of heavy lifting (2–4 \nsecond concentric and eccentric phases with 60–85% 1RM) can help \nwith tendon pain and rehab—although the evidence is a bit stronger for \nisometric and eccentric training [14]. With that said, we are not injury \nspecialists and don’t know how, nor is it within our scope of practice, \nto make recommendations about injury rehab. Rather, I’m just pointing \nthis out so you don’t think any and all uses of slow tempo training are \nmisguided.\nSupramaximal Eccentric Training\nWhile manipulating the time spent performing the eccentric action \ndoesn’t make sense from a hypertrophy or strength development \nstandpoint, savvy readers may be wondering if manipulating the load \nmight have value. \nIf you thought, “Hold on, if you can lower more eccentrically than you \ncan lift concentrically, what would happen if you had some way of \nmaking only the eccentric heavier so a set was more challenging?” you \nare not alone. Indeed, many exercise scientists have investigated this \nspecific question. Most people are 20–40% stronger eccentrically than \nconcentrically, and we know this from watching the bros train. When \nthey grind out the last rep on bench press they can do on their own, \nand their training partner yells “3 more!” you can watch them lower the \nweight back down to their chest three times on their own, while the \nspotter only helps them on the way up when they get stuck (“All you \nbro!!” is traditionally said as well). \nLogically, there is something worth investigating here in my opinion. \nFrom a strength perspective, you are getting to handle loads beyond \nyour concentric maximum, which could be viewed as an ‘overload \nstimulus’ plausibly resulting in beneficial neuromuscular and \narchitectural adaptations for strength. \nLIFTING TEMPO\n198\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nFrom a hypertrophy standpoint, you’re placing a higher tension on your \nmuscles that you could normally not even train with (as it’s greater \nthan your RM for the set), and getting some volume in with it. But \nthere are barriers to the adoption of this type of training as well. For \none, logistically, most free weight exercises don’t lend themselves \nto supramaximal eccentrics. You can get a bro-spot on the bench \npress and other free weight pressing exercises, but squats require a \nvery friendly and strong spotter who doesn’t mind risking injury, and \ndeadlifts are just hilarious to consider (between the legs floor press \nfor your spotter). For the most part, machines are the only way to \ndo supramaximal eccentrics flying solo. You can use two limbs on the \nconcentric, and one limb on the way down for the eccentric, basically \ndoing single arm/leg machine work while self-spotting loads with your \nother arm/leg on the concentric phase only. Unfortunately, when getting \na spotter’s assistance or self-spotting, it’s difficult to gauge how much \nconcentric assistance you are getting session to session which might \nmake performance quite variable.\nBut before you consider doing a block of eccentric training, it’s worth \npointing out that currently, the evidence is limited and unfortunately, \nnot very promising at this stage. \nFor hypertrophy, a meta-analysis of 15 studies found no significant \ndifference between traditional and supramaximal eccentric training, \nand although nonsignificant, the data did trend towards a small benefit \nof eccentric training [15]. \nFor strength, a meta-analysis of only 5 studies found no significant \ndifference between supramaximal eccentrics and traditional training \neither [16]. \nThus, for now, I wouldn’t advise supramaximal eccentric training until \nmore promising research is published. Also, supramaximal eccentric \ntraining is difficult to implement, hard to track, potentially dangerous \nif using free weights, and likely to cause more soreness, damage and \nacutely suppress performance more than normal training. If you’re \nan advanced lifter trying this out in an expert-supervised, controlled \nenvironment as an experimental block to see if you can crack into \nelusive late-career progress, it’s perhaps worth giving a go. But in my \nopinion, most lifters won’t benefit from its use.\nLIFTING TEMPO\n199\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nPractical Guidelines\nSo, given everything discussed above, what is the take-home message?\nActually, it’s quite simple: just lift weights. Yes, just lift the weights. \nDon’t try to intentionally slow down the tempo of lifting (unless you \nare a beginner, then do slow down as needed to perform exercises with \nproper form), just use good form, and lift them.\nNow to be fair this is a slight oversimplification. It’s important to point \nout that letting gravity do the lowering portion of the lift for you is not \na true eccentric action. What makes it an eccentric action is that you \nare in control. This is primarily for those training for hypertrophy. You \nwant to make sure that the eccentric part of the lift is actually a muscle \naction rather than relaxing and letting gravity drop the load back down.\nIf you’re training purely for strength, you can make an argument that \nduring certain time periods you don’t want as much eccentric volume. \nPerhaps you just want to practice the lift — like the deadlift — so you \ndo just let gravity take the bar down. But most of the time, whether \ntraining for hypertrophy or strength, you want to make sure that the \neccentric is performed under some measure of control.\nIn fact, control is very important for strength training; you need to \nhave enough control so that you can get in the right position for the \nconcentric. For example, top-level powerlifters typically lower a squat \nin a relatively controlled manner to ensure they are in the right position \nto squat it back up and complete the lift. Additionally, you don’t get a \n“press” command on bench press until the weight is visibly motionless \non your chest, so lowering it slowly with control can get you a faster \ncommand from the referee because it’s easier to follow when it stops \non your chest. So remember, the eccentric should be controlled so as \nto set you up for a forceful concentric in the right bar path; in these \ncases, a slow eccentric may not only be warranted but would be ideal \nfor performance.\nTo conclude, the biggest debates over tempo are related to time under \ntension. While time under tension is important, so is the magnitude of \ntension. So to ensure you are maximizing muscle growth, ensure that \ngravity is not doing the work for you on the eccentric, and that you’re \ntrying to forcefully accelerate the load on the concentric (Force = mass \nLIFTING TEMPO\n200\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nx acceleration). You want a forceful concentric contraction, and then a \ncontrolled eccentric contraction, but not unnecessarily slow.\nSo once again, just lift the weights!\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n204\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nAfter reading all of the previous chapters you may be experiencing \ninformation overload, or at the very least, having some trouble \n“connecting the dots” between the levels and actually creating an \nactionable resistance training program. This chapter serves to link the \nmain points of each level into a step by step guide to teach you how to \nbuild a training plan. In this chapter, I’ll take you through each level of \nThe Pyramid, highlighting the main points and the subsequent decisions \nyou’ll have to make from each as they relate to building a program. \nRemember, this is a quick start guide, so it won’t include the full breadth \nor depth of knowledge or its explanation from previous chapters. \nRather, it is designed to create an actionable plan to build from. As you \ngain more understanding of the principles, you can use the program \nyou will build as the foundation to lay other concepts on top of.\nStep 1: Adherence\nWhile there is a lot to learn from Level 1, one of the best biggest practical \napplications of the information relates to how many days per week you \ntrain. Specifically, choose a realistic number of training days that would \nnot put stress on your life or schedule. Truly, this value can be anywhere \nfrom 2–6 days per week. \nDetermine whether fewer, longer sessions fit better with your life, or \nmore frequent, shorter sessions. Also, your training age interacts with \nthis decision, as at a certain point it is next to impossible for most people \nto make progress without training at least three times per week. So, if you \nare a novice, you can make a two day per week program work, but after \nthat, the decision boils down to whether you want to train 3–6 days per \nweek as two days per week becomes infeasible with the often-requisite \nvolumes (sessions become far too long, practically, and training quality \nwill tend to degrade towards the latter half of the sessions).\nOnce you’ve come up with a number, this results in a number of possible \nmicrocycle-level setups (AKA ‘splits’) that could fulfill the frequency \nrequirements of Level 2—training each movement/muscle group a \nminimum of twice per week), a maximum of every day.\nIn the chart below you will see sample options for strength (setup for \npowerlifting) or hypertrophy.

Likewise, if you were to choose two ‘full \nbody’ days, you’d end up with more exercises per muscle group, sets \nper exercise, and time spent in the gym per session.\nOn the strength side, it is organized around how often you train the \nbench press, and how often you train squats and deadlifts combined \n(as there is significant overlap between the two in terms of stimulus \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n207\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nand stress). If you choose a very high frequency, again, you end up \ndoing very few working sets per exercise per session, and vice versa. \nEither very-high or very-low frequencies can be problematic depending \non the individual. Most obviously, you don’t want a session to be too \noverloaded for a given movement or muscle group or training quality \ndegrades as the marathon session drones on. However, for some \npeople, certain movements cause connective tissue stress somewhat \nindependently of the total volume and/or load. Thus, high frequencies \nof any significant volume or load become problematic. Simply put, for \n90% of people I’d recommend training 3–5 days per week with a muscle \nor movement frequency of 2–4 times per week, as this typically strikes \nthe best balance between stimulus and recovery.\nSo, pencil in the split you’ve chosen for now, because in step two we’ll \ndiscuss some other potential considerations that might impact your \ndecision.\nStep 2: Volume, Intensity, Frequency\nAs a reminder, these are the broad starting guidelines appropriate for \nmost people:\nVolume: 10–20 sets per muscle group/movement pattern per week\nIntensity:\nStrength: ⅔–¾ of volume in the 1–6 rep range, remaining volume in \nthe 6–15 rep range at a 5–10 RPE\nHypertrophy: ⅔–¾ of volume in the 6–12 rep range, remaining \nvolume in the 1–6 and 12–20 rep range at a 5–10 RPE\nFrequency: 2+/week per muscle group or movement pattern.\nThese variables are how you ensure overload occurs, and how you \norganize it. \nFrequency is already penciled in. Next, let’s choose an appropriate \nvolume. In an ideal world, you’d have meticulous training records \nshowing rates of progress and volume levels at each point of your career \nand you could make an educated start to what would be appropriate \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n208\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ngiven the large individual variance in optimal volume. However, if \nyou’re reading a quick start guide to program design, there is a strong \npossibility that’s not the case.\nThe appropriate volume might depend on a lot of factors, which \ncould logically include: training history, training age, genetics, habitual \nsleep quantity and quality, biological age, total body mass, nutritional \nstatus, psychological resilience to stress, personality, and perhaps sex. \nUnfortunately, we don’t have the relationships of all these variables \nteased out, but there is good anecdotal evidence, a theoretical \nbasis, and limited scientific evidence to suggest that on average, \nmore experienced lifters need more volume to continue progressing. \nThus, with all else being equal, here are some decent guidelines \nfor establishing volume within the 10–20 set recommendation. \nVolume and Frequency Recommendations by Training Age\nTraining Age\nWeekly Sets Per \nMuscle/Movement\nRecommended \nWeekly Frequency\nNovice\n10–12\n2–3\nIntermediate\n13–15\n3–4\nAdvanced\n16–20\n3–5\nNote, the higher your volume, the more it makes sense to spread it \nover more sessions to prevent individual sessions from becoming too \nlong and stressful. This maintains session quality. As you can see in \nthe column on the right, there is a generally recommended weekly \nfrequency at each volume step to better spread stress. If this doesn’t \nmatch up with your split choice from Step 1, consider a different amount \nof volume, or a different split.\nWith your volume level and frequency chosen, whether your goal is \nhypertrophy or strength, you will spread that volume for each muscle \ngroup, or each movement (bench, and split between squats and deadlift \npatterns), across the week. Once again, just pencil this in to get an \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n209\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nidea of how your week is shaping up. For example, let’s say you are an \nintermediate doing 13–15 sets with a 4-day, two times per week muscle \ngroup frequency, doing a 'Legs, Push, Pull, Full Body' split. Spreading \nthings out, you’d probably do 4–6 sets per muscle group on your Full \nBody day, leaving 9–11 sets per muscle group for your Legs, Push, and \nPull days.\nLastly, you’d assign intensity; both the load and the effort. See the two \ncharts below that show appropriate repetition ranges and RPE values for \nstrength and hypertrophy based on exercise and microcycle organization.\nRep and RPE Range General Recommendations for Hypertrophy by \nExercise Type\nExercise\nRep Range \nRPE Range \nLower Free Weight Compound \n(squat, deadlift, RDL, etc.)\n3–8\n5–8\nLower Machine Compound (leg \npress, hack squat, etc.)\n6–12\n6–9\nLower Isolation (calf raise, leg \nextension, leg curl, etc.)\n8–20\n7–10\nUpper Free Weight Compound \n(OHP, bench, BB row, etc.)\n3–12\n6–9\nUpper Machine Compound (lat \npulldown, cable row, etc.)\n6–15\n6–10\nUpper Isolation (curls, tricep \npushdown, lateral raise, etc.)\n8–20\n7–10\nAs you can see, for hypertrophy, the higher the fatigue generated by \nthe movement, and the greater the technical demand, it makes more \nsense to curtail the RPE and rep range. This avoids fatigue bleeding \ninto the rest of a session, may reduce the risk of injury, and also \nensures that the volume you perform is effective because as discussed \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n210\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nin previous chapters, it’s harder to accurately rate RPE on high-rep, \nfatiguing movements. Therefore, compound movements are generally \na better vehicle for doing the portion of your volume that is lower \nrep and thus heavier. Likewise, isolation exercises and machines are \nbetter vehicles for the higher-rep, lower-load portion of your volume. \nRep and RPE Range General Recommendations for Strength by \nGoal\nExercise\nRep Range \nRPE Range \nMain Lift Strength (specific \nstrength in main lifts/variants)\n1–5\n7–10\nMain Lift Volume (for specific \nhypertrophy, work capacity)\n4–8\n5–8\nMain Lift Technique (or “power”, \ntechnical work, recovery)\n1–3\n4–7\nCompound Accessory (OHP, \ngood morning, BB row, etc.)\n4–8\n6–9\nMachine/Isolation Accessory \n(tricep pushdown, HS row, etc.)\n8–15\n7–10\nFor strength, rep and RPE ranges are largely dictated based on whether \nyou are performing a main lift or accessory, and your goal with the \nmovement. For main lifts and variants whether you are building specific \nstrength in the lifts (or strength that easily transfers to them), specific \nhypertrophy and workload capacity with those lifts, or whether you are \nperforming technique work which is heavy enough to be useful, but light \nenough to allow recovery, different RPE and rep ranges are appropriate. \nLikewise, rep range and RPE will change depending on whether you \nare performing compound accessory movements intended to build \ngeneral strength (which are more taxing and technically demanding), or \nmachine and isolation accessories (which are less taxing and technically \ndemanding) for hypertrophy purposes.\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n211\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWhen you combine this information with Step 3, you can really start to \nsee how your program unfolds.\nStep 3: Progression\nAt this stage, the program really starts to take form, and we get to start \nassigning reps and sets across the week and the mesocycle. How this \nshapes up is dictated by the type of exercise (isolation or compound) \nand the rate of progress you can reasonably expect (training age).\nSummary of Progression Strategies\nProgression \nStrategy\nAppropriate \nUses\nExample\nLinear Load \nIncreases\nCompounds \nfor novices\nW1 Day 1: 3x8x100 kg\nW2 Day 1: 3x8x102.5 kg\nLinear \nPeriodization \n(wave loading)\nCompounds \nfor \nintermediates, \nisolation for \nnovices\nW1 Day 1: 3x8x100 kg\nW2 Day 1: 3x7x102.5 kg\nW3 Day 1: 3x6x105 kg\nW4 Day 1: 3x8x102.5 kg\nBlock \nPeriodized \nMesocycles\nCompounds \nfor advanced\nAccumulation W1-6: Sets per week \nincrease from 15 in W1 to 20 in W6. \nRep range 10–20, load increases \nwhen possible, RPE 6–8.\nIntensification W7-10: Sets per \nweek stays at 14.

Then, go up next smallest \nincrement in load and repeat.\nAs a quick recap, linear progression (linear load increases) is simply \nadding more weight to the exercise while keeping reps and sets the \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n212\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nsame each time you repeat a session. \nLinear periodized progression is keeping sets the same, reducing reps \neach session, while increasing load. \nBlock periodized mesocycles are a sequential approach where you \ndo an accumulation mesocycle of higher volume at a moderate RPE \nand higher rep ranges (but specific to your goal), followed by an \nintensification mesocycle of lower volume at a high RPE and lower \nrep ranges (but still specific to your goal), and then taper and test—or \nsimply rinse and repeat after a deload if you can gauge your estimated \nstrength in training (e.g. starting some days with a single at a 6–9 RPE).\nFor a novice, you would simply spread your 10–12 sets per muscle/\nmovement across your days of training, and each week when you repeat \na day’s session, try to increase load (typically the smallest increment \navailable to extend progression longer). \nFor an intermediate, you’d spread 13–15 sets over your days, and follow \na linear (load up reps down) approach week to week, and double \nprogression for your isolation movements. \nFinally, an advanced lifter could set up an accumulation cycle of building \nnumber of sets, followed by an intensification mesocycle similar to how an \nintermediate would progress, and then taper and test, or rinse and repeat.\nTo continue our example, sticking with our 4 days per week, 2/week \nmuscle group training frequency setup as an intermediate with \nhypertrophy goals doing 13–15 sets per week, things start to take shape: \nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n213\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nSample Intermediate 4-day, 2x/week Muscle Group Hypertrophy \nProgram Overview \nLegs: 6–20 \nrep range\nPush: 6–20 \nrep range\nPull: 6–20 \nrep range\nFull Body: \n4–8 rep \nrange\nVolume\n~9 sets/\nmuscle\n~9 sets/\nmuscle\n~9 sets/\nmuscle\n~6 sets/\nmuscle\nCompounds\nWave \nloading 8–12 \nrep range\nWave \nloading 8–12 \nrep range\nWave \nloading 8–12 \nrep range\nWave \nloading 4–6 \nrep range\nIsolations\nDouble \nprogression \n12–15 rep \nrange\nDouble \nprogression \n12–15 rep \nrange\nDouble \nprogression \n12–15 rep \nrange\nDouble \nprogression \n6–8 rep \nrange\nShowing how this plays out in a strength program is a little easier once \nwe discuss exercise selection and break things into categories.\nStep 4: Exercise Selection\nFor a bodybuilder or hypertrophy-focused trainee, you can slot in \nvarious exercises to fill the weekly muscle group volume goals. If you \nview the following table you can see which muscle groups a given \nexercise “counts” for. \nAs it currently stands, we know an exercise that trains a muscle group \nindirectly (labeled 'secondary') probably doesn’t provide quite as much \nstimulus to the muscle as something that trains it directly (labeled \n'primary'), but the scientific data up to this point has counted secondary \nand primary muscle group volume the same. So, count everything on \na one to one basis for each muscle group, just be aware that you don’t \nwant all your volume for a given muscle group coming from indirect \nwork.\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n214\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nHypertrophy: Exercises and Muscle Groups Trained\nMovement Pattern\nPrimary Muscle \nGroups\nSecondary Muscle \nGroups\nSquat (all variations, leg \npress, single leg variants)\nQuads, Glutes\nErectors (if free \nweights)\nHip Hinge (deadlift \nvariations, good morning, \nback ext)\nGlutes, Hams, \nErectors\nScapular \nRetractors\nVertical Pull (chins, lat pull)\nLats, Bis\nRear Delts\nVertical Push (OHP \nvariations)\nAnterior Delts, Tris\nMiddle Delts\nHorizontal Pull (row \nvariations)\nLats, Scapular \nRetractors\nRear Delts, Bis, \nMiddle Delts\nHorizontal Push (flat, incline, \ndecline pushing variants)\nChest, Anterior \nDelts\nTris (CG/dips: \nprimary), Middle \nDelts (incline)\nHorizontal Hip Extension (hip \nthrust, glute bridge etc)\nGlutes\nHams\nPull Over (DB pullover, lat \npushdown, BB pullover etc)\nLats\nTris, Chest\nFly (cable crossover, DB flys)\nChest\nAnterior Delts\nIsolation Exercises\nTarget muscle\nN/A\nFor a powerlifter, however, things are little easier to categorize.

As a reminder, here are the guidelines for how to \ndistribute volume over exercises for strength and hypertrophy.\nExercise Selection Guidelines\nStrength\n(Powerlifter)\nCompetition lifts for 50–75% of the total volume.\nAccessory work for 25–50%\nHypertrophy\n(Bodybuilder)\n1–2 compound exercises for each major muscle group.\n1–3 isolation exercises for each muscle group.\nStep 5 and 6: Rest Periods and Tempo\nAt this stage, you don’t have much left to do. If you’d like, you can set \nup your upper body push and pull exercises with antagonist paired \nsets (APS). Likewise, if your goal is hypertrophy you can set up APS for \nleg extension and leg curl, and biceps and triceps as well. \nAlso, if you are time-pressed and your current setup is pushing the limits \nof what you think you can reasonably accomplish, you can perform \nsome of your accessories or single-joint movements for hypertrophy \nas drop sets or rest pause sets.\nBeyond this, just make sure you rest appropriately, control the eccentric \nto some degree, and perform forceful concentric contractions and \nyou’ve made your way through The Pyramid. All that remains is making \nit more flexible and a bit more specific to your needs.\nCustomizing Your Program with Autoregulation\nNow that you’ve got the basic structure, there are some things you can \ndo to better match this program to your specific needs.\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n217\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nAutoregulating Days Off or Training Days\nIf you recall from the Adherence chapter, training hard when you are most \nrecovered, and matching easier sessions with days you are less recovered \nhas been shown to benefit strength and adherence. So, you can apply this \nby not having fixed training days (e.g. Monday, Wed, Fri) within the week, \nor by having floating off days when you feel you need them the most. This \nhelps with not only your life schedule but may aid performance.\nThe former strategy, flexible training days, works best when training \n2–3 times per week, as you have more off days than training days. The \nlatter strategy, flexible off days, works best when training 4 or more \ndays as you have fewer off days than training days. \nAutoregulating Load\nI’d advise programming with both percentage 1RM and RPE on exercises \nyou test or determine an actual or estimated 1RM on. You can program \nwith percentage 1RM, say 3x8x70% but also provide an RPE range, like \n6–8, and then if the first set at 70% wasn’t in that range, increase or \ndecrease load to something that you think will be. \nFor exercises you don’t estimate or test your 1RM on, you can just \nuse RPE. For novices who don’t yet have the training experience to \naccurately gauge RPE, just track it for now without using it to set or \nmodify load. Give it a few months at least to develop competency with \nRPE before doing so. \nAutoregulating Deloads\nAfter each mesocycle of training (for intermediates when you’ve \ncompleted a progression cycle, for advanced when you’ve completed \na block), use the chart from Level 3 to assess whether a deload (or a \nhigh-rep week maybe with BFR) might be beneficial:\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n218\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nPost Block Assessment\nDreading the gym?\nSleep worse than normal?\nLoads/reps decreasing?\nStress worse than normal?\nAches and pain worse than normal?\nYes to 0-1 questions: start next meso\nYes to 2+ questions: deload week\n*Yes only to aches and pains, high rep week\nMake sure to do a deload just in case every third mesocycle no matter \nwhat if you haven’t run one yet. See Level 3 for specifics on how to \nimplement a deload.\nAutoregulating Exercise Selection\nGiving yourself more choice in exercise selection may allow you to \nenhance your enjoyment, pay heed to any current aches and pains, and \nsubsequently improve performance as discussed earlier in the book. \nFor those interested in hypertrophy, you can change to a different \n‘horizontal pull’ or ‘vertical push’ or ‘hip hinge’ (or any compound lifts) \nmesocycle to mesocycle (so long as you come back to it every few \nmesocycles) instead of sticking with one all the time. Likewise, for \nisolation movements, you can even give yourself the choice to change \nsession to session. If you do so, just make sure to record your training \nloads. This allows you to know where you left off so you can pick back \nup with the appropriate load upon returning to it. \nSimilarly, those who want to gain strength can choose a different variant \non the main lift mesocycle to mesocycle when far from a competition \n(closer to the competition you should choose the competition lift). \nAdditionally, strength focused trainees can switch between variations \nof accessory movements session to session (so long as it trains the \nsame movement pattern or muscle group), like a hypertrophy focused \ntrainee does on isolation movements.\nQUICK START GUIDE TO PROGRAM BUILDING\n219\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nv\nA final consideration for your training plan is how to modify it if you \nare cutting. If it is a brief or non-aggressive cut to sustainable levels of \nleanness, you probably don’t need to modify training at all. However, \nif you are going on a longer-term or more aggressive cut, as is typical \nwhen dropping a weight class, or certainly if you are dieting for a show, \nchanges should probably occur. \nSome very general guidelines are (you can modify the sample programs \nfrom the next chapter using this information as well):\n1.\t\nStep down one category of volume (e.g. from intermediate to\nnovice, or advanced to intermediate) to accommodate reduced\nrecovery. You probably don’t need to do this immediately, but\nmaybe at some point into the first third of a diet, it’s a good\nadjustment to make to ensure a better balance between stimulus\nand recovery (again, only if you’re dieting to unsustainable levels\nof leanness, or with a sizeable deficit).\n2.\t\nSwitch from doing deloads based on how you score on the\nchecklist, but to doing them automatically after every mesocycle\nto facilitate better recovery.\n3.\t\nUse the autoregulation strategies preceding this section so that\nyou can account for your performance being more variable.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n221\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve constructed a plan, added in elements \nof autoregulation, and adjusted it to your situation to better match it \nto your needs.\nHowever, it would be understandable if you still didn’t feel quite \ncomfortable writing a program just yet. To see in even greater detail how \nyou can apply these guidelines to program creation, in this chapter I’ve \ncreated sample novice, intermediate, and advanced programs for both \nstrength and hypertrophy (6 total programs) and I take you through \nthe entire progression plan for each one in detail.\nWarming Up\nThe purposes of a warm up is to prepare you for the training to come, \npotentially enhance the performance of training, and also to hopefully \nreduce the risk of injury. \nOne of the primary mechanisms by which a warm up provides these \nbenefits is an increase in body temperature, which has beneficial \nphysiological effects that include increasing muscle blood flow and \noxygen availability, and also increasing the speed and sensitivity of the \nneuromuscular system [1].\nWhile static stretching to enhance flexibility has been traditionally \nperformed as a part of a warm up [1], stretching to the point where \nflexibility is increased acutely prior to training can reduce muscular \nperformance [2–4]. If you think about it, making a muscle tendon unit \nmore compliant and forcing it to ‘relax’ so that it elongates, intuitively \nseems to conflict with the goal of making it contract against heavy \nloads. However, you could make an argument that this reduction in \nperformance may be worth it, since static stretching has also been \nproposed to reduce the risk of injury. Unfortunately, the data on whether \nor not static stretching reduces the occurrence of injury is mixed at \nbest [3, 5–7].\nThe likelihood that static stretching reduces the risk of injury is \ninconclusive, and if it does, it likely does not reduce injury risk to any \ngreater degree than an active or ‘dynamic’ warm up [6]. However, even \nif static stretching does not provide any additional benefit in regards to \ninjury prevention from what is provided by a dynamic warm up, there \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n222\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nmay be some individuals who find it necessary to improve flexibility \nprior to training in some cases. For example, if inflexible calves prevent \nthe completion of a full range of motion squat without coming up onto \nthe toes or causing premature ‘butt wink’ before you reach depth, it \nmay be advisable to attempt to increase calf flexibility prior to training. \nOther examples exist such as, tight pecs or shoulders preventing pain-\nfree positioning of the bar during low-bar squats, or tight triceps and \nforearms preventing pain-free positioning of the bar during front squats. \nIn these cases, static stretching prior to training may be a consideration \ndespite the potential to reduce the performance capability of the \nstretched muscle.\nThere are some ways to work around this potential conundrum. First, if you \nneed to increase the flexibility of a muscle group for exercise performance \nbut you aren’t training that muscle (such as the pecs and delts during low \nbar squats), feel free to statically stretch the muscle as this won’t degrade \nperformance. However, if you need to enhance the flexibility of a muscle \ngroup you are going to train, you have a few options.\n}\n} You can stretch for a short period of time (less than 60 seconds), \nand not to the point of discomfort as this appears to prevent any \ndecrease in muscular performance [2]. However, this is also unlikely \nto improve your flexibility very much.\n}\n} You can perform foam rolling, AKA ‘self-myofascial release’ (not \nthat this is actually ‘releasing’ fascia) on a muscle group, which has \nbeen shown to increase range of motion without decreasing force \nproduction [8].\n}\n} You can perform a dynamic, sport-specific warm up (which we will \ndiscuss in a moment) after static stretching which will likely negate \nany performance decrement due to static stretching [9].\nFinally, let’s clearly define what should be done for a complete warm up.\nArguably the most reasonable recommendation for a complete warm \nup is to perform submaximal-intensity aerobic activity followed by \ngeneral dynamic movement prep and then finish with sport-specific \ndynamic activities [4]. The purpose of the submaximal aerobic exercise \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n223\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nis to aid in increasing body temperature; however, personally, I find this \na bit redundant as a full-body dynamic movement prep also serves \nthis role. With that said, if you find you are slow to warm up, or if you \nexercise in a cold environment feel free to include it.\nThe full-body dynamic warm up should consist of full range of motion, \nexplosive movements to prepare you for the high force output resistance \ntraining to come, that in totality incorporates the entire body. Unlike \nstatic stretching that has the potential to degrade performance, a \ndynamic warm up has the potential to improve it [4].\nFinally, as a strength or physique athlete the ‘sport-specific’ warm up \nsimply consists of your warm-up sets on each lift.\nBelow is a sample warm up to perform before training (feel free to \nmodify it to your own preferences, there is not one “magic” warm up):\n5 Minutes Submaximal Aerobic Warm Up (Optional)\nSample Dynamic Warm Up\n10 Leg Swings Front to Back\n10 Leg Swings Side to Side\n10 Arm Circles Forward\n10 Arm Circles Backward\n10 Cross Body Arm Slaps\n10 Walking Lunges w/Trunk Rotation\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n224\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWorking Set Rep Target 1–5\nWorking Set Rep Target 6+\nReps\nLoad\nReps\nLoad\nSet 1\n5–10\nBar if \napplicable \n(optional)\nSet 1\n8\n50% \nWorking \nWeight\nSet 2\n5\n50% Working \nWeight\nSet 3\n4\n60% Working \nWeight\nSet 2\n4\n70% \nWorking \nWeight\nSet 4\n3\n70% Working \nWeight\nSet 5\n2\n80% Working \nWeight\nSet 3\n2\n90% \nWorking \nWeight\nSet 6\n1\n90% Working \nWeight\nOverview of Sample Programs\nAn Important Note on These Sample Programs\nBefore we get into the rationale for these programs and how to run through \nthem, it’s important to note that the primary purpose of these programs \nis actually not for you just to take them and use them exactly as written.\nBy definition, these programs cannot be optimal for you, because they \nare not specific to you and your needs. These programs can get close, \nas they allow you to match up your goal (powerlifting or bodybuilding) \nand your experience level (novice, intermediate, or advanced) to the \nprogram, and in some spots they allow you freedom to choose a \nvariation on an exercise or the schedule to fit your needs, but they still \naren’t true individualized programs.\nIndividuality is key to long-term success, and just like it’s not a good \nidea to use someone else’s diet regardless of whether your maintenance \ncalorie intake or initial body-fat percentage is similar to theirs or not, \nit’s also not a good idea to jump into a program regardless of how the \nvolume, intensity, or frequency of the program compares to what you \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n225\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nare currently adapted to.\nInstead of using these sample programs as “the be-all and end-all” that \nyou just jump right into, use them primarily as learning tools. These \nprograms are the synthesis of the entire Training Pyramid. They combine \nthe concepts presented throughout this book into usable systems. By \nexamining these sample programs you are looking at only a few of the \npossible iterations of the concepts embodied in this text. If you are a \ntrainer, you can use these sample programs to help you learn how to \ncreate customized programs for your clients, and if you are an athlete \nyou can use these programs to help you design a more individualized \nplan for yourself.\nThis overview section is fairly detailed. If you’re just looking to get started \nand the quick start guide didn’t get you all the way there, I’d suggest \nthat you just read the subsection that is relevant to you (powerlifter or \nbodybuilder, and novice, intermediate or advanced), and then skip to \nthe corresponding ‘Progression’ section and read through as you look \nat the Sample Program tables at the end.\nThe Novice Powerlifting Program Overview\nThe Novice Powerlifting Program is a three or four-day program built \naround developing skill and strength with the competition lifts, while also \ndeveloping a base of muscularity to aid further strength development. \nWhile it is true that programming is different for novice, intermediate \nand advanced lifters, you will see similarities in the structure and \norganization of the training program at each level. \nThe primary differences in programming between lifters of various \nexperience levels are the rate of progression that is attempted, the total \nvolume of work that is performed, and the structure of the program \nrelated to organizing these differences in volume. However, most of the \nother aspects of programming remain the same.\nAs a novice, complex approaches to periodization are not necessary \nto maximize the adaptive response. Thus, unlike the intermediate and \nadvanced programs, you won’t see the same elements of block or linear \nperiodization. Rather, a simple, single progression model where increases \nin load occur session to session is used. However, that doesn’t mean \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n226\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ntraining should completely lack variety and be highly monotonous.\nYou will see that the program is built on the framework of a daily undulating \nmodel where hypertrophy,‘power (essentially heavy technique work), \nand strength are trained. Strength is achieved through the combination \nof larger muscle fibers increasing force production, neuromuscular \nadaptations increasing force production and the optimization of technique \nthat allows for a more efficient expression of the force produced.\nAdditionally, training with a lack of variation in load or volume is not only \npsychologically monotonous but also has been shown to increase the \nchance of overtraining, degrade performance, increase the frequency of \nillness; and when training that is highly monotonous (little variation in load \nand volume) is made less monotonous, increases in performance occur [10].\nFor these reasons, different rep and load combinations are used on \ndifferent days.\n}\n} If you use the three-day version, Day 1 is dedicated to higher-\nrep, moderate-load work to accumulate a relatively high volume \n(hypertrophy). Day 2 is dedicated to low-rep, moderately-heavy \nwork at a low volume on bench (power) and low-rep heavy work at \na low volume on deadlift (strength). Day 3 is dedicated to low-rep, \nheavy work at a moderate volume on squat and bench (strength).\n}\n} If you use the four-day version, the structure is the same, except \nonly the main lifts are trained on Days 1 through 3, while Day 4 is \ndedicated to accessory work.\n}\n} If you have no issue with the cumulative fatigue of performing \nthe main lifts first and don’t mind dedicating more time to longer \ntraining sessions, go with the three-day version. If you would prefer \nshorter training sessions but one more session per week or find that \nthe fatigue of the main lifts is detrimental to your accessory work, \nchoose the four-day option.\nThe volume performed for specific individual muscle groups is not nearly \nas important a consideration as it would be for a bodybuilding program. \nFor this reason, all the powerlifting programs are expressed in terms of \ntotal lower-body, upper-body push, and upper-body pull volume.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n227\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe volume is established at the lower end of the weekly volume \nper muscle group recommendations made in Level 2 and follows the \ntraining age specific recommendations from the quick start guide. The \nvolume is also split up so that ~⅔ of the volume is heavy work, while \nthe rest is lighter, and just over half of the volume is performed with the \ncompetition lifts while the rest is performed using accessory lifts.\nThe breakdown for the Novice Powerlifting Program is shown below \n(deadlift and deadlift variant volume is counted towards lower-body \nand upper-body pull volume).\nMovement \nCategory\nSets/\nWk\nExercise\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nMain Lift \nIntensity\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nUB Push\n12\nMain\n18\n56%\n≤6 reps/\nset\n12\n67%\nUB Pull\n11\nAccessory\n14\n44%\n> 6 reps/\nset\n6\n33%\nLower\n12\nTotal\n32\n100%\nTotal\n18\n100%\nThe Intermediate Powerlifting Program Overview\nThe Intermediate Powerlifting Program is a four-day program that \nbuilds upon the base that was established from the novice program. \nVolume is increased globally, with a greater increase coming in the \nform of lower-body and upper-body pushing volume. Additionally, a \nsecond horizontal pull (I advise a free weight option for the heavier \nrowing session) and a bench and squat variation are added to round \nout development and ensure that no “weak links in the chain” occur \nnow that the foundations of technical skill have been established.\nFour days are utilized to accommodate the increased volume. Unlike \nthe novice program there is no three-day option.\nHeavy loading accounts for 70% of the volume while lighter loading \naccounts for 30%. Similarly, nearly the same proportion of volume comes \nfrom the competition lifts and accessory movements, respectively.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n228\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nA daily undulating model is still the approach used on a week-to-week \nbasis in a similar manner to the novice program. Higher volumes of \nmoderate-intensity work are performed on Day 1 with a squat variation \n(I advise a variation that allows you to say upright to give your hips a \nbreak if you squat low bar, e.g. front, high bar, or safety bar squat) and \nbench press. Accessory movements are trained for both strength and \nhypertrophy on all days, and Day 2 is dedicated to heavy technique \nwork with the competition lifts. Strength work is spread between Day \n3 and 4 with squats and bench press being trained for strength on \nDay 3, and then the deadlift trained for strength on Day 4 with some \nmoderate load work on a bench variation (if you bench wide, I advise \na close grip variation, or you can do a weak point specific variation —\nsee Level 4). Ideally to allow recovery between heavy competition lift \ntraining, place a day off between Day 3 and 4 if possible.\nAs an intermediate, a periodized approach to progression is utilized \nrather than the single-factor progression model that was used as a \nnovice. A linear periodization model is utilized in a wave loading format \nfor all lifts on a week to week basis.\nSavvy readers will realize that they can create versions of this \nprogram geared more towards accumulating volume or more towards \nintensification (determined by the time point in the season) by simply \nincreasing or decreasing the rep range and loads. For example:\n}\n} To make this program more volume focused a lift performed for 3 \nto 5 repetitions at 82.5 to 87.5% of 1RM could instead be performed \nfor 4 to 6 repetitions at 80 to 85% of 1RM.\n}\n} To make this program more intensity focused, a lift performed for 3 \nto 5 repetitions at 82.5 to 87.5% of 1RM could instead be performed \nfor 2 to 4 repetitions at 85 to 90% of 1RM.\nThe breakdown of the Intermediate Powerlifting Program is shown in \nthe following table.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n229\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe Advanced Powerlifting Program Overview\nThe Advanced Powerlifting Program continues to build upon the \nqualities that the lifter has developed over the earlier phases of his \nor her career as a novice and as an intermediate. A daily undulating \nframework is once again utilized and now training is spread out over \nsix days to accommodate the increases in volume that are required for \ncontinued adaptation at this stage of the lifter’s career.\nAdditionally, the program is split into distinct block-periodized mesocycles, \nwhere the lifter has distinct periods of training focused on the desired \nadaptation so that more efficient adaptations occur over the long term.\nWithin and over the course of the block-periodized mesocyles, \nelements of linear periodization are also utilized. Changes in intensity \nand repetitions follow a wave loading model similar to the intermediate \nprogram and specificity increases over the course of the entire program.\nThe accumulation cycle emphasizes the use of more accessory \nmovements, higher repetition ranges, and lower intensities. On the \nwhole, the goal is to encourage hypertrophy and work capacity \nadaptations to set the lifter up for the subsequent intensification cycle.\nHalf the training volume comes from the competition lifts while \naccessory work makes up the remaining half. Likewise, roughly 56% of \nthe repetitions performed are in the heavier loading range while ~44% \nare performed with lighter loads.\nThe breakdown for the accumulation block is shown in the following \ntable.\nMovement \nCategory\nSets/\nWk\nExercise\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nMain Lift \nIntensity\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nUB Push\n15\nMain\n27\n69%\n≤6 reps/\nset\n19\n70%\nUB Pull\n15\nAccessory\n12\n31%\n> 6 reps/\nset\n8\n30%\nLower\n15\nTotal\n39\n100%\nTotal\n27\n100%\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n230\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe intensification block is marked by a global decrease in volume \nload and repetitions via reductions in reps per set and dropping some \naccessory work, and an increase in intensity. The number of training \ndays remains the same and the rep ranges decrease while the loads \nincrease in the intensification block.\nThe linear periodization model is still apparent week to week, albeit \nwith lower repetitions and higher loads. Finally, many of the accessory \nmovements drop away, while the frequency and the proportion of the \nvolume of the competition lifts increases.\nIn contrast to the accumulation block, now the emphasis becomes \nmore specific with 75% of the volume performed using the competition \nlifts and the remaining 25% is performed with accessory movements. \nLikewise, just over 80% of the main lift sets fall in the heavier loading \nzone while just under 20% are performed with lighter loads. While the \naccumulation and intensification phases individually stray towards the \nends of the Level 2 VIF guidelines, the advanced program as a whole \nfalls right smack in the middle of them.\nThe stats for the intensification block are as follows.\nMovement \nCategory\nSets/\nWk\nExercise\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nMain Lift \nIntensity\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nUB Push\n21\nMain\n27\n50%\n≤6 reps/\nset\n15\n56%\nUB Pull\n15\nAccessory\n27\n50%\n> 6 reps/\nset\n12\n44%\nLower\n18\nTotal\n54\n100%\nTotal\n27\n100%\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n231\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nvThe Novice Bodybuilding Program, unlike the Novice Powerlifting\nProgram, does not have a three day option. This is a four day program, \nand it has more exercises to ensure all muscle groups are adequately \ntrained and has a higher total volume compared to the Novice \nPowerlifting Program. In all of the bodybuilding programs, unlike the \npowerlifting programs, volume is not only considered in relation to \nlower body, and upper body push and pull, but rather for each specific \nmuscle group. Thus, they have been designed to ensure complete, \nsymmetrical development over time.\nThe framework of the Novice Bodybuilding Program is still that of an \nundulating model; however, there is no “power” or heavy technique \nwork performed because this is not a primary concern for a physique \nathlete. Instead, there are days focused on accumulating volume to \nstimulate hypertrophy, and also days focused on building strength. \nStrength development complements the accumulation of volume and \naids hypertrophy by encouraging progressive overload and allowing \nheavier loads and greater mechanical tension to be applied over time.\nBecause skill development is not as important to a bodybuilder as it is \nto a powerlifter, and because greater volumes are performed on each \nday, a lower/upper split is used to balance out fatigue and recovery \nacross the week. Similarly to the Novice Powerlifting Program, a single \nfactor progression of load is used on a week to week basis.\nRoughly 65% of the volume in this program is accumulated using \nmoderate rep ranges and moderate loads, while the remaining 35% \nis dedicated to heavier loads paired with lower rep ranges and lighter \nMovement \nCategory\nSets/\nWk\nExercise\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nMain Lift \nIntensity\nSets/\nWk\n% of \nTotal\nUB Push\n20\nMain\n36\n75%\n≤6 reps/\nset\n29\n81%\nUB Pull\n13\nAccessory\n12\n25%\n> 6 reps/\nset\n7\n19%\nLower\n22\nTotal\n48\n100%\nTotal\n36\n100%\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n232\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nloads paired with higher rep ranges. The sets per muscle group largely \nfall between 10–12, as per the guidelines in the program quick start \nchapter; however, you’ll notice that calves and hams fall just short, \nwhile glutes exceed those guidelines. Remember, both squat and hip \nhinge patterns train the glutes, so they get worked in the majority of \ncompound lower body movements and you’ll notice a pattern of their \nvolume being higher for this reason. Also, while the hamstrings aren’t \ntrained effectively in squat and single leg patterns, they are trained to \nsome degree. Calves are also trained to some degree on both leg curls, \nsquat (and single leg) pattern movements, so their volumes appear \ndeceptively lower than the actual stimulus.\nThe breakdown for the Novice Bodybuilding Program is as follows.\nUpper \nBody\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\n% of \nTotal\nPecs\n11\nQuads\n11\n6–12 reps/\nset\n36\n65%\nBack\n10\nGlutes\n14\nOther\n19\n35%\nAnt.

Additionally, the progression is changed \nto be more suitable to an intermediate level lifter and follows a \nlinear-periodized, wave-loading pattern in the same manner as the \nIntermediate Powerlifting Program.\nThe framework is similar to that of the Novice Bodybuilding Program \nin that the week starts off with strength focused training on Day 1 \nand 2 in a lower and upper-body format. However, for the rest of the \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n233\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nweek muscle groups are organized in a three-day split. Lower body, \npush, and pull are performed in that order, after the lower and upper \nbody training sessions on Day 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, this is a five-\nday program; however, the frequency per body part remains at two \ntimes per week like the novice program. The change from four days of \ntraining in the novice program to five days in the intermediate program \nallows for more volume to be performed per muscle group, while also \nspreading the additional workload over more days in the week to allow \nfor recovery.\nThe proportion of volume from moderate loads relative to heavier and \nlighter loads that was present in the Novice Bodybuilding Program is \nretained in the Intermediate Bodybuilding Program. Volume largely \nfalls within the 10–20 set/wk range for all muscle groups, and mostly \nlands in the ranges suggested for intermediates in the program building \nchapter. However, arm volume is higher due to the increase in total \nupper body pushing and pulling volume. With that said, most of the \nadded arm volume is indirect, so this disproportionately makes arm \nvolume seem high. Likewise, with additional pressing, anterior delts \nare trained more. This is an unavoidable outcome from doing more \ncompound movements (and a reason I almost never include front raises \nin programs). Lastly, as described in the Novice Bodybuilding Program \ndescription, glute volume is also high.\nThe breakdown for the Intermediate Bodybuilding Program is on the \nnext page.\nThe Advanced Bodybuilding Program Overview\nThe Advanced Bodybuilding Program continues the increase in \nvolume from the intermediate program, like the intermediate \nprogram did in comparison to the novice. Similarly, to accommodate \nthis increase in volume, the number of days per week is increased \nto six, so that less volume can be performed per session while still \nincreasing total work.\nThis program returns to the lower/upper division of muscle groups, this \ngrouping is performed three times in a week. Meaning, three lower-\nbody days and three upper- body days are alternated and performed \neach week for a total of six training sessions.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n234\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nThe linear-periodized model of progression is performed in a similar \nmanner to the intermediate program; however, a block periodized model \nis also integrated in the same fashion as the advanced powerlifting \nprogram. Also, the daily undulating model is emphasized to help \norganize the training stress of the week.\nMuch like the modified daily-undulating model in which “power” is \nperformed after hypertrophy to allow for recovery before the final \nstrength session is performed, the first two days of this program are \nhigher reps, volume, and RPE and the next two are sessions with lower \ntotal volume and relative intensities and the final two sessions of the \nweek are dedicated to strength. While “power”, or what amounts to \nheavy technique work, is not performed like it is in the powerlifting \nprograms, the concept of having a training day that allows recovery, \nbefore heavy loads have to be lifted, is utilized.\nThe accumulation and intensification blocks in the Advanced \nBodybuilding Program are very similar to one another and have less \ndisparity than the blocks in the Advanced Powerlifting Program. \nExercise selection remains the same, and the only differences are \nthat the repetition ranges decrease while the loads increase in the \nintensification block relative to the accumulation block. Volume load \nand total reps are higher in the accumulation phase and more repetitions \nare performed in the moderate intensity range, while volume load and \ntotal reps are slightly lower and more repetitions are performed in the \nheavier loading zones in the intensification phase.\nUpper \nBody\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\n% of \nTotal\nPecs\n13\nQuads\n13\n6–12 reps/\nset\n51\n65%\nBack\n15\nGlutes\n20\nOther\n28\n35%\nAnt.

However, more \nsets in the intensification block are below the 6–20 range such that the \nhypertrophy-stimulating volume is slightly lower in the intensification \nblock. With that said, with heavier loads in the intensification block, \nit would be a mistake to try to compensate by increasing sets. The \ncombination of heavier loads and more sets would cause excessive \nfatigue. Finally, you’ll see the trends in volume distribution per body \npart continue from the intermediate program with arms, glutes and \nanterior delts with higher volumes due to their indirect involvement in \nmany exercises, deceptively low volume for calves (remember indirect \nwork from leg curls and squat patterns), and a general increase across \nthe board to match up with the recommendations from the quick start \nguide.\nThe breakdown of the accumulation block is as follows.\nUpper \nBody\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\nIntensity\nSets/Wk\n% of \nTotal\nPecs\n17\nQuads\n16\n6–12 reps/\nset\n66\n69%\nBack\n17\nGlutes\n24\nOther\n29\n31%\nAnt.

This will \nrequire strength testing prior to starting this program. However, do \ntrack your RPE on each set to get familiar with self-assessing how close \nyou are to failure after each set (use video and/or coach feedback to \nhelp you learn this skill).\n(Consider having a reread of the “Measuring Intensity” section in the \nVolume, Intensity, Frequency Level now for a quick recap on what we \nmean by RPE and RIR.)\nAs a novice, ensure you have received skilled coaching on how to \nproperly perform the exercises you will use.\nEstablishing Initial Maxes\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n237\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n}\n} On the exercises with a percentage of 1RM listed, perform a 3–5RM \nunder supervision from a skilled, experienced lifter or coach, and \nhave spotters. Then, use our website’s 1RM calculator to estimate \nyour 1RM. For powerlifters starting the novice program, a 1RM \ntest is certainly acceptable given this is something you’ll do in \ncompetition, but do have spotters. Remember, the novice programs \nare for novice bodybuilders and novice powerlifters, rather than \ncomplete novices to the weight room. For complete novices, no \nmax testing of any type needs to be performed. Simply start with \nlight to moderate loads, work on perfecting technique and progress \nloads each session while working on form for a few weeks until your \nbasic fundamental lifting skills are established. Then, this approach \ncan be followed.\n}\n} For squats and deadlifts (and variants like the front squat or RDL), \ndo your AMRAP or 1RM to technical failure, not absolute failure. \nThese movements when performed incorrectly not only change the \nmuscles that are emphasized but also risk injury. Thus, loads must \nbe based on your estimated max with solid execution to ingrain \ngood technique.\n}\n} For any exercise where a %1RM is not listed, I don’t advise max testing. \nThese exercises are difficult for novices to perform without losing \nform when loads are very heavy. Rather, you will use RPE from the \nstart, which will also serve as a learning tool. These exercises require \nthe coordination of fewer movements, are low risk, and even if you \ninitially gauge RPE inaccurately, there will be little to no consequences \nin terms of under or overtraining in the grand scheme.\n}\n} You’ll notice the RPE values for the novice programs are always “First \nSet RPE 8”. Meaning, you should be able to do all the prescribed \nsets for the day by sticking with your initial set’s load if it matched \nup correctly with the target RPE (close to an 8 RPE). If you “miss \nreps” on subsequent sets at the same load as the RPE climbs past \n10, you either started too heavy, didn’t rest long enough, or perhaps \nmade a technical fault; all of which are learning experiences for \nyour next session. \n}\n} Some tips to get better with RPE: 1) Even on your main lifts where \nyou are using % 1RM, write down an RPE just to get familiar with \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n238\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nrating RPE, 2) record your sets on your phone and/or get feedback \nfrom an experienced training partner or coach if they are present. \nConsult the video and/or consider the feedback, and use it with \nyour assessment of how the set felt to determine your RPE/RIR. \nWith maxes established, let’s dive into the program.\nThe First Week of Training\nAlright, so here I’m going to talk you through how to take your initial maxes \nand use them with the notations in the spreadsheet. It’s actually quite \nsimple, but it might be confusing at first when you’re unfamiliar with it.\nFor instructional purposes, even if you are a bodybuilder, I am going \nto walk you through the “Novice Powerlifting Sample Program” so you \nunderstand how these programs work. You can refer to the table at \nthe end of the book as I talk you through it. Just in case you’re reading \nthis on a device that makes it a trouble to skip back and forth between \npages, here is day one.\nDay 1\nExercise\nSets\nReps\n%1RM\n1st Set RPE\nSquat\n3\n8\n70%\nNA\nBench\n3\n8\n70%\nNA\nVert Pull\n4\n10\nNA\n8\nYou can see that we have three exercises on this first training day.\n}\n} Exercise/sets/reps: The first exercise is the squat.

For your first set aim to hit this target \nso subsequent sets are not too difficult such that they result in \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n239\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nfailure. For the exercises without an RPE, just use the percentage of \n1RM, but still record RPE (only adjust the load if you actually can’t \ncomplete the reps). As you gain more experience, you’ll get better \nat accurately rating your RPE which will help you as you’ll eventually \nuse RPE to adjust your loads regularly (see advanced progression).\nSo, let’s say that your current 1RM in the squat is 180 lb (~80 kg). You’ll \nload the bar so that the total weight is 70% of that, 125 lb (57.5 kg) and \nthen perform 3 sets of 8. This might feel relatively easy, but resist the \ntemptation to do more. Some people can get substantially more than \n8 reps at this percentage, but our goal is to be submaximal as you’ll \nbe making linear increases in load every time you repeat this session. \nYour second and third sets you will more than likely find to be a harder \nthan the first due to cumulative fatigue. Move onto the next exercise, \nthe bench press.\nNow, let’s say your 1RM for the bench press is actually a little higher \nthan the squat, 200 lb (~90 kg). It is not an uncommon situation for \nmany ,typically male, lifters to be more proficient and stronger at bench \npressing than squatting when they first get serious about powerlifting. \nHave no fear if this is your situation, it will be corrected quickly. Load \nthe bar so that the total weight is 70% of that, 140 lb (~62.5 kg) and \nthen perform 3 sets of 8.\nAfter you have completed all three sets move onto the Vertical Pull (this \ncan be chin-ups if you are strong enough to do 10 at an 8 RPE, or a cable \nor machine pulldown). After doing your warm-up sets, make your best \nguess at what weight you think you could do for 12 reps, and do a set \nof 10 (meaning, 10 reps at an 8 RPE). Repeat this for all three remaining \nsets. Don’t worry if the first set or the whole session ended up being way \ntoo easy, you can increase the load on your following sets or sessions, \nrespectively. Also don’t worry if you overshot and missed reps, just \nreduce the load on subsequent sets. When you get more experience, \nyou’ll be able to pick a load you can do for all your sets on the exercise \nwith the last set getting harder, but not so hard you can’t complete all 10 \nreps. At this point, you can make small jumps each week in load.\nIf you are performing the Novice Bodybuilding Program, the process is \nalmost exactly the same, except the exercise selection differs. Also, on \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n240\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nDays 2, 3, and 4 there are opportunities to use Antagonist Paired Sets \n(APS, see Level 5). You can use APS on horizontal and vertical push \nand pulls, triceps and biceps, and leg curls and extensions on Days 2 \nthrough 4. As a general reminder, if you are unsure about how long to \nrest between sets or how to do APS see Level 5 again briefly.\nProgression Rules (After The First Training Week)\nNow, with this first week out of the way, it’s time to make linear increases in \nload. You saw a simple example of these progression rules in action in the \n“Example Novice Progression Using 5x5” table of the Progression Level. \nHave a look back at that now to refresh yourself before reading further.\nDone? Ok, let’s continue.\nTreat each day as a separate progression on a week to week basis, \nmeaning the load used on Day 1 has no bearing on the load you use on \nDay 2, rather, Day 1 is compared to Day 1 of the previous week.\nFor the Novice Powerlifting Program, start by increasing the load by 10 \nlb (~5 kg) on the squat and deadlift each week, and increase the load by \n5 lb (~2.5 kg) on the bench press. For accessories, use the next smallest \nincrement available. For the Novice Bodybuilding Program use the \nsame progressions but, use 10 lb (~5 kg) increases on squat, deadlift, \nhip hinge and leg press variants, and 5 lb (~2.5 kg) load increases (or the \nsmallest possible increment on non-barbell lifts) on all other exercises.\nOn exercises with a first set RPE target, if you selected your load \nproperly, you should be able to complete your final set with the same \nload without missing reps (if you’re completely new to lifting, don’t \nworry if this is difficult to gauge initially). If you cannot complete all the \nreps on the final set (or previous sets), you started with a load that was \ntoo heavy or didn’t rest long enough.\nFinally, try not to perform reps to true failure at this stage of your \nlifting career. Specifically, do not perform reps on squats and their \nvariants, deadlifts and their variants, bench press and other pressing \nmovements, OHP, front squat or RDL beyond technical failure. As a \nnovice, you may be able to do more reps by allowing form to deviate, \nbut this will hurt you in the long run. If you watch IPF worlds, and see \nworld-class lifters, you’ll notice the only difference between 1st and \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n241\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n3rd attempts, is a slower bar speed in most cases. When you get really \ngood at lifting, you shouldn’t be able to alter form to get more reps, \ntechnical and absolute failure become the same thing. You will only get \nto this point by ingraining good habits though.\nAs per the novice progression, if you cannot complete all sets and reps \nas assigned with the same load, do not increase the load on the same \nday the next week, attempt the same weights again.\nIf you go two weeks in a row and do not get your target repetitions, \ndecrease the load by 10% the next week on the same day. Then the week \nafter, return to the load you were previously stalled with (see page 39 for \nexample). If you then stall once again, use the same progression pattern, \nbut start increasing the load only half as much week to week as you were \npreviously. Meaning, if the lift is squat, deadlift, leg press, or a hip hinge, \nmake load increases of 5 lb (~2.5 kg) versus 10 lb (~5 kg). If the lift is bench \npress or any other exercise, switch to micro-loading if you have the plates \navailable; using 2 lb (~1 kg) increases per week (if you don’t have access to \nmicro plates, simply increase the load every other session).\nRepeat the process of increasing, maintaining, or decreasing load \nbased on whether you get all the reps, don’t get all the reps for one \nsession or don’t get all the reps for two sessions in a row, respectively. \nIf you have to decrease load even after the 10% reset, and switching \nto smaller increment increases (5 vs 10 lb or 2.5 kg vs 5 kg) on the \nmajority of your lifts, it is time to move on to an intermediate approach \nto training and progression. As a final note, remember your bench \npress on Day 2 where you start with three reps at 80% is meant to be \na technique building day. It should always be a good 4–6 reps from \nfailure, so don’t wait for this day’s progression so stall out before going \nto the intermediate progression. If your heavy days (Day 3 and 4) have \nstalled even after dropping down to 5 lb (~2.5 kg) load increases, it’s \ntime to move on.\nIntermediate Progression\nRPE Based on RIR is Primarily Used to Set Load\nNow with some weight training experience under your belt, RPE based \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n242\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\non RIR can be more accurately used; you should be able to tell with \nreasonable accuracy how many reps you have in the tank. For this \nreason, load selection is based on the first Set RPE on all lifts, and \n%1RM is used as a reference. In the bodybuilding program this is really \nstraightforward, everything is a first set RPE of 8. This is a good starting \nRPE that should prevent you from hitting failure if you maintain load \nfor your subsequent sets, but also keeps effort high.\nFor the powerlifting program, you’ll see on Day 1 on the main lifts \nand their variants first set RPE is a 7. This is to ensure you don’t hit \nfailure as you do multiple sets to keep form pristine and to minimize \nmuscle damage from bleeding into subsequent days where you have \nto perform the lifts again. Likewise, on Day 2 you have first set RPEs \non the 'big 3' lifts, of 5. This is your technique building day and this \nday should always be 4–6 reps shy of failure as we are looking to focus \non form with “heavyish” loads, versus inducing fatigue. However, your \nstrength work on Days 3 and 4 and accessory work have first set RPEs \nof 8, meaning you can push these movements more and this is where \nyou should be challenging yourself. \nProgression Rules\nFollow the intermediate, wave loading progression model in the \n“Progressing As An Intermediate” section of the Progression Level for \nall lifts in the Intermediate Powerlifting Program, and all lifts except for \nthe isolation exercises in the Intermediate Bodybuilding Program.\nIntensity will go up over the course of a three week cycle, while \nvolume will come down. When you see the % 1RM range listed, this is \na reference value that should put you roughly around the first set RPE, \nand highest % 1RM corresponds to the lowest rep wave. For example, in \nthe Intermediate Powerlifting Program on Day 1, Bench is listed as 7 to \n9 reps at 67.5-72.5% 1RM. Thus, you might do 9 reps at ~67.5% in week \n1 (the percentages are just an estimate of what will result in the target \nRPE remember), 8 reps at ~70% in week 2, and 7 reps at ~72.5% in week \n3 (assuming this resulted in a first set RPE 7 in week 1, if not you’d go \nheavier or lighter as needed in week 1).\nLike the novice program, each day of each week is progressed \nindependently, meaning, you will not compare Day 1 to Day 2 or Day 2 \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n243\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nto Day 3, but each exercise progression continues from the same day \nthe previous week.\nAfter hitting the target first set RPE in week 1, for squats, deadlifts, and \nvariations in the powerlifting program, use 10 lb (5 kg) increases in load \neach week as reps decrease. For all other movements, use 5 lb (2.5 \nkg) increases each week. For the bodybuilding program, use the same \nincreases for squat, deadlift, hip hinge, and leg press variants, and then \nall other exercises, respectively.\nDo the deload assessment (the checklist is in the quick start chapter for \nreference) after every three-week wave loading pattern is completed. If \nneeded, implement a 4th-week deload before starting the next heavier \nwave load. Use the lowest number of reps and the lowest load you used \nin the prior 3 weeks during the deload, while performing two-thirds \nas many sets. If on regular weeks you performed 3 or 4 sets on the \nexercise, during the deload, perform 2, and if you performed 5 or 6 sets \non regular weeks, perform 3 sets during the deload. So for example, if \nyou performed 6x3 with 200 lb on bench press on Week 1 Day 2, 6x2 \nwith 205 lb on Week 2 Day 2, and 6x1 with 210 lb on Week 3 Day 2, then \nyou would perform 4x1 with 200 lb on Week 4 Day 2 for your deload.\nThe next three-week cycle begins 10 lb (5 kg) heavier or 5 lb (2.5 kg) \nheavier (depending on the exercise) and you repeat the pattern again.\nFor the isolation exercises in the Intermediate Bodybuilding Program, \nuse the “Double Progression” model and deload it as outlined along \nwith the other lifts if the deload is required. Remember, if you make it \nthrough three wave loading cycles (9 weeks) without deloading, do a \ndeload regardless of your score on the checklist just to be sure.\nLike the novice progression, we don’t want to miss reps, it should only \noccasionally occur in pursuit of the planned progression on your final \nsets. This will happen as you push the limits of your strength week to \nweek and cycle to cycle.\nWhen selecting loads, once again choose a load that lines up with the \nfirst set RPE target provided, so as to give yourself room to progress and \nto account for cumulative fatigue from multiple sets. This way you will \navoid hitting failure initially when performing multiple sets and extend \nyour ability to progress. If you struggle to add reps using as narrow of \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n244\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\na repetition range as provided without hitting failure, extend the range \nby a rep on either side. So for example, 3–5 becomes 2–6, 4–6 becomes, \n3–7, 5–7 becomes 4–8, and 6–8 becomes 5–9. Meaning, your cycle length \nwill extend, as it takes three weeks to drop from 8’s, to 7’s, to 6’s, while it \ntakes five to drop from 9’s, to 8’s, to 7’s, to 6’s, to 5’s. If you extend your \nranges, deloads become mandatory every two cycles instead of three.\nAlso, the 8–12 range is wave loaded in this book with two rep increment \ndrops for intermediates; i.e. 12, 10, 8. If you extend the range, you need \nto, therefore, add two reps a side to the range (6–14), so you’d be on \nthe same pattern as your single rep drop wave loaded exercises (3–5, \n4–6, 6–8, etc.). You’d make two rep increment drops; i.e. 14, 12, 10, 8, \nthen 6 to line up with the rest, and remember deloads are mandatory \nevery two cycles with this extension versus three. \nWhen Unable to Progress in Any Given Exercise\nOver time, if you are unable to complete the progression as outlined on \na given exercise:\n}\n} Finish the current 3-week cycle in which you are stalled by decreasing \nloads as needed so that all sets and reps are completed.\n}\n} Take the deload in Week 4 regardless of your checklist score to \nmake sure fatigue is controlled for, on all exercises.\n}\n} After the deload, in the first week of your next cycle, select a load \nthat you will be able to complete the wave loading pattern with for \nthat exercise you stalled on (5–10% lighter than the load you stalled \nwith on the week or weeks you stalled).\n}\n} Then, after the cycle is complete and for each successive cycle make \na smaller load increase.\nLike the novice progression plan, after you stall, reduce the rate of \nprogression, so that instead of increasing the load by 10 lb (5 kg), you \nincrease the load by 5 lb (2.5 kg) — you could microload as well if you \nhad access making the increments even smaller but this typically makes \nsubsequent weeks too easy when dropping reps week to week. If you \nstall once more and are unable to progress your loads on most lifts every \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n245\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\ncycle by even 5 lb (2.5 kg), it is time to consider an advanced approach \nto training and progression. Again, like the Novice Powerlifting Program’s \nbench “power” training on Day 2, on Day 2 of the Intermediate Powerlifting \nProgram, you should not wait to stall on this day’s lifts as they are intended \nto remain submaximal throughout. Base your decision to change to the \nadvanced progression when you stall on your strength days.\nModifications to Peak for a Powerlifting Competition\nTo use the Intermediate Powerlifting Program as part of a meet prep \nplan to peak for competition, we will combine it with the approach \nshown at the end of Level 3.\nTo set it up, start a 4-week cycle 4 weeks out from a meet. Then, simply \nchange the rep range on the squat and bench on Day 3, and deadlift on \nDay 4 from 3–5 to 1–3.\nStarting Week 3, the week prior to your competition, begin a deload on \nyour accessory lifts — all lifts that are not the competition lifts (including \nsquat, bench and deadlift variants). This is a week earlier than usual.\nAdditionally, swap the bench variant on Day 4 with the bench on Day \n3, and move Day 3’s squats to Day 4. Thus on Day 4, you will perform \nsquat, bench, and deadlift in order. However, instead of performing \nmultiple reps for singles, doubles or triples (remember we changed \nthe rep range to 1–3), you will simply work up to your opener, for 1 rep.\nThe week of the competition, include a deload for the rest of your lifts \nas well (the competition lifts), and on Day 3 just work up to 2 singles at \na 4 RPE on squat and bench press and 1 single at a 4 RPE on deadlift, \ndoing nothing else. Perform Day 3 24–48 hours prior to your meet as \na priming session (this may help meet day performance [11]). Then, of \ncourse, Day 4 is replaced with the competition itself.\nIf you were wondering why there was not a novice competition \npreparation plan, it’s because a novice should wait until they are \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n246\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nintermediates before they begin competing.\nAdvanced Progression\nUsing RPE Ranges\nIn the advanced programs, you’ll see RPE ranges instead of the “first \nset RPE” which was used in the novice and intermediate programs. \nAt this stage, you should be well aware of how much you have left in \nthe tank, and you should be able to be objective and accurate. Thus, \nas described in Level 2, you’ll use the percentage 1RM guideline for \nyour first set (unless you are very confident it would put you outside \nof the RPE range), and then based on the RPE of that set, modify \nyour subsequent sets up or down to fall within the given range.  This \nserves two purposes, 1) it allows you to have a more individualized \nload assignment and, 2) it allows you to see if you are getting stronger \nwithout necessarily running AMRAPs or 1RM tests (although I’ve set \nthe programs up so you can do that if desired).\nOverview\nThe advanced program has two different 3-week mesocycles; an \naccumulation block, and an intensity block. The volume starts high and \nthen decreases week to week while intensity increases. As outlined in Level \n3, after each block assess if you need a deload using the deload checklist \n(see Level 3 or the Quick Start guide). If a deload is needed, repeat week \n3 but with ⅔ the sets, RPE ranges 1 point lower and percentage 1RMs \n5% less. Remember, if you finish three training blocks without running \na deload, run one just in case. Additionally, there is a competition taper \nlisted for powerlifters and a testing week listed for bodybuilders.\nFor Powerlifters\nDepending on how advanced you are, you can run 2–4 cycles of the blocks \nin isolation, or in a combined fashion. Then, if desired, you can perform \n1RM or AMRAP testing on the main lifts. If you are early in the season \nand many months prior to a competition you could run back to back \naccumulation blocks followed by AMRAP testing (or just gauge if you are \ngetting stronger via observing if loads are increasing at the same RPEs).\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n247\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nIf you are further along in the year but not peaking for a competition, \nyou can run 1–2 accumulation blocks followed by 1–2 intensity blocks \nand finish with 1RM testing on the main lifts. But again, as discussed in \nLevel 3 you don’t have to actually run testing. Since you will be using \nRPE to adjust load throughout the program, you’ll be able to see if you \nare getting stronger.\nIf you do want to test strength after an accumulation block with AMRAP \ntesting, run a deload as described above (repeating week 3 but ⅔ the \nnumber of sets, RPE ranges 1 lower and percentage 1RM 5% less) but \nmodify the deload week as follows:\n1.\t\nPerform Day 1 as normal per the deload guidelines.\n2.\t\nOn Day 2 do an AMRAP at 85% (or just try to set a new 4–6RM)\non your vertical push (or run it as deload if you don’t test this lift)\nand perform your HH variant and triceps per deload guidelines.\n3.\t\nPerform Day 3 and Day 4 as normal per the deload guidelines.\n4.\t Skip Day 5.\n5.\t Replace Day 6 with AMRAPs at 85% (or just try to set a new\n4–6RM) on the competition lifts.\nIf you do want to test strength after an intensification block with 1RM \ntesting, run a deload as described above but modify the deload week \nas follows:\n1.\t\nPerform Day 1 as normal per the deload guidelines.\n2.\t\nOn Day 2 do an AMRAP at 90% (or just try to set a new 3–5RM)\non your vertical push (or run it as deload if you don’t test this lift)\nand perform your HH variant per deload guidelines.\n3.\t\nPerform Day 3 and Day 4 as normal per the deload guidelines.\n4.\t Skip Day 5.\n5.\t Replace Day 6 with a mock meet, performing 3 attempts on each\ncompetition lift in hopes of setting new 1RMs.\nIf you are peaking for a competition: \n1.\t\nRun an accumulation block.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n248\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\n2.\t\nFollow it with an intensity block.\n3.\t\nFollow it with a modified deload week like you would if you were\ngoing to do 1RM testing, following the first four steps above.\n4.\t Replace Day 6 with opener practice, working up to your opener\nattempts on each competition lift. These should be between 87.5–\n92.5% of your current 1RM (which you might not know if you’ve\ngotten stronger), but should fall in the range of a 7.5–8.5 RPE. This\nday should occur 1 week out.\n5.\t Run the competition taper the week of the meet, it’s listed after\nthe intensification block.\nFor Bodybuilders\nBodybuilders have a very similar setup in that there are accumulation and \nintensification blocks of the same length as the powerlifting program. \nHowever, the implementation for testing is more straightforward since \nyou won’t be competing in powerlifting meets (see the end of Level 3 \nfor peak week adjustments to training for bodybuilders). Rather, you \ncan (but don’t have to, as you can gauge progress from training loads \nusing RPE) use the testing week to gauge your lifting progress.\nDepending on how advanced you are, and if you decide to test at all, \nI would advise testing every 8–16 weeks. This can be accomplished \nby performing 1–3 accumulation blocks followed by 1–2 intensity \nblocks with the final intensity block culminating in a testing week. The \nimplementation of the testing week is very straightforward, just run it \nimmediately after the intensification block as is shown in the example.\nAccessory Exercises\nVertical and Horizontal Pulls\nVertical and horizontal pulls simply refer to back work in the vertical \nand horizontal planes, i.e. a pulldown and a row, respectively. Choose \nwhichever movements you enjoy, that you can feel the target muscles \nworking during, and that you have access to.\nFor the horizontal row, choose an exercise that doesn’t fatigue your \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n249\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nlumbar (this is more critical to the powerlifting routines where the \nperformance of the deadlift should not be compromised). I would \nadvise a cable, single arm dumbbell, chest supported dumbbell, seal/\nbench or machine row.\nFor vertical pulls feel free to select what you would like; however, if \nyou do choose to do chin ups or pull ups, make sure you can perform \nit at the appropriate RPE and rep range. If you are very strong at these, \nyou might need to do weighted chins or pull-ups, and if you aren’t \nstrong enough to fall in the appropriate RPE and rep range, choose a \nlat pulldown or machine pulldown instead. If you don’t have access to \neither, a band-assisted pull up can work as well.\nWhen you see low reps and heavy loads assigned for vertical and \nhorizontal pulls, I would opt for a solid free weight or bodyweight \nversion. For example, an elevated Pendlay row or bench row (AKA seal \nrow), or chins (with weight as needed).\nVertical and Horizontal Pushes\nVertical and horizontal pushes simply refer to pressing work in the \nvertical and horizontal planes. For example, an overhead press and a \nchest press, respectively.\nPreferably choose barbell based movements when using a %1RM based \nprogression as these allow smaller increases in load, micro-loading, and \nmore accurate estimations of 1RM from AMRAPs. If you have an injury-\nrelated issue that prevents the use of a barbell for pressing, dumbbells \nor machines can be used, and the dumbbell load can be added together \nto estimate 1RM (just be aware of the limitations I mentioned), or simply \nuse RPE.\nFor horizontal pressing, you can use a decline or incline press, just don’t \nuse a very severe angle in either direction. In the novice bodybuilding \nprogram on Day 4, you’ll see I specify an incline push specifically. This \ncan be dumbbell, barbell, or machine as desired.\nFor vertical pressing, feel free to do either standing or seated presses.\nSquat Variants\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n250\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nWhen given the choice of performing a squat variant, any variation of \na barbell free weight squat can be performed. This could be high-bar, \nlow-bar, front, Zercher,  safety-bar squats or squats with a pause or \naccommodating resistance.\nSelect the variant that is pain-free, a low injury risk, one that you \nenjoy, that you are confident that you can master, and that suits your \nbiomechanics. For example, if you find that you are very bent over when \nyou perform a low-bar squat to full depth, you may wish to choose \none of the other variations that allow a more upright body position \nto ensure more even lower-body development. You may decide to \nperform the same variation of squats on all days or to perform different \nvariations. Just be aware, that if you always use different variations it \nmay increase the time to master both movements. \nIf you are a powerlifter and you are aware of any specific technical faults \nwell suited to a specific squat variant (see the weak point discussion in \nLevel 4) this is a good place to use that variant. \nIf an injury prevents you from performing a barbell based squat of any \ntype, a leg press variant can be used in the place of a squat variant.\nLeg Press Variants\nLeg press variants include any form of hack squat or leg press machine \nor even Smith machine squat if the legs are placed out in front of you \nwhile you lean back into the bar to maintain an upright torso. Essentially, \nthe goal is to perform a squat-like movement without having to support \nthe load with your upper body as much as you do when performing a \nsquat variant.\nLeg press variants are placed in the bodybuilding programs strategically \nto reduce lower-back and hip fatigue and stress while still allowing a \nsquat-like movement to be performed to train the legs.\nChoose whichever variation you prefer that you can perform for a full \nrange of motion pain-free. These can be replaced with squat variants, just \nbe aware of the potential for increased lumbar and hip fatigue and stress.\nHip Hinge Variants\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n251\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nLike the leg press variants, hip hinge variants are used to strategically \ntrain the posterior chain without having to support the load with your \nupper body as much as you do when you perform a deadlift variant. \nThese exercises are slotted in to reduce lumbar and hip fatigue.\nHip hinge variants include movements such as glute ham raises, \nweighted back extensions, reverse hyperextensions, barbell hip thrusts \nor glute bridges (you can use the Smith machine). Cable or machine \nhinges (like a pull through) can also be used. If you do decide to test \nthese movements just be aware of the limitation that AMRAP 1RM \nestimations will be less accurate when using them. A deadlift variant \ncan be used in place of a hinge variant, just be aware of the potential \nrisk of increased lumbar and hip fatigue and soreness.\nDeadlift Variants\nDeadlift variants in the bodybuilding programs refer to conventional, \nsumo, Romanian deadlifts, good mornings, or deadlifts with a modified \nrange of motion or with accommodating resistance.\nWhen selecting a deadlift variant, choose one with a low risk of injury, \nand make sure you perform it with proper, safe form, and don’t neglect \nthe eccentric portion of the lift (it can be fast, but not completely \nuncontrolled how a powerlifter might perform it).\nIf you select a sumo stance deadlift, do not perform it ultra-wide if you \nonly compete in bodybuilding, rather use a stance just slightly wider \nthan your hand position. This can be a great position for a bodybuilder \nto perform a deadlift as it allows a straighter back, more upright torso, \nthereby reducing injury risk, while also mimicking the biomechanics of \na conventional deadlift.\nWhen you see a deadlift variant with higher reps programmed (6+), \nI recommend using a Romanian deadlift or a good morning. The \nadvantage of selecting a Romanian deadlift or a good morning is \nthat the eccentric will be automatically controlled; however, these \nmovements take more kinesthetic awareness and time to master and \nperform properly with heavy loads.\nIf you are a powerlifter and you aware of any specific technical faults \nwell suited to a specific deadlift variant (see the weak point discussion \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n252\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nin Level 4) this is a good place to use that variant.\nIf an injury prevents you from performing a barbell deadlift variant of \nany type, a hip hinge variant can be used in its place.\nBench Press Variants\nIn the powerlifting programs, bench variants refer to alterations to your \ncompetition bench, such as a closer or wider grip, board presses, flat \nback or feet up, longer pauses (e.g. 2 count bench), or bench press \nwith accommodating resistance. Close-grip bench press should not be \nperformed with an extremely close grip, rather just closer relative to \nyour competition bench press grip width. The closest the grip width \nshould be is a width similar to that of a push up performed with the \nelbows tucked at your sides.\nIf you are a powerlifter and you aware of any specific technical faults \nwell suited to a specific bench variant (see the weak point discussion \nin Level 4) this is a good place to use that variant.\nDips\nDips are performed on parallel bars or a dip station with added weight \nif needed to reach the target intensity and repetition combination. If \ninjury precludes you from doing dips in this fashion, you can do them \non a chair with your feet up and the external load placed on your torso \nor in your lap, but this removes the pecs from the equation. Rather, if \nan injury prevents you from doing dips as advised, swap dips out with \na decline press of your choosing, barbell or dumbbell preferably.\nSingle-leg Squat Variants\nSingle-leg squat variants are primarily in place to ensure equal \ndevelopment across legs, and to ensure adequate coordination and \neven contribution of force when performing bipedal exercises such as \nsquats or leg press to reduce the risk of injury.\nPreferably, select a free weight (or bodyweight or assisted with bands \nversion if you are not strong enough to add external load yet) movement \nsuch as Bulgarian split squats, lunges, step ups, or single-leg squats \nwith a kettlebell or dumbbell on the floor if you have the mobility or \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n253\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nwith one leg off a plyo box.\nYou can select a machine based movement such as a single-leg leg \npress, but this will only help you ensure equal force production between \nlegs, and not necessarily coordination and balance. Thus, the injury \nprevention effect will be reduced; however, heavier loaded single-leg \nsquats sometimes are better suited to machine based options.\nIsolation Exercises\nBicep curls, triceps extensions, leg extensions, leg curls, and other \nsingle-joint movements should be performed with a full range of motion \nand in a safe manner that is pain-free. Whether you use free weights, \nmachines, cables or some other variation you would like to employ is \nentirely your choice, just ensure that you are able to perform it pain-\nfree and with a full range of motion.\nFlys can be performed with cables or dumbbells or machines and can \nbe performed at incline or decline angles if preferred.\nStanding calf raises don’t necessarily need to be standing, they just \nneed to be straight legged (for example a calf raise on a leg press).\nWhen you see the same exercise listed on multiple days with a number \nafter it, like “Leg Curl 1” or “Leg Curl 2”; this means to choose two \ndifferent variations on the same movement. This could be a seated leg \ncurl on one day, and a lying on the other (or a standing leg curl if you \nhave access), or if you only have one type of leg curl, it can be a single \nleg on one day, bilateral on the other day.\nGrip Work\nIn the advanced powerlifting program, you will see grip work listed for \n3 sets. You have a number of options. You can do timed holds with a \nbarbell pulled just out of the rack near deadlift lockout; I advise doing \nholds for 10–20 seconds with 90–110% of your max, building up over \ntime. Another option is to do a single arm bodyweight hang for time, \nagain 3 sets of 10–20 seconds. The latter is a good choice when your \nspine is fatigued from compression. Lastly, you can do other types \nof grip work of your choice, but just remember as a powerlifter, the \nspecific grip strength you need is holding statically onto a very heavy \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n254\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nbarbell (squeezing something closed won’t transfer as well).\nWhy There Are No Shrugs or Direct Abdominal Work in the \nBodybuilding Programs\nTo be perfectly honest with you, I’ve never actually seen a bodybuilder \nimprove their abs or their upper traps by adding in these exercises to an \nalready well-balanced routine that includes deadlift and squat variants, \noverhead pressing, rowing, other compound free weight exercises.\nI’ve seen bodybuilders who don’t have a program that includes a lot \nof compounds seemingly benefit from performing shrugs and direct \nab work, but I’ve never seen these exercises reliably improve trap or \nabdominal development when a program already has free weight rows, \nsquats, deadlifts, and presses.\nI’ve also met many bodybuilders who claim that these exercises are \ncritical to the development of their traps and abs, but invariably these \nbodybuilders are already performing forty-odd exercises, so how would \nthey know what was doing what?\nMost convincingly, I’ve seen bodybuilders remove shrugs and direct \nabdominal work from well-balanced plans that include a lot of compound \nexercises without any detriment to their traps or abs.\nNow, all that said, when I work with bodybuilders who specifically have \nweak traps or abs, I do prescribe direct ab work and shrugs. That’s just \ncommon sense and even if it’s not successful, it’s worth the attempt. \nSo, if you do happen to be someone with weak abdominal muscles \n(and not just someone who holds fat in their midsection) or upper-trap \ndevelopment, feel free to add a few sets of these exercises per week.\nSubstitutions\nSwapping out accessory movements is also an option in any of these plans. \nTo do so, just make sure that you have a rationale for your choices, and \nalso make sure the substitutions are of similar movement patterns and train \nsimilar muscle groups. This is important in order to maintain the integrity of \nthe programs as they are designed to take overlap into account.\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n255\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nDual Athletes\nIt is very common these days to compete in both strength and physique \nsport throughout a lifting career, season to season, or sometimes even \nin the same season. I personally compete in both powerlifting and \nbodybuilding and have for years. That said, to successfully compete \nin both sports requires careful planning and appropriate periodization.\nMost commonly, bodybuilders will compete in powerlifting in the \noffseason as a way to keep their competitive drive, encourage \nprogression, and to have the bounds of an appropriate weight class to \nprevent excessive fat gain. Less commonly, powerlifters might compete \nin a bodybuilding show as a part of a weight cut that takes them to \na lower weight class, and results in getting as lean as a competitive \nbodybuilder. Finally, some athletes equally enjoy both sports and train \nfor both without having a primary focus.\n“Powerbuilders” have to be careful to ensure that participation in \none sport doesn’t negatively affect their goals in the other. Also, I \nhighly advise novices to not compete in either sport. Once you are an \nintermediate you can consider competition.\nFor the Bodybuilder Who Competes in Powerlifting\nIf your primary goal is bodybuilding, but you enjoy competing in \npowerlifting in the offseason, or perhaps in a lighter weight class when \nyou are dieted down for your shows in-season, I would advise running \nthe bodybuilding programs in this book as written. All that needs to be \ndone is to select the powerlifting style competition back squat, deadlift \nand bench press in all instances where you can choose a squat, deadlift, \nor horizontal push variant, respectively.\nAdditionally, for intermediates, a cycle of the Intermediate Bodybuilding \nProgram can be performed with slightly lower rep ranges and higher \nloads (as is indicated in the intermediate bodybuilding overview above) \nin the final mesocycle immediately prior to the meet.\nAdvanced bodybuilders should perform an intensification cycle \nimmediately prior to the meet like they would prior to AMRAP testing.\nIn the case of either an intermediate or advanced bodybuilder competing \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n256\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nin a powerlifting meet, the final mesocycle should be followed by a \ncompetition taper modeled off the tapers for the intermediate and \nadvanced powerlifting programs, per your experience level.\nFor the Powerlifter Who Competes in Bodybuilding\nIf your primary goal is powerlifting, but you occasionally compete in \nbodybuilding after the process of dieting for a weight class, I would \nadvise running the powerlifting programs as written. However, you \nsimply need to add 2–3 sets of 8–15 reps per week each, for triceps, \nbiceps, and calf isolation to round out your physique. Additionally, \nit wouldn’t be a bad idea to add 2–3 sets of 8–15 reps per week of \nhamstring curls as the short head of the bicep femoris only crosses the \nknee and thus may be underdeveloped if only hip extension movements \nlike squats and deadlifts have been performed [12]. Finally, the rectus \nfemoris is targeted more in a leg extension while squats train the other \nthree heads more effectively (vastus lateralis, medialis and intermedius) \n[13]; so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to include leg extensions as well in a \nsimilar manner to curls.\nTry to progress these movements in a linear fashion using an RPE of \n6 to 8 for as long as possible. Eventually, when you stall, switch to \nthe intermediate linear wave loading progression and smaller load \nincreases to extend your progression.\nWhen it comes time to peak for your bodybuilding competition, follow \nthe training adjustment recommendations for bodybuilding peaking at \nthe end of Level 3 and have them coincide with a deload. But, I would \nnot advise doing high-repetition competition deadlifts or squats as \nyou will not be adapted to the high levels of fatigue. Rather, perform \nisolation movements or a leg press variant.\nFor the True “Powerbuilder”\nFor those who place equal importance on both sports, essentially you \nwill use a combination of the above two methods depending on what \ncompetitions you have on the horizon. When you are in an offseason from \nbodybuilding and competing in powerlifting, use the recommendations \nfor a powerlifter who competes in bodybuilding. At the point that you \nare three to six months out from starting bodybuilding contest prep, \nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n257\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nstart using the recommendations for a bodybuilder who competes in \npowerlifting, and continue this throughout your bodybuilding season.\nIf you have a powerlifting meet in the midst of what is primarily your \nbodybuilding season, perform a competition taper and modify training \nas recommended for the bodybuilder who competes in powerlifting. \nIf you have a bodybuilding show in the midst of what is primarily a \npowerlifting season, coincide a deload week of training with the training \nadjustment recommendations for bodybuilding peaking at the end of \nLevel 3 (again, following the advice on exercise selection I mentioned \nin the last subsection).\nSAMPLE PROGRAMS\n258\nTHE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: TRAINING\nReferences\n1.

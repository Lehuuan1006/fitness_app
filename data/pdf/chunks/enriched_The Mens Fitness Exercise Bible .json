    "content": "01 THE MEN’S FITNESS FOOD PYRAMID Remember the USDA Food Pyramid? The one that was posted by the lunch line in your grade school cafeteria and taught in health class? The government’s official position on how you should eat to be fit and healthy included recommendations to consume up to 11 servings of pasta, bread, and crackers per day; limit meat and eggs to three servings; and count potatoes as a vegetable. Yeah, don’t eat like that. The Food Pyramid was so misleading and inaccurate that in 2011 it was replaced with the USDA’s MyPlate, an improved but still flawed approach to fighting obesity. To be fair, the government’s nutrition advice is aimed at the average American who desires to be in only average shape (read: not obese). As we assume you picked up this book to be bigger, stronger, more ripped, and healthier than that, you need an entirely different approach. To that end, we’ve created the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid—an easy visual guide to eating for physique enhancement, performance, and optimal health. See how the pyramid works below and then use it to build a better body. HIT YOUR NUMBERS As a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms of macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat gets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of protein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by multiplying the numbers in the Men’s Fitness Food Pyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these numbers and you’ll hit your goals. With that said, your nutrition doesn’t need to be as precise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You’ll do just fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat (which we’ll show you how to do) and keeping a general tally. MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY The calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are just a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the proper amounts for his own body. If you’re not losing weight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try experimenting with bumping up your protein and fat intake a bit",

PROTEIN With protein being the main component of muscle tissue, your intake of it must remain high no matter your goal. To make size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per pound of your body weight to support optimal growth. When dieting, you must create a caloric deficit—but that can cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do it. That’s why we increase protein intake and decrease starchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein to as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but start lower and increase gradually as you reduce your calories slowly. If you feel like you’re not recovering from training or you’re losing muscle, up the protein fast. The best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder. A three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the size and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains 20–25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and zero carbs. CARBS All carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your blood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels. Research, including a study at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise— particularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles",

    "content": "So if you’ve just worked out, more of the carbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes for protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a mixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss this more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get stored around your waist. For this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs come before, during, and shortly after training. It also means that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to get lean—you need to keep insulin levels low. “If someone is in fat-loss mode,” says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a nutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, “I like to limit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when they’ll go where you want them”—that is, to muscle tissue. For muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes included) to meals around training time first, before adding them to other meals. Carb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their whole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily (excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green vegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat one gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight when dieting and two grams per pound when you want to put on muscle. A fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about one cup and gives you 40–45 grams of carbs and negligible protein and fat. FAT “We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for hormone production,” says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a nutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco, CA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind, helps in the creation of testosterone, which does everything from getting you big and lean to keeping your “little friend” ready to say hello",

    "content": "Contrary to popular opinion, when dieting, you don’t need to drop your fat intake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when carbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as well as a good source of energy. Most of your fats should come by way of your protein foods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of oil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well. Aim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to start. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat, and one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat. Two tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your thumb and contains 15–20 grams of fat. WORKOUT NUTRITION Research hasn’t yet clarified the optimal amount of protein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the maximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than none, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male subjects one of the following to consume after weight training: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of amino acids (components of protein), a combination of both, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos shake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the other groups, which the researchers presumed was because the concoction did the most to reduce muscle protein breakdown after training. Meadows recommends taking in 25–50 grams of protein, 25–35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before training. Afterward, consume another 20–40 grams of protein and 40–80 grams of carbs—you can begin chugging this shake during the workout as well to limit muscle breakdown even further, though this may not be necessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make shakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein source, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for carbs. If powders and shakes aren’t in your budget, Miyaki says you can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout. One or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt muscle breakdown",

A PERFECT DAY How to plan your eating to achieve your goals Let’s say you’re a 180 POUND MAN who wants to lose his gut. You could start your diet eating about 2,100 CALORIES DAILY (180 × 12) consisting of 180g PROTEIN, 180g CARBS, and 70g FAT. HERE’S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS GUY’S BUSY SCHEDULE.

When you’re eager to work out, the last thing you want to do is slow your roll with a long warmup that has you flopping around the floor like a fish, draining your momentum. If you passed fifth grade P.E., you’ve already had it drilled into you that warming up is crucial and not to be skipped, so we’ll spare you the speech about howimportant it is. Instead of lecturing, we’ll give you some warmup options that get you sweating and ready to perform any of the workouts that follow, but also fit into the time you have and your level of patience—whatever the case may be. Most important is that you don’t start lifting heavy weights, jumping, or running totally cold, which common sense should tell you is an injury waiting to happen. A) B) OPTION 1 THE BEST WARMUP If you have at least an hour in which to train, or a history of injuries that could otherwise impede your ability to train safely, your warmup should begin with foam rolling and include a wide array of dynamic exercises and static stretches",

    "content": "If you’ve tried a foam roller after a tough workout, you were instantly aware of its ability to help relieve muscle aches and soreness. It also provides an easy way to start getting warmed up, as it promotes blood flow. Rest your muscles on the roller (a tennis ball, softball, or lacrosse ball work, too) and roll them out for about 30 seconds each. When you find a tender spot, hold the position until you feel it begin to release (or for as long as you can stand it). Pay extra attention to the hips, glutes, outer and inner thighs, lower back, calves, and lats. You can repeat the rolling after your workout as well if you like, as this may enhance recovery. Perform some light activity that elevates your heart rate and makes you feel warm (though not necessarily fuzzy). This could be a set of 30 jumping jacks, a five- minute walk on the treadmill (set to a slight incline), or a C) minute or two of jumping rope. Other cardio machines like a stationary bike or an elliptical machine can also get your blood flowing. Now you’ll begin what’s often called a dynamic warmup. In addition to encouraging further blood flow and higher body temperature, dynamic exercises take your muscles through the ranges of motion you’ll use in your workout, preparing you to get into those positions safely. There are endless options, but try this routine. 1 SHOULDER OVER AND BACK PERFORM 15 REPS Hold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar in front of your hips with hands outside shoulder width. Keeping your elbows straight, raise your arms overhead and behind your body as far as you can. Bring them back in front of you again. Continue going over and back and gradually narrow your grip as you feel your shoulders loosen up. 2 HIP HINGE PERFORM 15 REPS Place your hands on your hips and stand with feet hip width.

Keep the object you’re holding above and slightly behind your head the whole time—don’t let it drift in front of you. 4 SIDE LUNGE PERFORM 10 REPS ON EACH LEG Stand with feet hip width and step out to your left.

D) At this point, it’s wise to statically stretch muscles that you know to be chronically tight. For most people, the hips, glutes, and lats are bound up due to many hours sitting at desks in front of computers, but stretch whatever areas you feel need it most.

Place your hands on your hips and push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Squeeze your glutes on your right side. For a more intense stretch, reach your right arm overhead and lean back slightly while keeping your hips forward. Another progression is to reach back and grasp the outside of your rear foot and gently pull it off the floor. You’ll feel the stretch go into the top of your thigh. LAT STRETCH Grasp a sturdy upright object with your left hand, thumb facing up, and bend your hips back until your torso and arm are in line and you feel a stretch in your lat. Move gently from side to side so you stretch the entire muscle.

OPTION 2 THE MEATHEAD’S WARMUP Most guys come into the gym and grasp the bar or a pair of dumbbells and do a light set of 15–20 reps. Then they go a little heavier and cut the reps down a bit. They’ll do one more set and, now that they’re sweating, figure they’re ready to go. While this is hardly the best way to prep your body, it does serve the purpose most of the time, assuming you’re not training too heavy. But take it a little slower and more deliberately, and you’ve got a more decent warmup routine for when you’re doing one of our lifting workouts and need to get done in a hurry. Here’s how to warm up for a heavy strength workout that begins with a barbell exercise. More accurately, this is called “working up” in powerlifting circles, because the goal is to gradually work your way up to using the heaviest weights possible. You start with the empty bar and perform 10–15 reps with perfect form and then add weight in moderate increments until you’re at the maximum load you plan to lift on the exercise. Here’s how it might look for a guy working up to a 275-pound squat for five reps: There’s no exact formula for how to do this, so the weights and reps above aren’t mandatory, but the idea is to start very light, pump some blood into the working muscles and lubricate the joints, and then add weight steadily until you comfortably arrive at the heaviest load you can use for the target reps. The reps on these work-up sets are kept low (after the first set or two) because you need to conserve energy for the main effort, the work set. These sets also serve to reinforce good technique, so the form on the exercise is fresh in your mind and the body is in its groove to do it properly when you get to a challenging load. How long should you rest between sets? Since work-up sets aren’t as taxing as your main work sets, you shouldn’t need to rest long",

    "content": "A minute or so will be fine for most until you get up to heavy weights, at which time you can rest longer. There are a few tricks you can employ to make this process even more effective and make your top set even heavier, or at least feel easier. Try doing your last work-up set a little heavier than the main set, but only for one or two reps, so it’s not too strenuous. Then back down to the weight you intend to use for the work set. For instance, if you’re going to perform a squat with 275 for five, your last four sets could look like this: In other words, you gradually work up to an even heavier weight, reducing your reps to minimize fatigue, and then go back down to 275. The set with 300 might be way more than you can handle for five reps, but done for only one, it will feel relatively easy. By comparison, 275 will feel much easier when it’s done afterward. Obviously, this won’t work on super-heavy sets when your target reps are in the 1–3 range, but it’s great when they’re between 4 and 8. Another trick, which we learned from Jason Ferruggia, a strength coach in Los Angeles, CA, is to back the weight down for a set before you reach your target. This works well if you’re trying to hit a new max (one rep), which can be very intimidating. The weight tends to feel very heavy at around 90 percent of your max, and it can dissuade you from going any heavier. By going a bit lighter for a set and then working your way back up, you give your nervous system more time to adapt. The weight feels lighter, so you feel more confident, and the rest of the way up to your max weight goes smoother. Say you’re trying to bench press 315 for the first time. Your last few sets could develop like this: To be clear, working up is not optional. Because it can be time consuming, if you have time for only one kind of warmup, this should be it. But we strongly suggest that, whenever possible, you employ one of the other options we list here beforehand",

    "content": "Incidentally, working up applies to training with kettlebells/dumbbells, a suspension trainer, and bands as well. Start with light resistance, gradually tapering your reps as you up the intensity. OPTION 3 THE PRACTICAL WARMUP As the name implies, this routine is for when you have time to warm up, but not enough to do everything listed in Option 1. In this case, you need to get a good sweat going and prepare your muscles and joints to move while doing the bare essentials. According to Ben Bruno, a celebrity trainer at Rise Movement in West Hollywood, CA, you should hit a cardio machine for five minutes followed by these stretches. “Do toe-touch squats and sumo squat holds (both of which are explained below) to improve mobility,” Bruno says. TOE-TOUCH SQUAT Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Reach down to touch your toes with legs extended and then bend your hips back to squat down, keeping your lower back in its natural arch. Now reach your hands overhead and come up. SUMO SQUAT HOLD Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Bend your hips back and squat down, keeping your lower back flat and reaching your hands to your toes in the bottom position. Hold the position for a few seconds and then use your elbows to push your knees farther apart so you can sink deeper into the squat. DID WE SAY THIS WOULD BE BRIEF? In a nutshell, that’s all you need to know about warming up. Note that even if you’re doing a lower-body workout, it’s smart to include some upper-body warmup moves because the entire body is connected. Tightness or coldness in the upper torso can lead to injury when working the legs, and vice versa; so while you may abbreviate or recombine the warmup moves listed here, don’t ignore whole muscle areas just because you’re not training them that day. For the cardio routines beginning in chapter 26, you don’t need to do any more warming up than what is already built into the workouts. 03 FULL GYM We all love to bitch about our gyms",

If you’re lucky enough to have a membership to a training facility, this chapter is for you. Or, if you’ve put together a well-stocked home gym, this is where you should start as well. While it may not be the fitness paradise you crave, it almost certainly has all the tools you need to build a great body. The workouts that follow will show you how to take advantage of them.

With that much inventory, you can easily complete the various options of workouts we outline for you. These include three distinct routines for gaining muscle, two for losing fat, and two for body recomposition —workouts that hit the magical combination of both muscle gain and fat loss to reshape your physique with minimal change in body weight. THE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #1 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S. We can’t ov erstate the awesomeness of German engineering. The land that brought us jet planes, the Mercedes, and Heidi Klum also introduced perhaps the best method of body recomposition known to the fitness industry —that is, a timeless strategy to gain muscle and lose body fat simultaneously . A chtung! HOW IT WORKS Hala Rambie, a scientist who defected to West Germany during the C old War, found that fat loss could be accelerated by raising lev els of blood lactate—an energy substrate. More lactate corresponds to greater release of growth hormone, which tells y our body to grow muscle and burn flab. The best way to raise lactate quickly is to pair upper- and lower-body exercises, or opposing movements, for reps in the 8–15 range. The sweet spot for sets is three, and rest periods are restricted to 30–60 seconds",

The remaining exercises are done as straight sets. To increase the intensity, decrease your rest between sets by 15 seconds every two weeks. Start by resting 60 seconds for the first two weeks. Then in Weeks 3 and 4, rest 45 seconds, and so on. TEMPO Each exercise is assigned a tempo. (A “0” indicates no time—simply mov e on to the next digit.) For example, a front squat with a tempo of 3110 would be done like so: Take three seconds to lower y ourself into the squat. Pause for one second at the bottom.

THE BEST BODY- RECOMPOSITION WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #2 BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S. Use this routine just as y ou did the prev ious one—Body - Recomposition O ption A . It’s another example of German Body C omp training and can be done in conjunction with O ption A . If y ou choose to do the two workouts for a few weeks, alternate them for three sessions per week, resting a day between workouts (and then two day s afterward before repeating). 1A FRONT SQUAT SETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.

THE BEST FULL-BODY MUSCLE WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #3 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S. Full-body workouts sound like they would take a long time. But when y ou boil down the exercises y ou need to perform in order to cov er ev ery area, there are only three y ou need to be concerned with—a push, a pull, and a squat. This is the ultimate in minimalism and works superbly for beginners or people who are short on time. HOW IT WORKS A ny kind of pressing exercise will train y our chest, shoulders, and triceps. A ny pulling mov ement (a row or chinup v ariation) recruits y our back, rear delts, biceps, and forearms. Squatting mov ements (and deadlifts, which aren’t quite a squat but require all the same muscles) take care of the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Ev en y our calv es get some stimulation as they help to stabilize y our squat. Your abs, of course, get worked on all these mov ement patterns, prov ided they ’re done with free weights rather than machines, and work to brace y our spine throughout. The workout at right contains everything you need to put on size fast—a squat, press, and pullup—done with heavy weights, and you should be able to wrap it up within 45 minutes. DIRECTIONS C omplete all fiv e sets for the squat and then perform the ov erhead press and weighted pullup in alternating fashion. That is, complete a set of the press, rest, then do a set of the pullup, rest again, and repeat until y ou’v e finished all fiv e sets for each. 1 SQUAT SETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 120 SEC. Set up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the rack",

Extend your hips to come back up, continuing to push your knees outward. 2A OVERHEAD PRESS SETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC. Set the bar up in a squat rack or cage and grasp it just outside shoulder width. Take the bar off the rack and hold it at shoulder level with your forearms perpendicular to the floor. Squeeze the bar and brace your abs. Press the bar overhead, pushing your head forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes your face. 2B WEIGHTED PULLUP SETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 90 SEC. Attach a weighted belt to your waist, hold a dumbbell between your feet, or if you can’t complete your reps with weight, use body weight alone. Hang from a pullup bar with hands just outside shoulder width. Pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar. THE BEST FULL-BODY MUSCLE WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #4 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.

This routine is ideal if y ou find y ourself with a bit more time to train than y ou did when choosing O ption A . It can also be alternated with O ption A , to add some v ariety to y our training. The different exercise and rep ranges will switch up the muscle-building stimulus. DIRECTIONS A lternate sets of the bench press and seated cable row. So y ou’ll do one set of 1A , rest, then one set of 1B, rest again, and repeat until all sets are complete.

Most big-box gy ms feature a cluster of machines arranged in such a way as to prov ide members with a “circuit.” C ircuits are a gy m’s equiv alent of a no-brainer, requiring only that the trainee mov e from machine to machine for a prescribed number of repetitions, ov er and ov er again. We’ve got a better circuit—one that involves free weights, to build more muscle, burn more calories, and keep you challenged for the long term. HOW IT WORKS This routine prioritizes abs by placing them first. From there, y ou’ll mov e on to a light circuit that will burn loads of calories. Finally , y ou’ll hit the main circuit, which builds strength and muscle. DIRECTIONS Perform the first exercise as straight sets. Exercises 2A through 2D are done as a complex, so choose one pair of dumbbells and use them for each mov e. Use a load that allows y ou to complete y our reps on y our weakest exercise in the series. Perform six reps for each of the exercises. Rest 90 seconds and repeat. For exercises 3A through 3D, adjust your equipment and loads as necessary, but perform them in the same circuit fashion. If you choose to repeat the workout, vary the sets and reps you perform on these last four exercises each session. This will help you to continue milking gains from the circuit for months on end. Rotate between 3 sets of 10 reps, 4 sets of 5 reps, and 2 sets of 15 reps. 1 SWISS BALL PLANK CIRCLE SETS: 2 REPS: 30–45 SECONDS (EACH DIRECTION) REST: 60–90 SEC. Place a Swiss ball on the floor and get into pushup position with your hands on it. Now lower your forearms to rest on the ball, keeping your entire body in a straight line with abs braced. Use your elbows to roll the ball in a circular motion, clockwise and then counterclockwise, as if you were stirring a pot. 2A DUMBBELL ROMANIAN DEADLIFT SETS: 3–5 REPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.

In later chapters we’ll show you how to get great workouts for any body part with a barbell alone, but here we’ve got routines that work your whole body. You don’t necessarily need a bench, a rack, or even two matched plates to get a good workout with a barbell. A corner of a room in which you can wedge one end can be enough. And if you use the Olympic lifts—the exercises contested in Olympic weightlifting competitions—you can hit every major muscle of the body in minutes. These are just two of the approaches you’re about to discover. THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #8 BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T. If y ou train at home or any where else that prov ides only a barbell and a small amount of weight, y ou can make the most of it by speeding or slowing y our reps and performing y our exercises circuit-sty le. HOW IT WORKS The barbell was inv ented to carry balanced loads but works just as well out of balance. The following exercises can be performed with one end wedged between two walls while y ou lift the other end like a lev er. You may find that pressing the bar like a lev er feels less stressful to y our shoulders, plus it activ ates y our core to a greater degree. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without rest. If an exercise feels easy using the load y ou hav e av ailable, perform y our reps slower and with more control. (O r, if y ou hav e extra weight, load it.) A nother option is to choke down on the bar. Gripping it lower will decrease y our mechanical adv antage and make the exercise harder",

The pace will be so intense that you’ll be grateful the workout is over in six minutes. Fortunately, your metabolism will remain accelerated for 48 hours afterward.

A fter the last exercise, check y our timer and rest as long as it took y ou to perform the circuit. Repeat for three total circuits. Choose a load you could use for 10 reps on a normal overhead press, and keep that same weight for all the exercises. 1 ROMANIAN DEADLIFT REPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC. Hold the bar at shoulder width and stand with feet hip width. Bend your hips back as far as you can. Allow your knees to bend as needed while you lower the bar along your shins until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Keep your lower back arched throughout. Squeeze your glutes as you come back up. 2 HANG CLEAN REPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC. With the bar in front of your thighs, bend your hips and knees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees. Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the ceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact. 3 FRONT SQUAT REPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC",

While this argument is pretty much a stalemate, we’ll take kettlebells. For one, kettlebells have thicker handles, so your grip and forearms are recruited more heavily. For another, the bell hangs at a distance from the handle, so the load is offset, which makes every move more difficult to stabilize and more demanding of your core to provide that stability. Furthermore, just about any exercise you can think to do with a dumbbell can be replicated with a kettlebell and will feel much harder. But, hey, people have been getting ripped sans kettlebells for years, so if dumbbells are all you have, forget what you read above. Dumbbells tend to take up less space and are a little more convenient to store, and they’re certainly more common and easy to find, so you might as well learn how to make the most of them. This chapter explores your options when training conditions are most dire—when you have access only to embarrassingly light weights, mismatched weights, or even just one weight. All the workouts that follow can be performed with either dumbbells or kettlebells. Or, a single bell, as the case may be.

Whether y ou’re v isiting relativ es or in a hotel with an underwhelming “fitness center,” there may come a time when all y ou hav e access to is a measly pair of dumbbells or kettlebells. Not a problem, now that y ou hav e this routine. HOW IT WORKS In this situation, the load y ou hav e will be more appropriate for some exercises than others. To see that y ou get the most out of the workout we prescribe here, whatev er the poundage y ou hav e to work with, y ou’ll need to adjust the speed of y our reps. A pair of 25-pound dumbbells, for example, probably won’t be challenging on exercises such as the stepup. In this case, perform y our reps more slowly to test y our endurance and build muscle control. O n other exercises, like the bentov er lateral raise, 25 pounds may be just right or a bit heav y , so perform y our reps explosiv ely . If you should happen to have two unevenly weighted dumbbells, such as a 25-pounder and a 15-pounder, don’t be discouraged. Simply switch the weights in your hands each time you repeat the circuit. Asymmetrical loads force your core to stabilize you even more on each exercise. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without rest. A fter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then repeat. C ontinue for 20 minutes. You can repeat the workout up to four times per week. 1 SIDE PLANK W/ LATERAL RAISE SETS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.

If the dumbbell or kettlebell you have is too heavy to perform a lateral raise with in this position, you can use a weight plate from the dumbbell (if it’s the plate-loaded kind), or simply skip the lateral raise and use the weight to resist your side plank. 2 SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT SETS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Hold a dumbbell in one hand and stand on the opposite leg. Bend your hips back and lower your torso until you feel your lower back is about to lose its arch.

THE BEST TWO- DUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL WORKOUT [option B] WORKOUT #11 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S. A hotel or home gy m outfitted with just a small dumbbell rack can easily become a torture chamber with a little creativ ity . High reps, circuits, and supersets (two exercises done back to back with no rest) can make ev en the lightest weights feel heav y after a while and make the workout double as a cardio session. HOW IT WORKS The biggest obstacle y ou’re likely to face with nothing but dumbbells at y our disposal is a lack of weight to make y our legs work hard. This workout’s fast pace will help to offset that, and so will working one leg at a time. Be prepared to switch to lighter dumbbells on subsequent circuits when the fatigue really kicks in. If y ou hav e only one pair of dumbbells, ignore the rep ranges on ev ery thing but the Bulgarian split squat and stepup, and go for as many reps as possible each set. DIRECTIONS Perform exercises 1A through 1C as a circuit. So, y ou’ll do one set of the Bulgarian split squat, one set of stepups, and then one set of the dumbbell squat before resting for two minutes. Repeat until all the prescribed sets are complete. Perform the remaining paired exercises (2A and 2B, 3A and 3B) as supersets. That means y ou’ll do a set of A and then a set of B before resting, and repeat until all sets are completed for the pair. The last exercise, the pushup, is done as conv entional straight sets. 1A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT SETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Stand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and rest the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. 1B STEPUP SETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.

Incidentally, if you train at home and have just one dumbbell that you’ve been using as a paperweight up until now, this workout applies equally to you (kettlebells and dumbbells can be used interchangeably). HOW IT WORKS O ne bell offers a distinct set of benefits from a pair. Your body will hav e to compensate for the imbalance by recruiting y our core muscles more intensely , and working one side at a time will make for longer sets with a greater cardiov ascular demand. Done as a circuit, the exercises that follow raise y our heart rate ev en further, making this workout a great adjunct to a strict diet for fat loss. DIRECTIONS The workout consists of two circuits. In C ircuit 1, y ou’ll perform the exercises in sequence for six reps each. C omplete as many rounds as possible in six minutes, and then rest one minute. Repeat twice more and then rest two minutes before beginning C ircuit 2. CIRCUIT 1 1 ONE-ARM SNATCH REPS: 6 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Hold a kettlebell in front of your thighs with your right hand and stand with feet between hip and shoulder width. Keep your torso as upright as possible and bend your knees until the weight hangs at mid-shin level— maintain the arch in your lower back. Jump, extending your hips explosively, and raise the weight straight up your body. When it gets to your chest, flip your wrist and “catch” the bell overhead with arm extended. 2 KETTLEBELL PRESS-OUT REPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.

From there, take a deep breath and bend your hips back, allowing the weight to swing back between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and exhale—allowing the momentum to swing the weight up to shoulder level. Control the descent, but use the momentum to begin the next rep. CIRCUIT 2 TURKISH GETUP Lie on your back on the floor holding a kettlebell with your right hand over your chest, arm perpendicular to the floor. Bend your right knee 90 degrees and plant your foot on the floor. Brace your abs and raise your torso off the floor. Use your left hand for support. Now use your right foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left leg back and rest on your left knee. Come up to a standing position, and then reverse the motion to return to the floor. Note that the foot that rests on the floor changes with the hand that’s holding the weight (when you perform the getup with the left hand, your left foot will lie flat). Perform one rep with the weight in your right hand and then immediately switch hands and repeat. Switch back to your right hand and do two reps. Then do two on your left. Continue adding one extra rep in this fashion until you’re up to five on each side. Without rest, reverse the process and work back down to one rep. 06 MACHINES We’ve never been big fans of machines at Men’s Fitness. For most people, they represent taking the path of least resistance—literally. Machines determine your range of motion and the way your muscles move the weight, so you don’t train your body to do these things. If you’re just getting into lifting and want to gain weight and get stronger, machines aren’t the best way to go. But if you’re older and have nagging injuries, or you want to isolate one muscle at a time to bring it up, machines may be your best weapons",

In any event, you can get just as hard a workout with machinery as you can with iron. A note here: Whenever possible, we’d prefer you do your machine exercises on Hammer Strength equipment (lifefitness.com). This is a quality brand that offers a unique feature—isolateral movement. That means you can lift each limb independently. In this way, Hammer Strength equipment follows your unique biomechanics, letting your limbs work in their natural fashion, rather than having to conform to the narrower paths that most machines set. THE BEST ALL-MACHINE WORKOUT WORKOUT #13 BY JASON FERRUGGIA There are three likely reasons y ou would do a workout entirely with machines. O ne is that y ou fear free weights. A nother is that y ou’re in a hotel gy m with machines as y our only workout options, and the third is that y ou’re a little beat up and need to protect ov erworked joints or work around nagging injuries. Whatev er the case may be, machines are suitable muscle- building equipment, and y ou can train y our whole body with them. HOW IT WORKS This workout uses a classic body building approach: py ramid sets. You start with higher reps and increase the weight slightly each set while reducing reps to gradually warm up the muscles and joints and recruit more and more muscle fibers. No matter how hard y ou train or how heav y y ou go, y ou’re unlikely to get injured, because the machines are stabilizing the load for y ou. This isn’t alway s ideal, but it does allow y ou to push y ourself and focus y our mind solely on the muscles y ou want to work without worry ing about a freak accident keeping y ou out of the gy m for weeks. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. The remaining exercises are done as conv entional straight sets",

Adjust the height of the seat so that the handles are in line with the middle of your chest. When you grasp the handles, your elbows should be bent nearly 90 degrees. Press the handles until your elbows are locked out. Keep tension on your muscles at the bottom of each rep. 1B CHEST-SUPPORTED ROW SETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC. Using a chest-supported row machine, row the weight to your belly, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. 2A SHOULDER PRESS SETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC. Adjust the seat of a shoulder press machine so that the handles are at shoulder level. If you have shoulder problems, and if your machine allows it, grasp the handles so your palms face each other. Otherwise, grasp them with palms facing forward as normal. Make sure your elbows track in a normal pressing path as you press the handles overhead. 2B NEUTRAL-GRIP PULLDOWN SETS: 3 REPS: 15, 12, 10 REST: 60 SEC. Attach a close-grip V-handle to the pulley of a lat- pulldown machine, or use two single-grip handles as shown. Grasp the handle so your palms face each other and set your legs under the pad.

But this isn’t a fair judgment, especially if you’re using high-quality bands. We like the loop bands that Elitefts.net sells. They’re durable and can be used for multiple purposes andnumerous exercises. If a cheap one is all you have, you can make do, but Elite’s bands are a good investment, especiallyif you plan on traveling a lot. Lightweight and compact, they allow you to take your workouts with you. What bands provide that no other equipment (except cables) can is accommodating resistance. Take the pushup, for example. The closer you get to locking out your elbows, the easier the exercise feels. The movement feels hardest when your chest is close to the floor. Adding resistance to the pushup with a band will intensify the last few inches of the move—as the band gets more stretched out—making you work harder, and there’s nothing wussy about that. THE BEST FULL-BODY BAND WORKOUT WORKOUT #14 BY BEN BRUNO This workout gets y our blood mov ing. In fact, it makes it run up and down y our body as y ou alternate between upper- and lower-body exercises, forcing y our heart to work extra hard, which in turn, stimulates calorie burning. The result is increased strength and conditioning while trimming fat. HOW IT WORKS The exercises are grouped into “non-competing” mini-circuits. This means that they work different areas of the body so muscle fatigue isn’t carried ov er from one mov e to the next. For instance, following up a pushup with a good morning won’t make y our chest any more tired, so y ou can giv e each exercise y our full effort and strength. Your heart, howev er, experiences the opposite effect. With blood racing back and forth to different muscles, y our heart rate is constantly elev ated",

Note that the last group is just two exercises, though done in the same fashion. Make sure y ou hav e a few different band options so y ou can use the appropriate tension on each exercise. 1A PUSHUP SETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp the end of a band in one hand and wrap it around your back. Get into pushup position with your hands shoulder width and your core braced. Pin both hands to the floor with the ends of the band in your palms and perform pushups. 1B GOOD MORNING SETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.

Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, bend your hips back and lower your torso until it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Think about keeping your chest up and pointing forward. Explosively extend your hips to come back up. 1C PULL APART SETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC. Stand on and grasp a band loop, or a single tube as shown, hands shoulder width. Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms in front of your body to shoulder level. Now, without letting your arms drop, draw your arms out 90 degrees to your sides as if you were pulling the tube apart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together. 2A SQUAT SETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC. Stand on the band or tube with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly out. Grasp the ends of the band in each hand and hold them at shoulder level with palms facing you. Bend your hips back and squat down as low as you can without losing the arch in your lower back. Explosively extend your hips to come back up. 2B BAND ROW SETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC",

Attach the band to a sturdy object at stomach level. Hold the other end with both hands and step away from the attachment point, turning your body perpendicular to it to put tension on the band. Pull the band in front of your chest and then press it out with arms straight. Bend your arms and draw your hands back toward you, resisting the band from twisting your torso.

Tuck your elbows to your sides and extend your elbows to lock them out. 3B BICEPS CURL SETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC. Anchor the band under your feet, holding an end in each hand. Curl it without letting your upper arms drift forward. 08 SUSPENSION TRAINER The suspension trainer boom began about a decade ago, and what was once a piece of novel equipment is now hanging in gyms everywhere. The most popular brand, of course, is the TRX (trx.com), but competitors like the Jungle Gym XT (lifelineusa.com)—which we use to show the exercises that follow—are fine, too, so long as they offer foot cradles for performing lower-body exercises. With a suspension trainer’s incredible versatility, the number of exercises you can perform with it is about aslimitless as your imagination. It allows you to train the whole body using exercises that would be nearly impossible with free weights, machines, or any other equipment. And unlike those other tools, the suspension trainer can travel anywhere you do, and takes up about as much space in your suitcase as a pair of pants.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER WORKOUT WORKOUT #15 BY JAY CARDIELLO A suspension trainer, such as the TRX or Jungle Gy m XT, can mean the difference between sticking with y our training while on the road and returning from y our trav els feeling slobbish. So long as y our suspension trainer is fully adjustable and offers foot cradles y ou’ll hav e a total-body gy m that y ou can unpack from y our suitcase whenev er, wherev er. HOW IT WORKS The kind of instability a suspension trainer prov ides is ideal for core strengthening. To increase the instability , we’v e designed this workout using unilateral exercises, meaning that y ou’ll be training each side of y our body indiv idually . If y ou need to reduce the intensity of an exercise, simply increase the angle of y our body to the floor (shorten the length of the handles/straps). The workout at right lets you customize your training, giving you a specific period of time in which to do your reps, rather than a concrete number of reps to hit every set. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in sequence. Do as many reps as y ou can in 30 seconds, resting only as long as it takes to set up the next exercise. Perform two to four circuits. 1 SINGLE-LEG ROW REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Attach a suspension trainer to a doorframe or other sturdy object and stand on your left leg. Hold the handles and get into a lunge position with your rear knee bent— but keep your foot raised above the floor. Row your body to the handles while driving your right knee up in front of you. 2 SINGLE-LEG WOBBLE LUNGE REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Set the foot cradle of the suspension trainer to about a foot and a half above the floor and turn around. Raise your right foot and rest it inside the cradle. Bend your left knee so you descend into a lunge position. 3 UNI-BRIDGE PRESS REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC",

Pick up a water bottle (or some other source of light resistance) in your right hand as if you were going to press. Lean back so your body is in a straight line at an angle, suspended by the handle. Row your body up until the handle touches your ribs while pressing the right hand over your chest. 4 TAP OUT REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Set your feet in the cradles of the trainer and get into pushup position. Keeping your body straight, reach up with your right hand and tap the inside of your left elbow. Put your hand back down and repeat with the left hand. Continue for 30 seconds. 5 PUSHUP ROCKET REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. REST: 0 SEC. Get into pushup position with your feet in the cradles of the trainer and perform explosive pushups so that your hands leave the floor and you can clap in midair. 09 MEDICINE BALL The first medicine balls, used by athletes in ancient Persia, were bladders filled with sand. While medicine ball construction has come a long way since then, the science of how to use one hasn’t really had to evolve. Med balls can be thrown, caught, rested on, or lifted like other weights, to apply a variety of stimuli to the muscles. Whether you want to experiment with one as a fun way to change up your workouts, or you find yourself someplace where the med ball (or a similar-sized volleyball or soccer ball) is the only implement you have to work with, we can show you how to use it like the sophisticated tool that it is. THE BEST MEDICINE- BALL WORKOUT WORKOUT #16 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH The medicine ball has been around forev er, but most guy s don’t know what to do with it, besides holding it against their chests during situps.

HOW IT WORKS The med ball can be used to replicate v arious O ly mpic weightlifting exercises, and it makes performing them much simpler. These burn calories and build speed, which is helpful if y ou’re interested in being competitiv e in backy ard pickup games. In fact, the med ball is probably the most useful tool for dev eloping explosiv e strength because it’s meant to be thrown as hard as possible. When y ou toss it, y ou teach y our body to accelerate without braking itself for safety . Imagine a bench press done explosively—your shoulders must slow it down at the end of the range of motion or they risk getting torn out of their sockets by the speed. The ball allows your body to “let go” safely because, well, you actually let go. A med ball can also be used to create an unstable surface, such as by doing pushups on it. The dome shape forces you to stabilize your body more or risk taking a spill, and that means more activation of the abs. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll complete one set of A and then B before resting. Repeat until all sets are complete and then go on to the next superset. 1A CLEAN AND PRESS SETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC. Hold the ball and stand with feet shoulder width. Bend your hips and knees and lower your body with arms extended until the ball is just above knee level. Explosively extend your hips and knees as if jumping, shrug your shoulders, and raise the ball to shoulder level. Squat down as you “catch” the momentum of the ball. Stand up and press it overhead. That’s one rep. 1B SITUP AND THROW SETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC. Hold the ball with both hands in front of your chest and sit on the floor. Anchor your feet under something sturdy for support, and lie back on the floor a few feet away from a brick or concrete wall. Explosively sit up and throw the ball into the wall and then catch it on the rebound",

Hold the ball with both hands and get into pushup position on the floor. Drive one knee up to your chest and then quickly drive it back while you raise the opposite knee. 2B CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP SETS: 2 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.

Extend and elevate your legs out in front of you and extend your torso so that your body forms a straight line. Hold on to the bench for support. Crunch your torso forward and bring your knees to your chest. 10 SWISS BALL Swiss balls were created as a tool for rehab, but their value in working the core and a host of stabilizer muscles is now universally known. If you’re a man of average height (about 5′9″), a ball with a 65-centimeter diameter will work best for you. Always make sure the ball is fully inflated and, for heaven’s sake, don’t try to stand on it. Wacky parlor tricks have given the Swiss ball a bad name, but used properly, it can improve your balance and strength rather than deprive you of them.

But the ball can let y ou get into positions to work y our muscles that y ou wouldn’t normally think of, and the stability those positions require works more muscle than y ou realize. HOW IT WORKS Many of the exercises flow into each other or consist of combinations of mov ements that flow together to equal one rep. C ontrolling these mov ements on an unstable ball makes ev ery mov e a core exercise, ev en while y ou’re targeting the chest, shoulders, legs, and back. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without rest. A fter the last exercise, rest two to three minutes and then repeat the entire circuit for three total sets. 1 PUSHUP W/ FEET ON BALL SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC. Get into pushup position on the floor with hands shoulder width and rest your feet on the ball. Brace your abs and lower your body until your chest is just above the floor. Push back up. Do not let your hips dip or sway side to side at any point. 2 T ON BALL SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC. Lie chest-down on the ball and raise your arms out in front of you with palms facing up. Now move them out 90 degrees to form a T shape. Hold for one or two seconds with your shoulder blades squeezed together. 3 BODY-WEIGHT SQUAT SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC. Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out slightly. Sit back with your hips and lower your body as far as you can without rounding your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend and keep your chest up. 4 LEG CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC. Lie on your back on the floor and rest your heels on a Swiss ball. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the ball to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees and roll the ball toward you. Keep your hips elevated the entire set. 5 PIKE-UP TO SUPERMAN SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 120–180 SEC. Get into pushup position with your toes on the ball.

Pull with your lats to return to the pushup position and begin the next rep. 11 BODY WEIGHT The most obvious advantage of body-weight workouts is that you can do them without equipment and in almost any location. But if that means absolutely no equipment— as in, not even a pullup bar—you’ll need to get pretty creative to be able to work your back. We got that creative. When it’s warm, you may want to take your workouts outdoors and make use of equipment at your local playground, but you may not know how best to make a workout with it. We know how to make a workout with it. If you thought body-weight training was just pushups and situps, these routines will open your eyes to the multitude of ways you can get ripped at those times when you feel as if you have no options at all. THE BEST BODY-WEIGHT WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #18 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH If y ou’v e ev er wondered how guy s who work out exclusiv ely on monkey bars in the park get so ripped, this workout is the answer. We hope y ou’ll take it outside on a summer day , but it can work just as well in a bare-bones garage gy m. Not only will y ou burn fat and build muscle with just three exercises—y ou’ll learn one of the secrets street gy mnasts use to bang out dozens of reps of pullups and dips at a clip: the 10 to 1 method. HOW IT WORKS The circuit we’v e designed here doesn’t let up. When y ou train any squat v ariation, plus the pullup and the dip, y ou work nearly ev ery muscle in y our body , and y our heart will race to supply them with blood and oxy gen",

In addition to getting y ou leaner, feel free to use this workout to win bar bets about how many pullups y ou can do. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing a set of each in turn and resting as little as possible between sets. Repeat for 10 circuits (until y ou’re doing only one rep per exercise). 1 JUMP SQUAT REPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and squat down about halfway. Jump as high as you can. Land with soft knees and begin the next rep. Perform 10 reps. Each time you repeat the circuit, perform one less rep. So the next round you’ll do 9 reps, then 8, and so on down to 1 rep. 2 PULLUP REPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC. Hang from a pullup bar, jungle gym, or tree limb and pull yourself up until your chin is higher than your hands. Perform 10 reps down to 1 as described at left. 3 DIP REPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.

This workout is outside the box —so much so, in fact, that y ou’ll hav e to go outdoors to do it. HOW IT WORKS This routine requires a park or play ground area with monkey bars and plenty of open space. You’ll use classic, though under-prescribed, body -weight exercises like the bear crawl and crab walk, which y ou probably hav en’t tried since y our day s in summer camp.

To target y our back, which is usually unworkable without hav ing at least a bar of some sort to pull on, we’re employ ing the “blurpee”—as made famous by fitness expert Tim Ferriss, author of The Four- Hour Body . The wider foot placement used in the blurpee requires more work from the lats to pull the hips and legs forward as the body comes back from the pushup position. (The extra “l” in blurpee stands for “lats.”) DIRECTIONS Perform the exercises as conv entional straight sets, completing all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. 1 CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP SETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 60–90 SEC. Get into pushup position and place your hands close so that your thumbs touch. Keep your body straight and your core braced. If that’s too easy, elevate your feet on a chair or some other raised surface. 2 STEPUP SETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60–90 SEC.

HOW IT WORKS You’ll make use of peak contractions (holding the top, flexed, position of a rep for a second or two), slow negativ es (lowering the weight with control), and stretching between sets.

THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #23 BY JASON FERRUGGIA A barbell’s main selling point is that it allows y ou to maximally stimulate muscle, but it isn’t written in stone (or, perhaps, iron) that y ou must use heav y weights, or any weight at all. If a barbell is all y ou hav e to train with, we’ll assume that y ou don’t hav e a lot of weight at y our disposal any way , so this workout is a minimalist’s dream. HOW IT WORKS The Poundstone curl is simply a barbell curl done with the empty bar alone— for an enormous number of reps (in this case, we prescribe 100). It’s named after professional strongman Derek Poundstone, who, despite being 350 pounds with biceps like footballs, still swears by this deceptiv ely hard exercise. The point is simply to giv e the biceps shock treatment with a protocol they ’v e nev er encountered before—v ery high reps and short rest until exhaustion. The pullover/triceps extension works your lats as well as your triceps. By getting the lats involved, you incorporate strong stabilizing muscles that will let you go a little heavier on the triceps extensions—even if all the weight you have left to add is a couple of 2.5-pound plates.

THE BEST BAND-ONLY ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #24 BY NICK TUMMINELLO Sometimes building muscle is as simple as doing reps as fast as y ou can to get a pump as quickly as possible. It may sound haphazard, but this band-only workout can add as much as an inch to y our upper arms in just six weeks! HOW IT WORKS This workout should be implemented for a period of six weeks—enough time to elicit growth, but not so much as to allow y our muscles to adapt to the stresses.

The pushdown and curl pump y our arms full of blood, driv ing nutrients into the muscles and stretching their cells. A s fun as the pump is for showing off, it’s also a sign that real growth is on the way . DIRECTIONS A lternate the band pushdown and band curl. Perform each mov e twice. If y ou like, repeat the workout once per week for up to six weeks. Perform two sets the second week as well, followed by three sets in Weeks 3 and 4. In Weeks 5 and 6, perform four sets. A ssuming y ou’re following the weight-gain eating rules outlined in C hapter 1, y ou could see up to a solid inch added to y our arms in that span. 1 BAND PUSHDOWN REPS: 60 REST: 0 SEC.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER ARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #25 BY BEN BRUNO O v er the past decade, suspension trainers hav e sky rocketed in popularity , and for good reason. The kind of whole-body training y ou can perform on a suspension sy stem is as efficient as it is effectiv e, and studies hav e shown that compound mov ements release more muscle-building hormones than do isolation mov es. While the following workout seems to target y our entire upper body , the stress it places on y our arms in particular will get them looking as good as if they were trained with isolation mov ements. HOW IT WORKS The workout starts with pushups and rows. It will hit the chest, shoulders, and back, too, of course; but it won’t shortchange y our biceps and triceps. In fact, ev en though y ou’re not working them in isolation, the bi’s and tri’s will kick in harder because they ’re lifting more of y our weight than they could if y ou were doing simple curls or extensions. Nev ertheless, there’s a place for these mov ements, too—right after the compound lifts, when y ou’re looking to finish the arms off with more direct stimulation. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1A PUSHUP SETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.

Hold the handles and lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the harder the exercise; you can elevate your feet to make it even harder.)

Pair the two mov ement patterns up and y ou’v e got a complete arm blast, and that’s what we did here. You’ll finish with eccentric chinups, which are just normal chins done with an extra-slow negativ e. This causes more muscle damage in the biceps, leading to greater growth, and that’s alway s cool— ev en if there’s no one else around to notice. DIRECTIONS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1A CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP SETS: 5 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC. Place your hands inside shoulder width and lower your body until your chest is about an inch above the floor. To increase the difficulty, elevate your feet on a bench or box. 1B CHINUP SETS: 5 REPS: 6–8 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp the chinup bar at (or slightly inside) shoulder width, with palms facing you. Pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar. 2A TRICEPS EXTENSION SETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC. Get into pushup position and rest your forearms on the floor, palms down. Keeping your core tight and your body in a straight line, extend your elbows so your arms are straight. 2B ECCENTRIC CHINUP SETS: 4 REPS: 3 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp a chinup bar at shoulder width with palms facing you and jump into the top position of a chinup. Take five seconds to lower yourself down to the hang position. That’s one rep. 13 BICEPS When you first start training, an equal amount of arm work for the biceps and triceps is enough to stimulate even gains. But down the line, one muscle always seems to develop ahead of the other and you end up needing to give the weaker one greater attention. If it’s your biceps, you’re about to learn a bevy of new curls that will peak your peaks fast and for a long time to come.

The following workout prov ides good v ariety and intensity while av oiding the common pitfall of ov ertraining. HO W IT WO RKS You won’t be doing a lot of work, but ev ery exercise was carefully chosen. Fattening the grip on dumbbell curls requires more tension from y our hands and forearms to hoist the weight, and this transfers to y our biceps. The rarely seen behind-the-back cable curl puts the biceps at an especially tough mechanical disadv antage, which forces y ou to ov ercome a lot of resistance as y ou contract them from a stretched position. The EZ-bar preacher curl finishes the workout with the strictest possible mov ement. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises at the end of an upper-body workout once per week. 1 FAT-GRIP HAMMER CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC. Select two dumbbells and wrap towels around each handle to thicken it. Another option is to use rubber-grip sleeves like Fat Gripz (available at fatgripz.com) or Grip4orce (shown below, grip4orce.com). Keeping your upper arms stationary at your sides and your palms facing, curl the weights. 2 BEHIND-THE-BACK CABLE CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC. Attach a D-handle to the low pulley of a cable machine, grasp the handle in your left hand, and step forward (away from the machine) until there is tension on the cable and your arm is drawn slightly behind your body. Stagger your feet so your right leg is in front. Curl the handle but do not allow your elbow to point forward. 3 EZ-BAR PREACHER CURL SETS: 2 REPS: 8–10 REST: 60 SEC.

Take three seconds to lower the bar back down. THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY BICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #28 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S. The biceps are small muscles that aren’t designed to handle a lot of weight, but they do respond well to high reps, short rest periods, and multiple angles. With only a barbell loaded with a modest amount of weight and some earnest effort, y ou can build a solid pair of biceps muscles without ov ertaxing y our biceps tendons. HO W IT WO RKS The workout starts with a rev erse curl—the weakest grip y ou can curl with because y our palms are facing down. It gradually progresses y ou to curls in stronger positions so that y ou can use the heav iest weights possible and keep y our intensity up ev en as fatigue sets in. A nd “fatigue” is putting it mildly . Twenty reps per set will hav e y our arms in agony , and then y ou’ll finish them with ladder sets—conv entional curls done for more reps in each successiv e set until y ou’re doing 50 with just the bar. By that point, that’s all the weight y ou’ll be able to lift. DIREC TIO NS C omplete each exercise in turn.

Keeping your upper arms against your sides, curl the bar. 2 WIDE-GRIP CURL SETS: 1 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp the bar with hands wider than shoulder width—if you’re using an Olympic bar, your pinkies should be on the outside knurling. Perform curls. 3 CLOSE-GRIP CURL SETS: 1 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC. Curl with your hands inside shoulder width, in the middle of the bar. 4 CONVENTIONAL CURL SETS: 4 REPS: 20, 30, 40, 50 REST: 60 SEC.

You might think that cheating on an exercise is only cheating y our muscles out of the best possible stimulus, but then how do y ou explain all the guy s with mountainous biceps slinging dumbbells to their shoulders on curls? While we wouldn’t recommend making bad form a staple in y our workouts, we’ll admit that sometimes it helps to break the rules, and with this dumbbell-only routine, we’ll teach y ou how to cheat to win. HO W IT WO RKS The workout starts with strict dumbbell curls. Since y ou’ll be fresh, y ou should hav e no trouble giv ing each set y our utmost focus, using only the strength in y our biceps to complete y our reps. The drag curl follows— another mov ement that relies on precise form and prev ents y our shoulders or back from assisting. Later, y ou can loosen up, doing curls again but this time with intentional cheating. A t this point, y ou’ll be tired and unable to execute reps with perfect technique any way , so y ou’ll get a little help from y our hips to power through y our sticking point. Your biceps will still be working hard, and with most of y our workout accomplished, all y ou need do now is top them off with blood to ensure the greatest growth. DIREC TIO NS C omplete all the prescribed sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. 1 CURL SETS: 4 REPS: 15, 12, 8, 8 REST: 60 SEC. Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your sides. Keep your weight on your heels and lean forward slightly. Without letting your upper arms drift forward, curl the weights, rotating your wrists outward so that your palms face you in the top position. Hold the top for a moment and squeeze your biceps",

Perform as you would the conventional dumbbell curl, but stand tall and drive your elbows back as you curl so the head of each dumbbell touches the front of your body throughout the rep. (Keep your palms facing up the whole time.) It should look as though you’re dragging the weights up along your torso. 3 HAMMER CURL SETS: 4 REPS: 15–20 REST: 60 SEC.

Choose the heaviest dumbbells you think you can curl, and perform as you did the conventional dumbbell curl, but use momentum from your hips to power through the sticking point (halfway up, when the weights are most difficult to lift). Do not lean back as you lift, but get into a rhythm where you rock your torso forward and then extend your hips to complete each rep. Stop each set one rep shy of total failure. THE BEST BAND-ONLY BICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #30 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. It was once thought that the pump was just a cosmetic side effect of lifting weights, but it’s actually an integral part of the muscle-building process. Performing reps creates tension in the muscles that, to some degree, pinches off the v eins that take blood out of them while the arteries that deliv er blood to the muscles continue unobstructed. So the muscles fill up with blood faster than they can be cleared of it. This “cell swelling” stretches the muscle cell membranes, sending the body the message that the muscles aren’t big enough to handle the blood flow to them. Bands create enormous tension throughout a muscle’s entire range of motion, and yet the tension is easily adjusted depending on how you stand or position your body",

Raise your arms out 90 degrees with elbows extended—you should still feel some tension on the band in this starting position. Curl the bands toward your ears and hold the contracted position for two seconds. 3 REVERSE CURL SETS: 4 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC. Attach a band to a sturdy object in front of you and stand facing it. Hold the band in both hands and walk backward, adding tension to the band.

Repeat the first exercise, but use a higher-tension band, or use a wider stance to increase the resistance on the band you have. Perform only 50 reps this time. 14 TRICEPS Many guys unfairly focus on their biceps, thinking that the key to bigger arms lies in doing more curls. The truth is that the triceps make up most of the upper arm (two- thirds, in fact), and while they’re not as much fun to practice posing in the mirror as their neighbors to the north, they account for more impressive pipes when fully developed",

THE BEST FULL-GYM TRICEPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #31 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.

A fterward, y ou’ll lighten up on the remaining exercises and go for a big pump, getting as many reps as y ou can per set and limiting y our rest periods.

MURPHY, M.F.S. When it comes to planning a triceps workout, most people immediately think of cables. While cables certainly lend themselv es to productiv e triceps training, they ’re far from y our only option. In fact, with only a barbell at y our disposal, y ou can blast y our triceps while secondarily hitting other upper-body muscle groups, like chest and back. HO W IT WO RKS The pullov er is generally used as a back exercise because bringing y our arms from behind y our head to ov er y our face mainly calls on the lats. But the triceps get inv olv ed too—particularly the long head, which runs down the inner side of y our arm—assisting the mov ement. If y ou think about y our triceps while y ou perform y our sets, and activ ely flex them at the end of each rep, y ou’ll feel them get tired and sore. It’s not exactly “The Force,” but it does help y ou get more out of y our exercises and the limited equipment y ou hav e. DIREC TIO NS C omplete all the prescribed sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. If y ou hav e an EZ-curl bar instead of or in addition to a straight barbell as shown, feel free to use it as a substitute. It can reliev e discomfort of the elbows and wrists. You may also perform the ly ing triceps extension and pullov er on a bench or similarly elev ated surface in order to put more of a stretch on the triceps. 1 CLOSE-GRIP FLOOR PRESS SETS: 5 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC",

HO W IT WO RKS When trainers write workouts for clients they hav en’t met (in this case, y ou), they often prescribe doing reps for a certain amount of time. So whether an exercise is easy or hard for y ou, y ou’ll be able to get something out of it (i.e., y ou’ll do more reps if it’s easy and fewer if it’s hard). The band exercises we’re giv ing y ou work that way , and body -weight training makes up the rest. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets. So y ou’ll do a set of A and then a set of B before resting. Repeat for all the prescribed sets. 1A DIP SETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC. Use dip bars if available, or place your palms on a bench or chair and extend your legs in front of you. Lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor, but no lower. Extend your elbows to come up. 1B TRICEPS EXTENSION SETS: 4 REPS/TIME: 30 SEC. REST: 90 SEC. Attach the band to a sturdy overhead object and grasp the free end (or handles) with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your sides and extend your elbows to lockout. 2A CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP SETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC. Get into pushup position with your hands inside shoulder width. Keeping your abs braced, lower your body until your chest is just above the floor and then push up. For an advanced workout, use the band for resistance by wrapping it around your back and holding an end in each hand. 2B DOUBLE-BAND TRICEPS EXTENSION SETS: 4 REPS/TIME: 30 SEC. REST: 90 SEC. Set up as you did for the triceps extensions, but attach a second band to the loop of the first one. Grab the ends of the second band and perform triceps extensions with a slight bend in your hips.

It may seem random, but y ou’ll end up getting plenty of pushups done, and when y ou don’t hav e weights to apply a more strenuous load to y our muscles, giv ing them a high v olume of work is the only way to induce enough muscle damage to result in growth.

Place the cards facedown. The numbers on the cards will be the number of reps you’ll perform—face cards count as 10, and aces may be wild but no less than 10. Flip a card in one pile and perform the number of reps it calls for. Rest 20 seconds and then flip another card. Continue until you’ve completed that stack and then rest two minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining two stacks. To perform the diamond pushup, get into pushup position with your hands close together so that your index fingers and thumbs touch and form a diamond shape. Keeping your abs braced and torso in line with your hips, lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor. 2 TRICEPS EXTENSION SETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTAL REST: 60 SEC. Use an elevated surface that’s about waist height and can support your weight, such as a windowsill.

In addition to the workouts we’ve provide here, there are some other steps you can take to bolster your forearm gains. Avoid using wrist straps on your back exercises, especially the deadlift. The harder you can squeeze your hands around a bar—and the heavier that bar is—the more forearm muscle you’ll activate. THE BEST FULL-GYM FOREARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #36 BY MARTIN ROONEY A gy m towel can be used for more than soaking up sweat and protecting y our modesty in the locker room. When used as a handle, it’s a cheap, portable, and highly effectiv e tool for beefing up y our forearms. HO W IT WO RKS The forearms are best activ ated by exercises that hav e y ou pulling and squeezing. Using a towel as an attachment for cable rows and pullups intensifies muscle recruitment. A lthough this workout targets y our forearms, y ou can’t help but strengthen y our back and biceps doing these exercises as well. A fter a few weeks, y ou’ll probably notice that conv entional barbells, dumbbells, and cable attachments feel thin as pencils. DIREC TIO NS Perform the workout one day per week, spaced at least a day between any other back or biceps training. Hold the top (contracted) position in each rep for one second. C omplete all sets for one exercise before going on to the next. 1 TOWEL CABLE ROW SETS: 3 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC. Hook a towel to a cable pulley and stand in front of it",

Loop a towel around the bar of a lat-pulldown machine and hold an end of the towel in each hand. Your arms should be extended and at eye level. Brace one foot on the seat of the machine and pull the bar to your chest as in a normal row. 3 TOWEL PULLUP SETS: 4 REPS: 5 REST: 90 SEC. Hang a towel over a pullup bar and grasp an end in each hand. Hang from the towel and then pull yourself up until your chin is above your hands. If that’s too difficult, simply hang from the towel for as long as you can. 4 TOWEL KETTLEBELL CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 6 (EACH SIDE) REST: 90 SEC. Run the towel through the handle of a kettlebell, or wrap two towels around a pair of dumbbells as shown, and fold it in half. Hold both ends in one hand (for kettlebell), or both ends in each hand (dumbbells) and curl, keeping your upper arm stationary. THE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY FOREARM WORKOUT WORKOUT #37 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S. There are a number of rules y ou hav e to follow when training muscles like the pecs, biceps, and thighs: Use a full range of motion, hold at the top, use strict form, etc. Thankfully , forearms are a bit simpler—just squeeze. HO W IT WO RKS Gripping heav y weights and holding on is pretty much all it takes to make y our forearms blow up. Just picture a construction worker, strongman competitor, or heav y deadlifter—they all sport impressiv e forearms ev en if they don’t spend much or any time training them directly . That’s the main goal with this workout. Handle as heavy weights as possible for as long as you can before letting them drop (and hopefully not on your toes). The farmer’s walk may sound easy but it’s one of the most exhausting exercises you can perform, and not just for the forearms, but every part of you",

Pick up the heaviest dumbbells you can handle and walk with your chest out, standing tall with arms at your sides. Go 40–50 yards—you can walk in a figure-eight pattern if you don’t have the space. At the end of the distance, stop and continue to hold the weights for as long as possible. 2 HAMMER CHEAT CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and cheat the weights, as if doing a clean, to the top position of a curl. Use momentum from your hips to get the weights up. Slowly lower the weights back down for five counts. 3A WRIST CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 0 SEC. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on a bench, box, or chair. Rest your forearms on your thighs and allow your wrists to bend back over your knees so the weights hang down. Curl the dumbbells up by just flexing your wrists. 3B REVERSE WRIST CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 90 SEC. Perform the opposite motion of the wrist curl. Palms face down and extend your wrists to raise the back of your hands closer to your forearms. 4 GRIP CRUSH SETS: 3 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 120 SEC. Sit on a bench, box, or chair with a dumbbell in your left. Extend your arm toward the floor and brace the back of it against the inside of your left thigh.

If y ou’re a minimalist, then y ou’v e got to lov e when y ou can do y our normal workout and get a whole new muscle-building stimulus out of it with almost no extra effort. In fact, one way to get great forearms is to do the same curling exercises y ou ty pically would but with a towel around the bar to increase the recruitment of forearm muscles. This workout makes minor tweaks to a basic arm routine to render it twice as effectiv e. HO W IT WO RKS Using a towel makes curls, which normally hit just the biceps, incorporate more of the forearm. To take it a step further, we’re prescribing rev erse curls later in the workout to target the brachioradialis (the long forearm muscle that points to y our thumb) and brachialis (a cy linder of muscle between y our biceps and triceps), but y our biceps will still get hit hard at the same time.

Loop a thick towel around the bar so that it doesn’t let your hands close all the way when you grasp it. Hold the bar with an overhand, shoulder-width grip, in front of your thighs. Without allowing your upper arms to move forward, curl the bar. Add weight each set so you must reduce your reps. 2 REVERSE CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC. Grasp the bar overhand at whatever width is comfortable. Keeping your upper arms against your sides, curl the bar. 3 REVERSE CURL 21 SETS: 2 REPS: 7 (EACH POSITION) REST: 60 SEC. Curl the bar halfway up and hold for one second. Lower it back and repeat for six more reps. Then curl the bar to the mid point and, beginning there, curl it all the way up for seven reps, using the mid point as the “bottom” of each rep.

Machines, barbells, dumbbells, suspension trainers, medicine balls, bands, and body weight all provide strategies to make your shirts tight enough to test the integrity of their buttons. THE BEST FULL-GYM CHEST WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #39 BY HANY RAMBOD Body builders of the ’70s liked to stretch and flex the muscles they were training between sets, believ ing it enhanced growth. What they stumbled upon has been refined into a formal muscle-building protocol by Hany Rambod, trainer to many of today ’s top champions including Mr. O ly mpia winners Phil Heath and Jay C utler. Here, we use his FST-7 method to pack new meat on y our pecs. HO W IT WO RKS A fter pounding the pectorals with some conv entional chest exercises, we finish them off with FST-7, which stands for “Fascial Stretch Training” done for sev en sets. Fascial refers to the fascia, the web-like connectiv e tissue that env elopes each muscle. Picture that thin lay er that cov ers a skinless chicken breast—that’s the same stuff. By stretching the fascia, y ou create more room for the muscles to grow. By flexing, y ou’ll driv e more nutrient-filled blood into the muscles to enhance gains. DIREC TIO NS Ev ery set should be taken to near failure. For the cable crossov er, alternate stretching and then flexing y our pecs between sets. So y ou’ll complete a set and then stretch for 30 seconds, then do another set and flex for 30 seconds. A fter the stretch/flex, y ou can rest up to 45 seconds. For the stretch, rest your forearms against a doorframe, or use the beams of a power rack, and lean forward. To flex, tense your pecs isometrically. 1 SMITH MACHINE INCLINE PRESS SETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60–90 SEC.

If y ou’v e gotten more scientific with y our training since and noticed fewer gains, this simple and direct approach may be what y ou need to get growing again. HO W IT WO RKS When a muscle contracts, the whole thing contracts. So when y ou hear trainers talking about exercises for the “upper” pecs and “inner” pecs, this isn’t entirely accurate. Howev er, while the whole pectoralis major muscle is inv olv ed in any kind of press, dip, or fly e motion, different parts of it are indeed emphasized depending on the angle of resistance. So while an incline dumbbell press will work the whole chest, it’s making the fibers that attach to y our clav icle work harder than the ones that attach to y our ribs. We’ve given you exercises that work every part of the chest and with varying degrees of isolation. If you don’t normally feel your pecs working on barbell presses, you’ll love what dumbbell and machine work does for you. DIREC TIO NS Stop each set a rep or two short of failure.

THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #41 BY JASON FERRUGGIA There are three training methods that hav e prov en effectiv e for building muscle: using heav y weights, doing lots of reps, and lifting explosiv ely .

HO W IT WO RKS We want y ou to perform the classic bench press on a slight incline. Not only is it safer for y our shoulders, but it also brings the pecs more strongly into the mov ement. The speed bench press is done light, but that doesn’t mean easy . Light weights trav el faster, and y our goal should be to make ev ery rep mov e at warp speed. Explosiv e reps activ ate the most powerful muscle fibers and also help y ou ov ercome sticking points in y our bench press.

THE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #42 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. C hest training is alway s done with some kind of bench.

But what if y ou don’t hav e a bench handy , which is a definite possibility in a small hotel gy m, or y our garage, where all y ou’v e inv ested in so far is some selectorized dumbbells? Here’s how to get a chest workout so effectiv e y ou won’t ev en miss the bench. HO W IT WO RKS Lacking something to stabilize y our upper body just means y ou’ll hav e to do it y ourself, which is fine—the exercises will be harder, but they ’ll activ ate more stabilizer muscles in the chest, back, shoulders, and core. Really , y our training won’t seem that different. You can still press like y ou’re benching, but y ou’ll do it on the floor. You can still do fly es, but y ou’ll do them from pushup position (y ou’ll see). The plate pressout, howev er, will likely be a brand-new challenge for y ou.

Spread your arms apart as in a normal dumbbell flye and lower your body until you feel a stretch in your chest, then squeeze the dumbbells and bring your hands back to pushup position. Keep your abs and glutes braced and your back flat throughout. If you’re using plate-loaded dumbbells, you may be able to roll the weight plates on the floor during the flye.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #43 BY BEN BRUNO When a guy wants to get a big chest, he tends to make the classic mistake of training only his chest—or training it twice as often and as hard as any other body part. Ev en if shirt-popping pecs is all y ou’re interested in, y ou’ll get faster results if y ou train the rest of the body , too, particularly the upper back and shoulders. The routine at right addresses all three. HO W IT WO RKS The more muscle y ou add to one side of y our body , the more y ou need to add to the opposite side in order to keep the balance. If y ou don’t, the body will ev entually forbid muscle growth to the area that has grown out of whack, because it doesn’t want to risk the injury . This is one of the most common and easily prev entable way s to plateau. You’ll target your chest very specifically in this routine with moves like the three-way flye, which is borrowed from gymnastics training. The pec activation is like nothing you’ve tried before, so prepare to be sore. However, to keep your upper back and shoulders growing in conjunction with your pecs, we’ve thrown in some rows, reverse flyes, external rotations, and face pulls. Think of it as a way to build your chest without breaking it. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1A 3-WAY FLYE SETS: 3 REPS: 3 REST: 90 SEC. Attach a suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object and lengthen the straps to a point at which you would to do pushups. Grasp the handles and get into pushup position with hands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your core braced. Bring your arms out to your sides as if you were giving someone a bear hug. Lower your body until you feel a stretch in your chest and then bring your arms together again. That’s one rep of the flye. Perform three reps",

All of the above equals one set. 1B INVERTED ROW SETS: 2 REPS: 12 REST: 90 SEC. Hold the handles and lean back with arms extended so that your body is supported by the trainer and only your feet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body in a straight line.

THE BEST MEDICINE- BALL CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #44 BY NICK TUMMINELLO This workout takes only 10 minutes and works the triceps hard in addition to the chest. If y ou don’t hav e a medicine ball, a firm soccer or basketball will work. HO W IT WO RKS A medicine ball is so v ersatile it doesn’t ev en hav e to mov e and it can still help y ou build muscle. You don’t hav e to throw, catch, or ev en lift it, but merely use it to balance on. Working to keep it stable will work y our own stabilizing muscles in y our core, and using it for pushup v ariations will light up y our pecs and triceps. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each back to back without rest. Do at least fiv e reps per mov e and try to add one rep each time y ou repeat the workout. C omplete one to three circuits, resting three to fiv e minutes between each. 1 LOCK-OFF SETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Get into pushup position resting your left hand on the medicine ball and right hand on the floor. Lower your body until your chest is just above the floor and then push back up. At the top, reach up with your opposite hand and slap your chest. 2 DROP N’ POP SETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 0 SEC. Place both hands on the ball and get into pushup position. Quickly let go of the ball and spread your hands out to shoulder width on the floor. When you feel your chest touch the ball, push yourself up fast so your hands come off the floor and land on the ball again. 3 CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP SETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 0 SEC. With both hands on the ball, perform pushups. Squeeze the ball hard throughout the set and keep your abs braced. 4 CROSSOVER PUSHUP SETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 3–5 MINUTES Perform a pushup with one hand on the ball, then quickly switch hands and do another rep.

HO W IT WO RKS The chest can get worked in ev ery way , ev en when heav y weights aren’t av ailable. The ply o pushup recruits some of the strongest pec fibers, and band fly es and pushups stretch and exhaust them from a v ariety of angles.

If pushups are easy for you, begin using the band for resistance and then get rid of it as fatigue sets in and finish your reps with body weight alone. THE BEST BODY-WEIGHT CHEST WORKOUT WORKOUT #46 BY BEN BRUNO The chest is probably the easiest muscle group to build up when y ou hav e no equipment. A ll y ou really need is the trusty pushup to do it. Too many guy s get bored of pushups and think they can graduate to the bench press, but if y ou can’t do 100 reps in a handful of sets, y our pecs aren’t as strong as they could be and y ou’re missing out on gains that are easily gotten through body -weight training alone. HO W IT WO RKS This workout is all about the pushup—doing it and helping y ou do it better in future training sessions. You’ll work to get 100 total reps in as few sets as possible, and then strengthen y our triceps and core directly . These muscles support y our ability to do pushups, so the stronger they are, the more pushups y ou can crank out and the bigger y our chest will get. Simple enough. DIREC TIO NS Perform the pushups as conv entional straight sets. Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1 PUSHUP SETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTAL REST: AS NEEDED Perform pushups, but go one rep shy of failure on each set and try to complete 100 reps in as few sets as possible.

Our shoulder workouts take into account weaknesses and imbalances you’re probably already suffering (whether you know it or not) to prevent you from hurting something that might take months to fix. If your shoulders already bother you, you’ll find that some of our exercises allow you to keep building them up without aggravating any injury, and may even correct the problem along the way. THE BEST FULL-GYM SHOULDER WORKOUT WORKOUT #47 BY LEE BOYCE, C.P.T. With access to all that a gy m has to offer, y ou can work y our shoulders from a v ariety of angles and, while y ou’re at it, rep schemes. Lower reps (six and under) with heav y weights result in the best strength gains. Medium reps (8–12) with moderate loads exhaust the muscles, sparking gains in sheer size. High reps (15 or more) train endurance, but in so doing hit a different set of muscle fibers that aren’t tapped by the other rep ranges. The shoulder routine here takes adv antage of all three ranges to leav e no stone unturned in y our journey for bigger delts. HO W IT WO RKS The exercises are organized into trisets—three mov es done back to back. The first lift in each triset is done heav y , the second is medium, and the third is light but for high reps. C ombine the v ariety of the exercises, the rep ranges, and the fast pace and there’s little more y ou can do to shock y our delts into new growth.

Take the bar off the rack and hold it at shoulder level with your forearms perpendicular to the floor. Squeeze the bar and brace your abs. Press the bar overhead, pushing your head forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes your face. 1B STANDING DUMBBELL FLYE SETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC. Hold a dumbbell in each hand by your sides. Without shrugging, use your upper body to swing the weights up a few inches. Your arms and torso will form an upside down V shape.

This workout incorporates weightlifting mov ements to build y our delts, but don’t be disappointed if other muscles happen to get bigger and stronger, too. HO W IT WO RKS The clean and press is frequently called the most functional exercise of all, because it works ev ery last muscle in y our body to perform a basic mov ement pattern—picking something up and raising it ov erhead. The high pull isn’t done with heav y weights, but the speed y ou perform it at recruits all the biggest and strongest muscle fibers. Note that we’re also hav ing y ou perform it with an extra-wide snatch grip.

HO W IT WO RKS We’v e taken conv entional free-weight shoulder exercises like the ov erhead press, lateral raise, and shrug and applied bands to them. You’ll hav e to fight the resistance on each mov ement as it increases, which heightens the demand on y our muscles and also teaches y ou to lift fast.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER SHOULDER WORKOUT WORKOUT #50 BY JASON FERRUGGIA The following suspension trainer workout helps target the rear delts, a muscle group that is generally underutilized and, as a consequence, underdev eloped. The imbalance results from sitting at desks with poor posture for hours on end and is compounded by most gy mgoers’ preference for bench presses ov er rear-delt exercises. This workout forces your rear delts to work harder than they ever have, and you’ll need only your body weight to do it. HO W IT WO RKS The Y raise and rear-delt fly e may be familiar to y ou, as they ’re often performed with dumbbells. But a suspension trainer makes them more effectiv e because y ou’re lifting y our body weight as opposed to tiny (and possibly pink) hand weights. O bv iously , this activ ates more muscle, and makes y ou look more like a gy mnast than an old lady in her first personal training session.

Grasp a doorknob or other sturdy object at approximately the same level and bend your hips back, keeping your lower back flat, until your arm is in line with your torso. Rock your hips side to side so you feel a stretch in your lat muscle. 3 LATERAL PLANK WALK SETS: 4 REPS: 10 SHUFFLES (EACH WAY) REST: 60 SEC. Get into pushup position and simultaneously move your left hand over your right while your right leg steps out wide. Now bring the right hand out and walk your left foot in to a normal pushup footing. That’s one shuffle. Continue “walking” for 10 shuffles and then walk in the opposite direction to get back to the starting position. Keep your core braced and your hips level at all times. THE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY SHOULDER WORKOUT WORKOUT #52 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. Your av erage trainer can think of only two way s to work y our shoulders with dumbbells—presses and raises. We’v e got a third to add to the mix, and this three-pronged attack can build shoulders as round and dense as cannonballs. HO W IT WO RKS The first exercise, a neutral-grip ov erhead press, is the safest way to do any pressing mov ement. If y ou’v e backed off of shoulder work in the past because it hurt to execute, relief can be as simple as turning y our palms to face each other. In this position, y our upper-arm bones can glide through the shoulder joints without risk of impingement",

This is an exercise popular among strongman competitors, whose shoulders are the size of pumpkins. Finally, the workout ends with seated dumbbell cleans. If you’ve ever done power cleans, you know what exploding a weight up from the floor to shoulder level can do for your shoulders, and this variation isolates them more. It’s as simple to do as it sounds: heave the weights up. Brute force builds big shoulders. DIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. 1 NEUTRAL-GRIP OVERHEAD PRESS SETS: 5 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.

Keeping your lower back flat, lean forward. Explosively straighten your body and shrug the weights so your arms rise. Allow the momentum to flip your wrists so you catch the weights at shoulder level. 18 BACK Getting your mind into back training isn’t as easy as it is with the chest and arms. Because you can’t see your back, it is tougher to visualize how it is working, and so you must learn to focus on the feeling of your muscles contracting with each rep",

If dumbbells don’t work for you, bands might, because their accommodating resistance makes reps feel different than with free weights. It’s possible that simple pullups do the trick, because you’re able to imagine your hands as hooks designed to allow your lats to move your body up and down. Whatever may work best for you, we’ve got it covered here, so you can build your back with the same intensity you do your arms. THE BEST FULL-GYM BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #53 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S. Deadlifts are one of our fav orite exercises at Men’s Fitness. They raise testosterone, jack up y our metabolism, and add slabs of muscle all ov er y our body —and to y our back in particular. Deadlifts are the centerpiece of this routine, and just when they ’v e worn y ou out, the work really begins. HO W IT WO RKS The deadlift is a strenuous exercise and usually requires plenty of rest between sets. No such luck here. You’ll keep y our rest periods short and squeak out as many reps as y ou can to exhaust y our back completely . Then y ou’ll go on to chinups—the ultimate lat builder—ly ing lateral raises, rows, and back extensions. To tell y ou the truth, the deadlift alone will leav e y our back sore the next morning. The rest of the exercises just keep it that way longer. DIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets. So y ou’ll do one set of A and then B before resting. C omplete all the prescribed sets for the pair before mov ing on. The first exercise is done as conv entional straight sets. 1 DEADLIFT SETS: 4 REPS: 5, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 15 SEC. Stand with feet hip width and bend your hips back to grasp the bar just outside your knees. Keeping your back flat, extend your hips to stand up, pulling the bar up along your legs to lockout.

When you’re done, perform one set with 70–75% of your max for five reps and then rest 15 seconds. Perform three more sets of as many reps as possible, resting 15 seconds between sets. You may get only one or two reps on these last three sets, and that’s OK. End a set if you suspect your form might be compromised. 2A CHINUP SETS: 4 REPS: 6–8 REST: 0 SEC.

Hold the bar at shoulder width in front of your thighs and bend your hips and knees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees. Now explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows and flip your wrists to catch the bar at shoulder level, palms face the ceiling. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact. 2 LANDMINE ONE-ARM ROW SETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 (EACH SIDE) REST: 90 SEC. Wedge the end of the bar into a corner (you may have to wrap it in a towel to protect the walls). Face away from the corner and hold the barbell behind the sleeve (where you load the weights) with your right hand. Stagger your legs so that your left leg is forward and, keeping your lower back flat, bend at the hips until your torso is about parallel to the floor.

If y ou’re the ty pe who likes to squat, deadlift, and ov erhead press a lot, y ou know how sore that area can get ev en when y ou feel y our other muscles are doing all the work. In this routine, we train it both directly and indirectly to fortify it for all future workouts, while training y our lats hard at the same time. HO W IT WO RKS You’ll spend most of the workout staring at the floor. That’s because y ou’ll be bent ov er holding the arch in y our lower back while giv ing y our main attention to y our lats and rear delts. This will teach these muscles to act sy nergistically and keep y our spine protected for future heav y rows, deadlifts, and so on. The stronger y our lower back, the more weight y ou can handle on most other exercises (not just for back), and greater loads mean bigger muscles.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #56 BY BEN BRUNO You know the expression that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Well, y our muscles work like a chain, too. The smaller ones are weaker than the big ones and, thus, are more likely to “break,” limiting the force the prime mov ers can produce and reducing the effectiv eness of an exercise and y our workout. If y our back has stopped growing, it’s time to start looking at the chain of muscles behind it, link by link.

THE BEST BODY-WEIGHT BACK WORKOUT WORKOUT #57 BY HARRY CLAY Dropsets are when y ou take a set to failure and then immediately “drop” to a lighter weight and continue doing reps. Used sparingly , they ’re a smart way to increase intensity and extend a set past the point where y ou’d normally be spent. Most often, dropsets are done with dumbbells or machines, but y our own body weight can be used for them too. HO W IT WO RKS The dropsets we’re using work according to mechanical adv antage. When y our arms are spread wide apart, y ou don’t hav e much lev erage to pull y ourself up, so wide-grip pullups are among the toughest of all pullup v ariations. The workout begins with those. When y ou’v e hit failure, it then goes to conv entional chinups, which are easier. When you can’t do another chinup, you’ll bring your hands even closer together, giving you the best mechanical advantage possible, and again rep out to failure. The trick is to keep the circuit going, switching to exercises that are just easy enough to let you continue doing reps. Unlike with weights, dropsets based on mechanical advantage allow you to keep the same load— your body—which ensures your lats get the greatest possible stimulus",

Because they’re enormous muscles, working the legs causes greaterrelease of natural anabolic hormones than any other body part. This contributes to the growth of all your muscles over time. And if you’re interested in playing sports, running, and preventing a hip fracture when you’re an old man, you’ll want to train legs now. The following workouts cover a broad range of approaches to leg training, with at least one guaranteed to meet your requirements. Whether it’s the ego boost from heavy squats, the challenge of suspension training, or fear of a lightbulb body (picture it) that motivates you to train your legs, we’ve got you covered.

THE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY LEG WORKOUT WORKOUT #59 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH Nowhere does the global threat of ov erpopulation seem more apparent than at the gy m after fiv e o’clock. When y ou can’t get to the squat rack or leg press machine, this workout is the answer, and it requires only a single pair of dumbbells and a step from the aerobics studio.

The dumbbell stepup targets the glutes and hamstrings; the reverse lunge works the quads; and the squat, of course, hits all three.

THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY LEG WORKOUT WORKOUT #60 BY JOHN ROMANIELLO The beauty of hav ing only a barbell to train legs with is that y ou can still do squats.

But the barbell is more v ersatile than most giv e it credit for—we can ev en show y ou how to work y our calv es with it—and when combined with some explosiv e body -weight exercises, y ou’v e got a workout that’s as good as practically any y ou’d get in a big-box gy m. HO W IT WO RKS The workout is built on circuits that alternate a heav y exercise with an explosiv e one. The heav y lift recruits a lot of muscle fibers, and the explosiv e one done immediately after allows for ev en better muscle activ ation on the next heav y set. In just a few sets and a few minutes, y ou can stimulate as many muscle fibers as y ou normally would during much longer leg workouts. In addition, the combination of strength and power y ou’ll build will help improv e sprinting speed and jump height. DIREC TIO NS The workout consists of two circuits. C omplete C ircuit 1 as directed and then repeat once more. Then mov e on to C ircuit 2 (which y ou’ll perform only once). CIRCUIT 1 Immediately after your second set of the squat, perform the jump squat. 1 SQUAT SETS: 2 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC. (AFTER THE FIRST SET ONLY) Set up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart as is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the rack.

Leg curls and split squats are commonly done with machines and dumbbells, but a suspension trainer has y ou do all the stabilizing y ourself, which means greater muscle activ ation, and greater intensity . DIREC TIO NS C omplete all the sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. 1 SINGLE-LEG GLUTE BRIDGE SETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC. Attach the suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object and lengthen one handle so it’s at about knee height. Lie on your back on the floor and place the heel of your left foot in the foot cradle. Your left knee should be bent 90 degrees and your right leg extended on the floor. Brace your abs and contract your glutes to bridge your hips up off the floor. Come up so that your right leg is in the air and in line with your left thigh. 2 LEG CURL SETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 REST: 60 SEC. Start in the same position described at left but rest both feet in the foot cradles with legs straight. Bridge your hips up so your body forms a straight line, and then bend your knees, curling your heels toward your butt. The closer you place your hands to your sides, the more support you’ll get. 3 BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT SETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC. Use the same setup as you did for the single-leg glute bridge, but stand facing away from the suspension trainer and rest your right foot in the foot cradle behind you. Make sure your left foot is lunge length in front of the trainer. Bend your hips and knee to lower your body until your rear knee nearly touches the floor. Hold on to something for support if you feel that you can’t balance yourself safely.

We can’t promise y ou’ll enjoy this routine, but we can assure y ou that it’s not like any y ou’v e done before. HO W IT WO RKS The muscles of the legs are stubborn. They carry y ou around ev ery where, so it takes more than body -weight squats to conv ince them they need to get stronger. This workout brings the pain with mov es that ask the legs to work independently or without the benefit of locking the knees out (which lets them rest momentarily during a set). C orrecting imbalances in y our legs and keeping tension on them for prolonged periods will burn like hell, but y ou’ll be amazed y ou could get such results without putting a barbell on y our back, or doing the same old exercises that didn’t work before. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1A JUMP SQUAT SETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC. Stand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out.

Lie on your back on the floor and bend your knees so your feet rest on the floor close to your butt. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the floor to raise your hips into the air. From there, walk your feet out in a V shape, taking small steps with your heels forward and away from the midline of your body. Keep your hips up.

Eventually, every guy has to work his calves, even if it’s only during the few months leading up to summer.

So if you have the patience to work them only in the late spring, that’s all you’ll need. THE BEST FULL-GYM CALF WORKOUT WORKOUT #63 BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S. Don’t ov erlook y our calv es—they ’re key to a complete phy sique. Plus, while today ’s shorts and bathing suits do a good job hiding y our thighs, y our calv es will alway s be on display during warmer months (that is, unless y ou refuse to wear shorts because of y our calv es). This routine is grounded in progressive overload, the first rule of weight training, which means gradually increasing the reps, sets, or weights you use and thereby forcing your muscles to continually adapt by growing bigger and stronger. Tack it onto the end of any leg session. HO W IT WO RKS Instead of following strict set and rep parameters, we’ll use the total-rep method. We giv e y ou a certain number of total reps to perform, no matter how many sets it takes, and then let y ou build on that total each time y ou repeat the workout. DIREC TIO NS For each mov e, choose a load that allows y ou at least 10 reps. Then perform as many sets as it takes to reach 30 total reps, resting the prescribed time between sets. The next time y ou do the workout, aim for 35 total reps, then 40, and so on until y ou reach 50. When y ou can perform 50 total reps in fiv e sets or fewer, increase the weight by 20–30 pounds and start the cy cle again at 30 reps. 1 STANDING CALF RAISE SETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 30–50 REST: 60 SEC. Use a standing calf raise machine, or stand on a block or step with a dumbbell in one hand while holding on to something for support with the other. Lower your heels toward the floor until you feel a stretch in your calves. Drive the balls of your feet into the foot plate and contract your calves, raising your heels as high as possible. Control the descent on each rep. 2 SEATED CALF RAISE SETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 30–50 REST: 60 SEC",

Perform a calf raise as described at left, but with hips and knees bent 90 degrees. THE BEST DUMBBELL- ONLY CALF WORKOUT WORKOUT #64 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S. C alf workouts hav e to be intense to be effectiv e. Think about it: A ll day long y ou’re putting stress on y our calv es, so they ’re designed for durability . If y ou want to make them grow y ou’ll need to employ ev ery trick in the book. This workout uses three of our fav orites—jumps, alternating foot placement, and mobility work. HO W IT WO RKS You’v e probably nev er considered jumping jacks a calf exercise but they demand a lot from the muscles. Follow them up immediately with calf raises and y ou’ll feel the burn fast. You’ll also notice that y our footing will change ev ery time y ou repeat a calf raise. This is to work the muscles from all angles. Turn y our toes in and y ou emphasize the fibers on the outer side of the calv es; turn them outward and y ou hit the inner part harder. Finally, you’ll work on calf mobility, which you probably never have before. This is flexibility training that’s specific to how your calves work in life. The more mobile your calves are, the more easily you’ll be able to perform calf exercises and other lifts (such as the squat and deadlift), and the more muscle you’ll be able to recruit. DIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets. So y ou’ll do one set of A and then B before resting. C omplete all the prescribed sets for the pair before mov ing on. 1A JUMPING JACK SETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC. Stand with feet close together and arms at your sides.

THE BEST BODY-WEIGHT CALF WORKOUT WORKOUT #65 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. If y ou’re serious about building muscle, y ou ev entually hav e to ask y ourself how dumb y ou’re willing to look in order to do it. Not all exercises appear cool and manly like the squat and bench press—some of them, like the ones we’re prescribing here for y our calv es—are admittedly a little strange. But they work. So, how dumb are you willing to look to build muscle? HO W IT WO RKS The calv es need stimulation any way they can get it, and y our body weight alone can be plenty , as long as y ou make it feel as heav y as possible. O ne way is to lower y our body into the bottom of a squat position, putting all y our weight squarely on y our calv es and performing calf raises from there",

Stand on a block or step with one leg, your weight resting on the ball of your foot. Wrap your free foot around the back of the working leg. Allow your body to sink toward the floor and stretch your calf. Hold for one second and then drive the ball of your foot into the surface as you raise your heel up.

Lower yourself into the bottom position of a squat (called “the hole”).

Most guy s hav e no idea that they ’re the strongest muscles in the body and the main engine behind lifting huge amounts of weight on the squat and deadlift. Your butt helps y ou run faster and jump higher, too, so when this workout brings up y our backside, remember that it’s not just for the ladies. HO W IT WO RKS The three glute exercises we’v e chosen may be the best known to man.

You won’t be able to get a full contraction on squats and other exercises that work the glutes, and that robs y ou of gains. But when y ou integrate hip-opener exercises into y our glute training, y ou can get the posterior y ou want while improv ing strength and athleticism, and warding off lower-back pain. HO W IT WO RKS The first and third exercise pairs alternate strength mov ements with mobility drills that open y our hips. Don’t skip these! They don’t exactly build muscle but rather help y ou to build muscle indirectly by improv ing y our ability to extend y our hips. That simple motion—using the muscles in y our butt to push y our hips forward—is the most powerful single mov ement the body can perform (and the foundation for sprinting and squatting). A lso, mobile hips take pressure off the lumbar spine, reliev ing any aches y ou may be dealing with back there. DIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets. 1A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT SETS: 4 REPS: 5 (EACH LEG) REST: 60 SEC.

Bend your hips back and let your knees bend as needed until you can grasp the bar at shoulder width. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor with your chest up. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, push your hips forward to raise the bar to lockout. To begin each subsequent rep, push your hips back and lower the bar to mid-shin level.

THE BEST SUSPENSION- TRAINER BUTT WORKOUT WORKOUT #68 BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T. Some exercises don’t look like much, but they allow other exercises to work better. The glute bridge isn’t as “sexy ” as a squat, but the more proficient y ou get at it, the stronger y our squat can be; and stronger squatting leads to a rounder, harder butt that women notice. HO W IT WO RKS Performing a single-leg glute bridge before a single-leg squat gets the glutes activ ated—y our mind can make a stronger connection to them during training and y our body is more prepared to fully recruit them when y ou go on to squat. Next, the glute bridges and figureheads done for high reps exhaust the muscles completely . DIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets.

O ne of the reasons a better-looking, athletic butt stands out is because of a clear div ision between the glutes and the hamstrings. The back of the leg comes up and then prominently curv es outward to form the buttock. Strangely enough, y ou can actually target this specific area, and women will appreciate it if y ou do. HO W IT WO RKS We’v e added a little hamstring workout into the glute training to strengthen both muscle groups, because they work in conjunction to extend y our hips, but this will also sharpen the distinction between the two where they meet on the back of the leg. Specifically , y ou’ll fatigue y our hams with hip thrusts on the ball and then finish them off with hamstring curls—y our glutes will be firing as well to stabilize y ou. The butterfly hip thrust provides another challenge. This one targets the gluteus medius, which is commonly underdeveloped and can lead to instability and weakness in the entire lower body",

THE BEST BODY-WEIGHT BUTT WORKOUT WORKOUT #70 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. It’s no coincidence that the best exercises for building a bigger, more defined posterior are similar to mov ements y ou make hav ing sex. Some of them are ev en nicknamed “thrusts.” The fact is, if y ou can push y our hips forward powerfully , y ou can build a stronger backside, so this workout is (almost) as, shall we say , “sport specific” as it gets.

If this sounds like an inescapable fate, thank goodness you got to this chapter. The ab workouts here may surprise or even shock you, as they’re unconventional prescriptions for getting a six-pack to pop, which is exactly why they work so well. Combine them with the dietary plan described in chapter 1 and it won’t be long before you can check “Get ripped abs” off your bucket list. THE BEST FULL-GYM AB WORKOUT WORKOUT #71 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH Training y our abs like a body builder can lead to a good-looking six- pack. But training y our abs like an athlete makes for a six-pack that can also perform.

HO W IT WO RKS C ombination mov es, where y ou pair up different exercises to form one uber-lift, train the core to stabilize y ou during complex mov ements. This workout also pay s attention to the core’s many functions— flexing the spine, controlling its extension, twisting the torso side to side, and absorbing and redirecting force. The beauty of this kind of training: You can dev elop great abs without really thinking about it. Focus on challenging, fun, mov es that remind y ou of y our day s as a high school/college athlete, and y ou’ll recov er the six-pack y ou hav en’t seen since then.

There’s a lay er of fat ov er y our six-pack that needs to be burned off before y ou can get any credit for the muscle beneath. The answer is a workout that burns fat and trains the core, and the routine at right cov ers both bases. HO W IT WO RKS It’s true that front squats are a leg exercise and ov erhead presses primarily work the shoulders, but both are also major ab builders. Your core has to work hard to keep y ou from collapsing forward on the front squat and from bending backward on the ov erhead press.

Lie on your back, knees bent 90 degrees, and raise your arms straight overhead, keeping them pointing upward throughout the exercise. Sit up halfway and then return to the floor. 3 FLUTTER KICK SETS: 2 REPS: 20 (EACH LEG) REST: 0 SEC. Lie on your back with legs straight and extend your arms by your sides. Lift your heels about six inches and rapidly kick your feet up and down in a quick, scissor-like motion. 4 STAR PLANK SETS: 2 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC REST: 60 SEC. Get into pushup position. Move your arms and feet apart as wide as possible—your body will make a star shape. Hold the position with your torso straight and abs braced for 30 seconds. 23 TRAPS If you’re a skinny guy, you probably fantasize about having big traps as much as you do big arms and pecs. Having a thick neck and traps that reach to your ears (collectively called “the yoke”) is the hallmark of defensive linemen, wrestlers, bouncers, and other badasses who clearly don’t work out just to look pretty. A guy who’s yoked looks like he can handle business. Getting that look isn’t as hard as you might think, but you will need either a barbell or dumbbells. With them, and the following workouts, you’ll never have to worry about being called a “pencil-neck geek” ever again. THE BEST BARBELL-ONLY TRAPS WORKOUT WORKOUT #78 BY JASON FERRUGGIA You’v e got to feel bad for would-be body builders who try to isolate their traps with a dozen different exercises and still can’t get them to grow—while O ly mpic weightlifters focus on just two lifts and their traps are up to their ears. The reason is that the snatch—one of the two exercises contested in weightlifting competition—incorporates a powerful shrugging motion that requires a lot of effort from the traps. By focusing on the snatch and its v ariants, y ou’ll build traps without ev en thinking about it",

HO W IT WO RKS Bringing up a weak body part tends to inv olv e making the “mind-muscle connection” and working it with high reps until it burns and leav es y ou sore for day s. But this isn’t how weightlifting is done. Because the snatch is an explosiv e mov ement dependent on speed, y ou’ll do only a few reps per set, and y ou won’t hav e time to think about what the traps are doing. You’ll just jump and shrug, and bigger traps will come. You’ll see. DIREC TIO NS C omplete all the sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the next. 1 SNATCH-GRIP HIGH PULL SETS: 3 REPS: 6 REST: 60 SEC. Stand with feet hip width, holding the bar with hands twice shoulder width. Keep your lower back arched and bend your hips back to lower the bar to just above knee height. Jump and shrug the bar so that the momentum raises it to chest level and your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Try to push your chest out as you lift the bar and contract your upper back completely. 2 SNATCH-GRIP LOW PULL SETS: 2 REPS: 6 REST: 60 SEC. Set up as you did for the high pull, but when you jump, perform an explosive shrug and bend your elbows to pull the bar into your belly. Do not continue to lift the bar up to chest level. 3 SNATCH-GRIP SHRUG PULL SETS: 2 REPS: 6 REST: 60 SEC. This is done the same as the low-pull, but keep your elbows straight and perform an explosive shrug once the bar passes your knees. 4 RACK DEADLIFT SETS: 1 REPS: 6–8 REST: 60 SEC. Set up the bar on some mats, boxes, or the safety rods of a power rack so that it rests just below your knees. Stand with feet hip width and, keeping your lower back in its natural arch, bend your hips back and grasp the bar just outside your knees. Pulling the bar into your body tightly, extend your hips and stand up.

Instead, we split up our body into parts that we train on different days; hence the term “split routine.” Yet there exists another way—to train the entire upper body one day and the lower half another—and there are several advantages to it. Working the whole upper body one day allows you to come back a few days later and work it again",

You could hit it twice in three days, doubling the muscle-building stimulus simply by switching from body-part workouts to an upper-body split. Upper-body splits are also ideal for strength building, allowing you to focus workouts around a main lift and then working all the muscles that play a part in making that lift stronger. The upper-body workouts we’ve included here pair up well with the lower-body routines that follow them, something to consider if you’re looking for a complete program. THE BEST UPPER-BODY WORKOUT [option A] WORKOUT #80 BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S. There’s no magical set and rep prescription for building muscle. Or is there? It turns out that when you look at some of the most effective muscle- and strength-building programs, they share a common trait: The total number of reps for the main exercises usually add up to around 25. Shoot for this number and your gains will add up too. HO W IT WO RKS A moderate number of low-rep sets prov ide a blend of intensity and v olume, which has alway s been associated with size and strength gains. A lmost any combination will work: fiv e sets of fiv e, six sets of four, or eight sets of three all allow y ou to put some work in with big, challenging loads, and that’s as much math as any meathead should hav e to do in the gy m. DIREC TIO NS The first time y ou perform the workout, y ou’ll hit 25 reps for the main lifts by completing fiv e sets of fiv e, as shown. If y ou repeat the workout, perform six sets of four reps. In the next session, do eight sets of three. Do not perform this workout more than twice a week, and allow at least three day s before repeating it. On each lift that you use the 25-rep rule for, spend the first three or four sets warming up so that only the last two are done with heavy weights.

Squeeze the bar and brace your abs. Press the bar overhead, pushing your head forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes your face. 2 INCLINE BENCH PRESS SETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 60–90 SEC. Set an adjustable bench to a 30- to 45-degree angle and lie back on it. Grasp the bar just outside shoulder width, arch your back, and pull it off the rack.

Pull the bar out of the rack and lower it to your sternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your sides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet hard into the floor and press the bar back up. Perform several warmup sets, keeping your reps to five or fewer. Gradually work up to the heaviest weight that you can perform three reps with (this should take at least five sets). Refer back to chapter 2 for instructions on how to work up appropriately.

THE BEST ELLIPTICAL WORKOUT WORKOUT #86 BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T. The elliptical machine offers one of the most low-impact cardio workouts possible. This routine lasts only 25 minutes, and the only pounding y ou’ll feel will be in y our chest. HO W IT WO RKS You’ll be doing interv als, gradually increasing the duration of y our work interv al while decreasing the length of the rest interv als. This intensifies the fat-burning effect while giv ing a constant stimulus to the heart and lungs. DIREC TIO NS A lternate work interv als and rest interv als on the elliptical. The pace y ou work at will be based on a percentage of y our maximum heart rate (MHR). To estimate y our MHR, subtract y our age from 220. (So, a 30- y ear-old would hav e an approximate MHR of 190 beats per minute.) Your work interv al (WI) will be 85% of that number, and y our rest interv al (RI) will be 55%. For example, a 30-year-old man will keep his heart rate at 160 beats per minute during the work interval and then reduce his effort to around 100 beats per minute for the rest interval. Note that the rest interval does not mean complete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your index and middle fingers to your carotid artery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for six seconds. Take that number and multiply it by 10 to get your beats per minute",

THE BEST ROWING- MACHINE WORKOUT WORKOUT #87 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH Unlike running or cy cling, which work only y our lower half, rowing machines (or ergometers) inv olv e almost the entire upper body as well.

You should feel pressure on the balls of y our feet and y our heels should be raised slightly off the footplate. This is the “catch” position. Drive with your legs, dropping your heels to the footplate, to push your body back and then row the handle to your sternum. Row as fast as possible for all intervals, but take twice as long to return your body back to the catch position after each row stroke. Maintain this rhythm",

HO W IT WO RKS Because y our upper body doesn’t get as inv olv ed as it is with sprinting or rowing, and there is no impact, y ou need to pump y our legs that much harder to make up the intensity on a bike. This workout aims to prov ide the same metabolic output that 30 minutes of running would elicit. DIREC TIO NS Follow the prescriptions for the different interv als. THE BEST STAIR- CLIMBER WORKOUT WORKOUT #89 BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T. O n the plus side, the stair-climber machine is easy on y our joints. O n the downside, it’s as boring as … watching someone climb stairs. A pply interv als to y our workout and y ou’ll get it done faster and more mercifully . HO W IT WO RKS Did we say “mercifully ”? That may hav e been an exaggeration, since these interv als are tough. Working at high-intensity paces for short durations (30 seconds) and low-intensity ones for longer (60 seconds) will help giv e y ou the benefits of both anaerobic and aerobic cardio. DIREC TIO NS A lternate between high-intensity , low-intensity , and rest interv als as shown. Base y our intensity off a percentage of y our maximum heart rate (MHR). To estimate your MHR, subtract your age from 220. (So, a 30-year-old would have an approximate MHR of 190 beats per minute.) The high-intensity work sets call for a heart rate that’s 85–95% of your maximum; so, a 30-year- old will keep his heart rate between 160 and 180 beats per minute during that time",

Multiply by 10 to get beats per minute. THE BEST VERSACLIMBER WORKOUT WORKOUT #90 BY HARRY CLAY A sk a UFC fighter what he fears most and he won’t name an opponent. Getting tired in a fight—“gassing”—is more daunting than any punch, kick, or choke. That’s why fighters often turn to the V ersaC limber, that v ertical apparatus with the handles and pedals y ou see making its way into the cardio aisles in gy ms ev ery where. Simulating a steep hill run or ev en mountain climbing, the V ersaC limber is gaining a reputation for prov iding conditioning workouts that are ev en scarier than fighters with nicknames like the “A xe Murderer” and “Sky scraper.” But if y ou can face y our fear, it can get y ou into fighting shape fast. HO W IT WO RKS Rather than assign y ou a specific time to work for, we’re giv ing y ou certain elev ations to hit (in feet). C limb to that lev el as fast as y ou can and then rest.

It will raise your heart rate just as effectively as any cardio machine, while benefiting your muscles. Body-weight training works in much the same way, so if you’re out of machines, just use the floor you’re standing on. THE BEST TOTAL-BODY CARDIO WORKOUT WORKOUT #91 BY RAMONA BRAGANZA A trainer to Holly wood celebrities, Ramona Braganza had to inv ent a sy stem that would both get her clients ripped in short order and keep them engaged in their workouts. Her solution mixes cardio with body -weight circuits and core training for a three-pronged gut attack.

Follow the steps in order and keep y our water handy . DIREC TIO NS There are three bouts of cardio (C ardio 1, 2, and 3), two circuits, and one core mov e. For the circuits, complete the exercises in succession and then rest 30 seconds before repeating once more. CARDIO 1 Jog for two minutes. CIRCUIT 1 A OVERHEAD LUNGE REPS: 10 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC. Raise your arms overhead and step forward with your right leg. Lower your body until your right thigh is parallel to the floor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor. B SKYDIVER LUNGE REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC. Get on the floor in the bottom of a pushup position. Push yourself up, then lower back down to rest your belly on the floor. Now raise your arms and legs up off the floor so you look like a skydiver in free fall. Place your hands and feet back down and push yourself back up. That’s one rep.

CARDIO 2 Shadowbox for two minutes. Throw punches with both hands, keep your guard up, and practice shuffling your feet forward, back, and side to side. CIRCUIT 2 A SUMO SQUAT REPS: 15 REST: 0 SEC. Stand with feet outside shoulder width and turn your toes out 45 degrees. Raise your arms up for balance. As you squat down, push your knees out and then drive your heels into the floor as you come up. B PIKE PUSHUP REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC. Get into pushup position with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Push your body backward so your hips rise in the air and your torso points toward the floor. Keeping your legs straight, lower your body until the top of your head nearly touches the floor, and then press up. C FROG THRUST REPS: 10 REST: 30 SEC. Get into pushup position with feet wide apart. Hop your feet up to the outside of your hands so you look like you’re about to leapfrog. Then hop them back again. That’s one rep. CARDIO 3 Go to a staircase and sprint or jog up it. Walk back down.

Whether y ou’re looking to plunge into swimming because y ou want a body more like Ry an Lochte’s, or y ou’re already a swimmer in need of a new challenge in the pool, float this routine for a few weeks. HO W IT WO RKS The workout stresses good swim technique. Just practicing the basic strokes correctly will get the right muscles working in addition to helping y ou cut through the water faster and more efficiently (so y ou feel more like a fish in water than out). O v er time, y ou’ll reduce y our rest periods to demand more of y our heart and increase y our potential for fat burning. DIREC TIO NS Perform the workout three times a week. Go by stroke cy cles instead of distance—a sweep of each arm in turn is one cy cle. If y our pool is too small to complete the prescribed number of cy cles in one direction, turn around quickly and continue to swim until the cy cles are complete. A fter two weeks, reduce all rests by fiv e seconds. 1 WARMUP SETS: 4 Swim 12 stroke cycles at an easy pace. You can use the front crawl stroke or swim freestyle. Rest a moment, then continue for three more sets. 2 50-YARD SWIM SETS: 6 REST: 30 SEC. Swim at a brisk pace for 50 yards, or 25 total stroke cycles. 3 FINGERTIP DRAG STROKE SETS: 4 REST: 20 SEC. Swim 12 stroke cycles, raising your elbows high out of the water as you reach for the next stroke so only your fingertips drag beneath the surface. Swim at a relaxed pace. 4 KICK DRILL SETS: 4 REST: 30 SEC. Grab a kickboard and rest your arms on it. Swim across the pool using only your legs. Do 25 kick cycles—one flutter of the left and right leg. 5 PULL DRILL SETS: 6 REST: 20 SEC. Hold the kickboard between your legs to keep them afloat, and swim using only your arms for 12 stroke cycles. Reach each arm far forward, but don’t let your fingers come out of the water",

Whether you like to take it slow and steady or hit a top speed, either of these routines will lead you closer to a lean body with a healthier heart. THE BEST ENDURANCE- RUNNING WORKOUT WORKOUT #93 BY STEVE GISSELMAN A s y ou may hav e gathered from all the interv al and circuit workouts in this book, long, slow endurance training is not the best way to lose fat. So if y ou’re thinking of starting a running program to get lean, we promise y ou’ll do better with one of our strength-training options. Nev ertheless, some people just enjoy running (may be it’s the endorphin rush known as “runner’s high”?) and ev en aspire to compete in endurance races. If that’s why y ou want to hit the trail, this program is especially for y ou. HO W IT WO RKS We’v e set up a sev en-week routine to take y ou from a newbie runner (or someone who doesn’t put in consistent road work) to an experienced one who’s ready to take on a half marathon (13.1 miles). Most of the workouts are relativ ely short, so y ou can build y our capacity gradually and av oid the knee pain and other ov eruse injuries associated with running too much, too soon. Brief workouts and plenty of built-in recov ery time also allow y ou to liv e y our life off the track—y ou don’t hav e to rearrange ev ery thing around y our training to make progress.

He likes to point out that Pay ton, who was perpetually ripped and known for his durability , made hill sprints a cornerstone of his workouts throughout his career. Do the same, and your pick-up game buddies may be calling you “Sweetness,” or, at least, not “Slowness.” HO W IT WO RKS Sprinting is intense exercise and can beat up y our lower body if y ou don’t ease into it. That’s why we recommend doing it on a hill like Pay ton did, which will slow y ou down a bit so that y ou’re less likely to pull a hamstring, quad, or hip flexor. Still, y ou’ll work hard enough to raise testosterone and growth hormone lev els—both associated with muscle growth —as well as improv e speed and athleticism. WARMUP Warm up thoroughly beforehand and run a few practice sprints at a low intensity (but go a little faster each time). SPRINT Perform 8 to 10 sprints of 20–40 yards. Run at slightly less than your absolute top speed for safety. Rest as needed between sets, but keep your heart rate elevated. Allow yourself enough recovery that you can go fast. If you’re new to sprinting or haven’t done it in a while, do your sprints on a hill. Start with five and run only at a moderate pace and build up from there. Land on the balls of your feet as you sprint, not your heels. Your front foot should land directly beneath you (unless the hill is especially steep). Your arms should pump vigorously forward and backward as you run. Let your hands come up to face level and then back to your pockets, but no further. Keep your shoulders and hips level so there’s no side-to-side rotation in your torso. 29 BOXING & MMA Every guy wants to look like a fighter, before a fight, that is",

THE BEST PUNCHING- BAG WORKOUT WORKOUT #95 BY ZACH EVEN-ESH Boxers, kickboxers, and mixed martial arts fighters don’t use treadmills to get ripped. Their shredded phy siques come from fight training, of which pounding a heav y bag is a major component. Dust off the one in y our basement, lace up the glov es, and beat y our gut once and for all.

Pivot on your support foot and turn your hip over as you deliver the kick, to maximize power. Complete five low kicks. 2 HIGH KICK – RIGHT LEG REPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC. Kick the upper half of the bag, as if aiming for an opponent’s head. Keep your hands raised as if guarding your chin. Throw five kicks. 3 LOW KICK – LEFT LEG REPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC. Repeat the low kicks on the left leg. 4 HIGH KICK – LEFT LEG REPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC. Repeat the high kicks on the left leg. 5 PUNCHES REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.

THE BEST JUMP-ROPE WORKOUT WORKOUT #96 BY MARTIN ROONEY, C.S.C.S. Some time after grade school, guy s stop jumping rope—unless they grow up to be boxers. But the jump rope may be the most portable and conv enient cardio tool av ailable. Relearn how to use it and y ou’ll be lean, spry , and well conditioned for life. HO W IT WO RKS Make sure y ou’v e got a good rope. Beaded or plastic “speed” ropes are more durable than cotton ones and whip around faster, making for a more intense workout. They ’re also mandatory if y ou want to build up to doing adv anced jump-rope mov es like the double jump (which we’v e included here, although we don’t expect y ou to master it right away ). Before y ou begin using a rope, measure it to y our height. When y ou stand on the middle of the rope, the handles should extend to y our armpits. C ut and adjust the length as necessary . You have to gradually prepare your lower body for the impact of jumping, so begin on a waxed wooden floor or rubber floor. Hold the rope with hands at about hip height and elbows slightly bent, keeping your upper arms close to your sides. Your chest should be out and your shoulders back and down. Make your jumps small and land on the balls of your feet. DIREC TIO NS The workout consists of three training blocks. You’ll practice different jumps, rest two minutes, and mov e on to the next block. Follow the instructions. BLOCK 1 1 FORWARD JUMP REPS: 60 SEC. Jump over the rope with both feet on every revolution, swinging the rope forward (the most basic jump). 2 SIDE-TO-SIDE JUMP REPS: 60 SEC. Jump a few inches to your left as you swing the rope. Then to your right. Get into a rhythm. 3 BACKWARD JUMP REPS: 60 SEC. Swing the rope backward for each jump. 4 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – LEFT REPS: 60 SEC. Jump on one foot; land softly. 5 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – RIGHT REPS: 60 SEC. Jump on the other foot. REST 120 SEC",

THE BEST 30-MINUTE WORKOUT WORKOUT #98 BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S. The best way to get more out of y our workouts is to set a time limit for y ourself. Racing the clock forces y ou to work harder, faster, and more efficiently . Ev ery second counts.

    "content": "You’re about to find out how to use EDT to sculpt a great body when y ou hav e time for nothing less. HO W IT WO RKS Here’s how EDT works. First, set a time limit—in this case, 30 minutes. Pick two different body parts y ou want to train that don’t compete with each other; for example, chest and back or hamstrings and thighs. A pair like chest and shoulders would not work because it inv olv es the same muscles and will fatigue y ou too fast. Choose an exercise for each body part and a weight that allows you 10–12 reps for each. Begin alternating sets of the two moves, resting as little as possible between sets. Go a few reps short of failure on every set. Continue until 30 minutes is up. Make note of the rest periods you took between sets and the total number of reps you performed. The next time you repeat the workout, try to improve your performance without extending the time frame. At right are examples of EDT supersets you can use.

Well-rounded fitness means being both strong and conditioned, but a tight schedule usually causes either weights or cardio to get left out of y our program. The answer is to combine them both in one densely packed circuit. HO W IT WO RKS A lthough y ou’ll train for only a fraction of the time that most guy s sweat it out in gy ms, y ou won’t sacrifice big gains in this workout. The brisk pace will double as cardio, and the sequencing has another adv antage as well—mov ing from smaller to larger muscle groups enhances the way y our muscles are recruited, resulting in greater strength and muscle gains.

If y ou’re the ty pe of guy who makes excuses and misses workouts, y ou’re going to hate this plan.

C omplete as many reps as y ou can of each exercise, and count them. Stop a set when y our form breaks down, and rest as needed. Make note of y our total number of reps for the workout. Each time y ou repeat the workout with the same time period, try to complete more total reps. For example, if you worked out 10 minutes on Monday and then 25 minutes on Wednesday but could manage only 10 minutes again on Friday, try to get more work done in Friday’s session than in Monday’s. Try to perform the workout four to six times per week. 1 PRISONER SQUAT Place your hands behind your head, interlacing your fingers. Stand with your feet shoulder width and your toes turned slightly out. Squat as low as you can. 2 SEAL JUMP Perform a jumping jack, reaching your arms out 90 degrees to your sides as your legs spread. When you jump your legs back in, clap your hands together in front of you. 3 PUSHUP Place your hands on the floor at shoulder width. Keeping your abs braced and your body in a straight line, squeeze your shoulder blades together and lower your body until your chest is an inch above the floor. 4 LATERAL JUMP Jump to your right side and land on your right foot.

    "content": "Izumi Tabata, Ph.D., a researcher at the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Toky o, Japan, found that brutally intense interv al workouts lasting just four minutes improv ed endurance better than more conv entional interv al training—and increased fat burning. We know y ou’v e got the time for this workout, and to giv e y ou one less excuse to skip it, we’ll giv e y ou only one exercise to do. HO W IT WO RKS Tabata workouts are designed according to a work-to-rest ratio of 2:1. You go as hard as y ou can for, say , 20 seconds, rest 10, and then repeat. You can choose one or sev eral exercises to use for Tabatas. We’v e prescribed just the burpee. A total-body exercise equally fav ored and dreaded by martial artists and soldiers, the burpee tires y ou out faster than probably any other body -weight mov ement. It will make the ensuing four minutes the slowest of y our life. DIREC TIO NS Perform burpees for 20 seconds. Don’t worry about counting reps—just set a timer and do as many as y ou can. Then rest 10 seconds, and repeat for four minutes. O v er time, y ou can add time to the work interv al, but keep the ratio of work to rest at 2:1 (so if y ou build up to doing burpees for 30 seconds, rest 15 seconds between sets). BURPEE Stand with feet shoulder width and bend down and place your hands on the floor. Now shoot your legs behind you quickly so you’re in the top of a pushup position.

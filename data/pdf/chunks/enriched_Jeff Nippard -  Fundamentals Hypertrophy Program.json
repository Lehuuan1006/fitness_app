JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 6 ABOUT THIS PROGRAM WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS Before we dive into the anatomy and architecture behind the training program itself, I want to make it clear what this training manual is intended to accomplish. As I’ll repeat throughout this document, the primary goal of The Fundamentals Program is to establish a solid strength base with specifically selected foundational exercises. There are three separate 8-week programs included: a full body routine (3 days per week), an upper/lower routine (4 days per week) and a bodypart split routine (5 days per week). The level of volume and the types of exercises included in each routine are very similar, meaning that the three routines are equally appropriate regardless of your experience level. In other words, you will see the same results running either of the three routines in whatever order you see fit and according to your schedule or your training preferences. All three are included to provide variety, so that you can JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 7 pick a routine that suits your needs best and, once you run through it, you have the option of running another two unique programs for 8 weeks a piece. WHAT THIS PROGRAM ISN’T This Fundamentals Training Program manual is not intended to be an all-inclusive resource for all things training related. I initially wrote this document as a supplement to my Training Fundamentals YouTube Series, meaning that there will be information covered in the series that won’t be recapitulated here. At the time of writing, I plan to release The Fundamentals Book (title subject to change) later in 2018 or early 2019 which will cover anything and everything training related from A to Z",

    "content": "The main purpose of this program is to provide three tangible, actionable programs that can be executed without having to understand all of the underpinnings of my programming science and philosophy. With that said, there is still plenty to chew on here: just about 90 pages in total, including a full blown anatomy section (something I didn’t have the chance to cover in my Fundamentals YouTube Series in detail), a section explaining the specific programming principles at play (volume, intensity, frequency, etc.), video links for technique demonstration for each exercise and 26 unique scientific references. Still, if you’re an unexperienced new trainee, I would strongly recommend watching my Fundamentals YouTube Series, since it will help strengthen your grasp of the concepts being discussed here. This program isn’t intended to teach or instruct you on basic lifting technique and assumes you already have a basic understanding of how to perform the exercises included with proper form. If there are any exercises you aren’t familiar or confident with, please refer to the video links section for demonstration. It also comes strongly recommended that you have a personal trainer, coach or experienced friend provide feedback on your technique for new movements.

Ride side: superficial; left side: deep (anterior view) JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 10 FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY It is important to understand the functional anatomy and biomechanics of the main muscles we’ll be targeting before we can understand how to best train them. Functional anatomy determines what muscles can do. There are two things to consider when looking at a muscle’s functional anatomy – its origin and insertion. Muscles attach to bone by tendons from at least two points. The origin is the fixed attachment which does not move and the insertion is the attachment which moves closer to the origin when a muscle contracts. This is the contracting phase, referred to as the concentric phase (also known as the “positive” phase), which is normally followed by the eccentric phase (lowering the weight – also known as the “negative” phase). QUADRICEPS: The quadriceps (“quads” for short) are comprised of four muscles, often referred to as “heads”: the vastus lateralis (“quad sweep”), vastus medialis (“tear drop”), rectus femoris (the middle portion of your upper thigh), and vastus intermedius (which runs underneath the rectus femoris). The quads act to extend the knee, taking the leg from a bent position to a straight position. Each muscle of the quad has its own unique insertion which we won’t worry about too much here. Just remember that the main action of the quads is to extend (straighten) the knee. ORIGIN: The vasti muscles originate on the body of femur (“thigh bone”). The rectus femoris originates on the illium of the “hip bone” INSERTION: Tibial tuberosity EXERCISES: Squat, walking lunge, leg extension Figure 3: Quadriceps Anatomy JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 11 HAMSTRINGS: The hamstrings are actually a complex of four muscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris (which consists of a long head and a short head)",

ORIGIN: The semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and long head of the biceps femoris originate on the ischial tuberosity. The short head of the biceps femoris originates on the linea aspera. INSERTION: The semitendinosus and semimembranosus both insert on the tibia, while both the long and short heads of the biceps femoris insert at the fibula. EXERCISES: Deadlift, romanian deadlift, leg curl Figure 4: Hamstrings Anatomy JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 12 GLUTEALS: The gluteals (or “glutes”) are also a complex of muscles consisting of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. As the name suggests, the gluteus maximus is the largest of the three, followed by the gluteus medius, and the smallest gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus has multiple origins including the pelvis, sacrum, coccyx, and thoracolumbar fascia and multiple insertions including the upper femur and IT band. Because of this, it is able to perform a wide variety of functions, but primarily: - Hip extension (push your hips forward) - Hip abduction (move your thigh away from the midline) - Hip external rotation (rotating your thigh bone outwards) - Posterior pelvic tilt (tucking your butt “in”) The smaller glute medius still occupies a hefty portion of the rear hip musculature and functions primarily as a stabilizer during dynamic movement and as a hip abductor. It originates on the pelvis and inserts on the femur. It is most effectively trained with exercises that require a high degree of stability, especially unilateral movements such as walking lunges, and exercises that train hip abduction, such as machine hip abductions. ORIGIN: The gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus originate on the ilium. INSERTION: The gluteus maximus and gluteus minimus insert to the iliotibial tract (IT band) and the gluteal tuberosity on the femur",

The pectoralis major can be divided into two heads: the clavicular head or “upper chest” (which originates at the clavicle) and the sternal head or “lower chest” (which originates at the sternum). The pecs act to adduct the upper arm (bring the upper arm across the body), and to internally rotate the shoulder joint. The clavicular fibers also aid in shoulder flexion (raising your upper arm up), but the sternal fibers do not. ORIGIN: The pectoralis major originates on the sternum and clavicle. The pectoralis minor originates on the 3rd-5th ribs. INSERTION: The pectoralis major inserts on the humerus. The pectoralis minor inserts to the coracoid process (front of your shoulder). EXERCISES: Bench press, dumbbell incline press, cable flies, dips, military press Figure 6: Pectoral Anatomy JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 14 BACK: The back is comprised of a massive web of muscles, so for the sake of simplicity we will only look at the largest back muscles. The latissimus dorsi (lats for short) is a big muscle which runs from just underneath your arm pit all the way down to the bottom of your back. The lats primarily act to extend the shoulder (bring your upper arm downward) and adduct the shoulder (moving your elbows towards your mid back). The trapezius (traps for short), is another large muscle running from the base of the skull down to the middle of your inner back. When people think about the traps, they tend to only think of the upper fibers, but the middle and lower fibers take up a very large surface area as well",

A: Bodybuilding is a marathon, not a sprint. It can be difficult to accurately determine if you are making visual progress day-to-day or even week-to-week. Taking physique progress photos every 4-6 weeks and comparing them side by side is a good way to detect visual differences that you simply wouldn’t notice in the mirror. But ultimately, because of the relationship between strength gain and muscle gain, the main metric I want you to use for tracking your progress is strength. If you’re getting stronger, you’re progressing. It is strongly recommended to log every workout either in writing (print the program out or use a separate notebook) or in an app, so you don’t have to rely on memory to keep track of personal strength records. Taking body measurements a few times a year can also be helpful (arms, thigh, waist, neck) but simply focusing on steady strength progression will be your best proxy for determining muscular progress. F.A.Q. JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 21 2: How much muscle can I expect to gain? A: How you respond to training will be largely determined by genetic factors. As a rough ballpark estimate for untrained male individuals, 1-2 lbs of muscle gain per month is reasonable (12-24 lbs of muscle gained in your first year). For early intermediates with about 1 year of lifting experience, progress will likely slow down to roughly 0.5-1 lbs of muscle gain per month (6-12 lbs of muscle gained in your second year). For practical purposes, women can divide muscle gain estimates in half. 3: What gym equipment should I use? A: Gym equipment is optional as there are no required pieces of equipment to gain muscle and increase strength",

When should I wear it? A: Optionally use a lifting belt for working sets on exercises like squats, deadlifts and overhead (military) presses. Strength is a specific skill, so practice every rep in exactly the same way (meaning, if you’re going to use a belt at all, use it consistently and for the same movements). I wouldn’t recommend wearing on a belt on light warm-up sets. 5: I am not getting sore from my workouts. Is the program not working? A: Muscle soreness is largely attributed to eccentric contractions [22] and long muscle length contractions [23]. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) isn’t required for hypertrophy to occur, but the associated muscle damage might play a role in hypertrophy [24]. With that said, the main goal of the program is to establish a strength foundation, not to get you feeling sore. In fact, reduced soreness over time indicates that your body is adapting and recovering, which is actually a good thing for continued progress. 6: I am getting very sore from my workouts. Should I skip the gym until I am not sore? A: You may experience increased soreness when you first begin the program because it is presenting a new stress to your body",

    "content": "Foam rolling can help reduce DOMS [25] and increase ROM [26], so if you are consistently getting sore week after week, consider adding a short 3-5 minute foam rolling routine at the end of the workouts. Otherwise, training while sore is not inherently problematic for muscle growth unless it puts you at an increased risk of injury. If you’re having a difficult time getting into position for any of the planned exercises, or finding it difficult to complete a full ROM due to pain, do not train. Otherwise, in the case of mild soreness, perform a slightly longer warm up for each exercise and use your own discretion with avoiding injury being a top priority. One extra rest day will not set you back very far, but a serious injury will. JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 23 7: Should I eat in a caloric deficit, maintenance, or surplus while running this program? A: Eating in a slight caloric surplus will yield the best results and best recovery, however, if your main goal is fat loss, eating in a caloric deficit will be necessary. As a beginner, you can continue to make strength and size progress while in a moderate caloric deficit and achieve body recomposition (lose fat and build muscle at the same time) if protein intake is sufficient (0.8-1g/lb bodyweight as a ballpark). 8: The warm-up isn’t enough for me. Can I add to it? A: You can add warm-up exercises to the protocol but your warm-up shouldn’t take any longer than 10-20 minutes. It is important to stay injury-free, so don’t rush into your workout. 9. Why is there such little exercise variation from week to week? A: Changing exercises from week to week is more likely to flatten out the strength progression curve. While there is some variation from week to week, most exercises are kept constant to ensure both progression (by adding volume incrementally to these specific movements) and mastery of exercise form and technique. If after 8 weeks you feel like you need to switch things up, then you can run one of the other 2 programs included in this manual",

A: Since adherence and sustainability are arguably the most important factors for long term success, it is important to start with a program that you think you will enjoy and actually stick to. Have a look through the 3 programs and go with the one that looks most appealing to you. I am a big fan of the upper/lower split personally, so if you are totally unsure, that would be a good one to start with. JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 24 11. What do I do after I finished the program? A: You have the option of running back through the same program again for another 8 weeks or moving on to one of the other splits provided. After the 1-2 year mark of running these programs, you will likely want to graduate on to one of my Intermediate Programs. 12. What are the blank boxes in the middle of each program for? A: They are for you to track your weights each week, so you can focus on strength progression from week 1 to week 8. Of course, this will only work if you print the program out. The other option would be to keep a notebook and simply pencil in your lifts each week. Keeping up with this habit of tracking is going to be an extremely important part of your success on this program. Please direct all other question to info@strcng.com.

JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 25 Before we look at exactly how you should warm-up, it’s important to consider what the warm-up portion of your training session serves to accomplish. Warming up should function to increase your core body temperature, which improves performance [1] [2]. Your circadian rhythm also helps determine your core body temperature at any given point in time. When you wake up, your core body temperature is at its lowest, and it increases throughout the day",

    "content": "When you wake up, your core body temperature is at its lowest, and it increases throughout the day. There seems to be a “sweet spot” for core body temperature, so doing 5-10 minutes of low-moderate intensity cardio is especially prudent if you exercise early in the morning [3]. Secondly, warm-ups serve as a way to increase muscle activation. Doing dynamic warm-ups (exercises and drills which take you through a range of motion) can improve performance and force output [4]. Don’t view your warm-up as just “going through the motions.” The goal is to always be very mindful about the muscles you WARM UP JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 26 are contracting and the bodily movements you’re doing. A proper and complete warm up helps strengthen this mindfulness. Lastly, foam rolling has been shown to reduce DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) [5]. Brief foam rolling with a specific focus on “tight areas” before a session can improve range of motion [6] and prevent injury [7]. Light foam rolling for 2-3 minutes prior to lifting is recommended. Before beginning with your working weight for the first exercise for each bodypart, perform a basic loading pyramid where you pyramid up in weight with 1-3 light sets, getting progressively heavier until you reach your working weight for that exercise.

While I encourage you to run the program as written and include all of the listed exercises if possible, in the case of risking an injury or flare up, it is always wise to avoid exercises that you think may cause pain and stick to exercises that you can perform safely. The exercises below are the ones that most commonly require substitutions. When making a substitution, keep the sets, reps, rest times, etc. the same and simply swap out one movement for the other as you feel appropriate. SQUAT: Leg Press + 15 reps of lower back extensions (for example, if you were programmed to do 3 sets of 8 reps on the squat, but are unable to squat, substitute squats for 3 sets of 8 on the leg press and then add an additional 3 sets of 15 reps of lower back extensions)",

    "content": "For this reason, this program focuses primarily on building a solid strength base with carefully selected, fundamental movements. The exercises included here should be mastered before moving on to other more complex (or more niched) variations. The program sticks mainly to compound movements (exercises which use multiple joints and go through a large range of motion). Since compound movements move multiple joints, they generally stimulate more overall muscle mass than isolation movements (single joint movements) and as such optimize your time and effort investment in the gym. PROGRAM EXPLAINED JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 81 HOW DO I PROGRESS? Progressive overload is generally regarded as the most important programming principle for all strength and size related goals. Because of the correlation between muscle size and strength [8] we simply cannot ignore the interplay between getting stronger and getting bigger, especially when building a solid foundation. In this program, progression will occur in the form of adding weight (load) or adding reps with the same amount of weight. This is what is usually meant by “progressive overload”. It can also been seen as using better form with the same weight, using a larger range of motion, improving the mind-muscle connection, etc. Adding weight to the bar/dumbbell/machine will be dependent on your experience level. For practical purposes, we can split this up into three different tiers relative to training experience: 1. An untrained individual (less than 3 months of consistent training experience) 2. A beginner (3-9 months of consistent training experience) 3. Early-intermediates (9-18 months of consistent training experience) For an untrained individual, the goal should be to focus more on mastering perfect technique rather than adding weight. I recommend using the same weight for at least 3 weeks straight to ensure technique mastery before increasing the resistance",

    "content": "Developing a technique-base is even more foundational than developing a strength base since training with poor technique can lead to injury and halted progress. Once exercise technique can be executed properly and you graduate to beginner territory, you can aim to make small increases in weight week to week, as your nervous system begins to engrain new motor patterns [9]. JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 82 As a beginner, you can and should expect to make very consistent strength gains. While you may be tempted to make big jumps in weight as your strength and confidence improves, you should stick to a simple linear progression: consistently add the same load over a period of time rather than making big jumps less frequently. When compared to nonlinear periodization (more commonly known as undulating periodization), linear periodization is equally effective for gaining strength [10] and since lifting form changes with different percentages of your maximum strength [11], it is safer and more reliable to make smaller jumps from week to week. Keep in mind that adding just 5lbs total to the bar per week for only 26 weeks (6 months) will yield a 130 lb increase in strength. For a low-intermediate, these consistent, linear strength gains will slowly start to diminish. This is when using rate of perceived exertion (RPE for short) will come in handy. RPE is a scale from 1-10: 1 meaning there’s ~10% of maximal effort, and 10 meaning there’s 100% maximal effort. Since training close to (but not necessarily all the way to) concentric muscular failure is important for both strength and hypertrophy [12], we will be aiming for an RPE of 6 or above on all sets in this program. This generally means no more than 4 reps are being “left in the tank”. Another way to see RPE is reps in reserve (or RIR). RIR is inversely related to RPE. A 10RPE is an all-out set, meaning you have 0 reps left in reserve. A 9RPE is a very hard set, meaning you have ~1-2 reps left in reserve",

    "content": "A 9RPE is a very hard set, meaning you have ~1-2 reps left in reserve. An 8RPE is still a difficult set, meaning you have 2-3 reps in reserve. And so on. RPE has been shown to be an effective method for choosing a load, even when compared to a percent of 1-rep maximum [13], so it is important to start developing this skill. The closely related Reps In Reserve (RIR) methodology has also proven to be a viable tool for predicting load as a relates to effort, including in beginners [14]. To progress using the RPE method, you should use a set load and only increase the JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 83 weight when the RPE decreases by 1 point (the set feels ~10% easier than it did when you first started using that load). WHAT IS THE MIND-MUSCLE CONNECTION? HOW DO I DEVELOP IT? The mind-muscle connection is the act of focusing on using the target muscle to move the weight (not just “going through the motions”). Research has shown increased muscle activation when subjects are instructed to use “internal cueing” (such as squeezing your glutes as hard as possible to get the barbell to move in a hip thrust) when compared to “external cueing” (such as simply moving the barbell upwards) [15]. The mind-muscle connection is a skill that takes time to develop, but strength level doesn’t seem to impact its development [16], meaning you should begin to cultivate it early. Generally speaking, I think that the mind muscle connection should be used only sparingly (if at all) on squats, deadlifts and overhead presses as these are highly technique-focused exercises that will activate a large muscle mass regardless of attentional focus. For these movements, it is better to focus on the movement of your entire body and simply execute the exercise with proper technique through a full range of motion. For all isolation exercises and any remaining compound exercises, you can use the mind-muscle connection to increase activation of the target muscle as you feel appropriate",

    "content": "JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 84 FREQUENCY The main thing we can conclude from the scientific literature on frequency is that training each muscle twice per week is better than only training each muscle once per week [17]. One potential limitation of the training frequency research is that most studies are volume equated, meaning the subjects are actually doing the same amount of total work. In the real world, it is much less likely that volumes would be equal when frequencies are different. Higher frequency training typically allows us to do more volume within a training week. To illustrate this point, just imagine the fatigue differences between doing 3 sets of squats 3 days per week (somewhat manageable) compared to doing 9 sets of squats in a single session (brutal). So what the frequency research really tells us is that: TRAINING VARIABLES JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 85 1. There is probably no special benefit to training a muscle more than twice per week with the same amount of volume. 2. Training a muscle more than once per week is more optimal for hypertrophy, even when volume is the same. INTENSITY (EFFORT AND LOAD) How much effort should you put into each set? As an untrained individual, intensity (effort) should be lower than it should be for a more highly trained individual. If you feel like you could be training a bit harder, you are probably working at the perfect pace. Since strength is neuromuscular, developing poor technique habits from pushing sets too close to failure can put you at an increased risk for injury and engrain bad lifting habits. For an untrained individual, keeping sets closer to an RPE of 5-7 is recommended. As you begin to progress toward the late beginner/early intermediate stage, having mastered proper lifting technique, you can begin to exert yourself harder and benefit from taking more sets closer to failure. For this individual, taking sets to an RPE of 7-8 is usually the sweet spot",

    "content": "For this individual, taking sets to an RPE of 7-8 is usually the sweet spot. How much weight (load) do you lift? How heavy do you go? As previously mentioned, the primary goal of this program is to develop a strong foundation. RPE is a helpful tool for both load selection and for determining how much effort goes into each set. An appropriately selected weight generally means that you can safely perform the target reps with proper form and at the prescribed RPE. JEFF NIPPARD FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM 86 VOLUME Volume is a central factor determining hypertrophic potential. Volume can be viewed as both volume per-session and volume per-week. Per-session volume requirements are actually very low, with research showing that just one set can serve as an “adequate” stimulus for generating a hypertrophic response. [18] However, while this low volume approach can cause some hypertrophy, multiple sets (3-5 sets) per muscle group are thought to be required to maximize hypertrophy [19]. It is important to note that not all volume is created equal and more volume isn’t always the answer. One 2018 study comparing 5 sets of 10 reps versus 10 sets of 10 reps on the squat actually showed greater strength responses in the 5 sets group, despite using half the volume. Not only that - the 10 x 10 group actually lost muscle (on average) in their legs [20]. So there does appear to be a “volume limit” past which further increases in volume are not helpful for stimulating more hypertrophy. James Krieger recommends a minimum of 10 sets per week per muscle group [21], with 10-15 sets per bodypart per week being a good ballpark estimate for maximizing hypertrophy in nearly all beginners and early intermediates",

In fact, the most essential yogic concepts can be derived from observing the cell’s form and function. This chapter explores breath anatomy from a yogic perspective, using the cell as a starting point. Yoga Lessons From a Cell Cells are the smallest building blocks of life, from single-celled plants to multitrillion-celled animals. The human body, which is made up of roughly 100 trillion cells, begins as a single, newly fertilized cell. A cell consists of three parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. The membrane separates the cell’s external environment, which contains nutrients that the cell requires, from its internal environment, which consists of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nutrients have to get through the membrane, and once inside, the cell metabolizes these nutrients and turns them into the energy that fuels its life functions. As a result of this metabolic activity, waste gets generated that must somehow get back out through the membrane. Any impairment in the membrane’s ability to let nutrients in or waste out will result in the death of the cell via starvation or toxicity. This observation that living things take in nutrients provides a good basis for understanding the term prana, which refers to what nourishes a living thing. Prana refers not only to what is brought in as nourishment but also to the action that brings it in.1 Of course, there has to be a complementary force. The yogic concept that complements prana is apana, which refers to what is eliminated by a living thing as well as the action of elimination.2 These two fundamental yogic terms—prana and apana—describe the essential activities of life. Successful function, of course, expresses itself in a particular form. Certain conditions have to exist in a cell for nutrition (prana) to enter and waste (apana) to exit",

    "content": "Certain conditions have to exist in a cell for nutrition (prana) to enter and waste (apana) to exit. The membrane’s structure has to allow things to pass in and out of it—it has to be permeable (see figure 1.1). It can’t be so perme- able, however, that the cell wall loses its integrity; otherwise, the cell will either explode from the pressures within or implode from the pressures outside. 1 The Sanskrit word prana is derived from pra, a prepositional prefix meaning “before,” and an, a verb meaning “to breathe,” “to blow,” and “to live.” Here, prana is not being capitalized, because it refers to the functional life processes of a single entity. The capitalized Prana is a more universal term that is used to designate the manifestation of all creative life force. 2 The Sanskrit word apana is derived from apa, which means “away,” “off,” and “down,” and an, which means “to blow,” “to breathe,” and “to live.” Figure 1.1 The cell’s membrane must balance contain- ment (stability) with permeability. 2 Yoga Anatomy In the cell (and all living things, for that matter), the principle that balances permeability is stability. The yogic terms that reflect these polarities are sthira3 and sukha.4 All successful living things must balance containment and permeability, rigidity and plasticity, persistence and adaptability, space and boundaries.5 You have seen that observing the cell, the most basic unit of life, illuminates the most basic concepts in yoga: prana/apana and sthira/sukha. Next is an examination of the structure and function of the breath using these concepts as a guide. Prana and Apana The body’s pathways for nutrients and waste are not as simple as those of a cell, but they are not so complex that you can’t grasp the concepts as easily. Figure 1.2 shows a simplified version of the nutritional and waste pathways. It shows how the human system is open at the top and at the bottom",

    "content": "It shows how the human system is open at the top and at the bottom. You take in prana, nourishment, in solid and liquid form at the top of the system: It enters the alimentary canal, goes through the digestive process, and after a lot of twists and turns, the resulting waste moves down and out. It has to go down to get out because the exit is at the bottom. So, the force of apana, when it’s acting on solid and liquid waste, has to move down to get out. You also take in prana in gaseous form: The breath, like solid and liquid nutrition, enters at the top. But the inhaled air remains above the diaphragm in the lungs (see figure 1.3), where it exchanges gases with the capillaries at the alveoli. The waste gases in the lungs need to get out—but they need to get back out the same way they came in. This is why it is said that apana must be able to operate freely both upward and downward, depending on what type of waste it’s acting on. That is also why any inability to reverse apana’s downward push will result in an incomplete exhalation. The ability to reverse apana’s downward action is a very basic and useful skill that can be acquired through yoga train- ing, but it is not something that most people are able to do right away. Pushing downward is the way that most people are accustomed to operating their apana because whenever there’s anything within the body that needs to be disposed, humans tend to squeeze in and push down. That is why most beginning yoga students, when asked to exhale completely, will squeeze in and push down their breathing muscles as if they’re urinating or defecating. 3 The Sanskrit word sthira means “firm,” “hard,” “solid,” “compact,” “strong,” “unfluctuating,” “durable,” “lasting,” and “permanent.” English words such as stay, stand, stable, and steady are likely derived from the Indo-European root that gave rise to the Sanskrit term",

Figure 1.2 Solid and liquid nutrition (blue) enter at the top of the system and exit as waste at the bottom. Gaseous nutrition and waste (red) enter and exit at the top. dynamics of breathing 3 Sukha and Dukha The pathways must be clear of obstructing forces in order for prana and apana to have a healthy relationship. In yogic language, this region must be in a state of sukha, which literally translates as “good space.” “Bad space” is referred to as dukha, which is commonly translated as “suf- fering.”6 This model points to the fundamental method- ology of all classical yoga practice, which attends to the blockages, or obstructions, in the system to improve function. The basic idea is that when you make more “good space,” your pranic forces will flow freely and restore normal function. This is in contrast to any model that views the body as missing something essential, which has to be added from the outside. This is why it has been said that yoga therapy is 90 percent about waste removal. Another practical way of applying this insight to the field of breath training is the observation: If you take care of the exhalation, the inhalation takes care of itself. Breathing, Gravity, and Yoga Keeping in the spirit of starting from the beginning, let’s look at some of the things that happen at the very start of life. In utero, oxygen is delivered through the umbilical cord. The mother does the breathing",

    "content": "In utero, oxygen is delivered through the umbilical cord. The mother does the breathing. There is no air and very little blood in the lungs when in utero because the lungs are non- functional and mostly collapsed. The circulatory system is largely reversed, with oxygen-rich blood flowing through the veins and oxygen-depleted blood flowing through the arteries. Humans even have blood flowing through vessels that won’t exist after birth, because they will seal off and become ligaments. Being born means being severed from the umbilical cord—the lifeline that sustained you for nine months. Suddenly, and for the first time, you need to engage in actions that will ensure continued survival. The very first of these actions declares your physical and physiological independence. It is the first breath, and it is the most important and forceful inhalation you will ever take in your life. That first inhalation was the most important one because the initial inflation of the lungs causes essential changes to the entire circulatory system, which had previously been geared toward receiving oxygenated blood from the mother. The first breath causes blood to surge into the lungs, the right and left sides of the heart to separate into two pumps, and the specialized vessels of fetal circulation to shut down and seal off. That first inhalation is the most forceful one you will ever take because it needs to over- come the initial surface tension of your previously collapsed and amniotic-fluid-filled lung Figure 1.3 The pathway that air takes into and out of the body. 6 The Sanskrit word sukha is derived from su (meaning “good”) and kha (meaning “space”). In this context (paired with dukha), it refers to a state of well-being, free of obstacles. Like the “good axle hole,” a person needs to have “good space” at his or her center. The Sanskrit word dukha is derived from dus (meaning “bad”) and kha (meaning “space”)",

It is generally translated as “suffering”; also, “uneasy,” “uncomfortable,” “unpleasant,” and “difficult.” 4 Yoga Anatomy tissue. The force required (called negative inspiratory force) is three to four times greater than that of a normal inhalation. Another first-time experience that occurs at the moment of birth is the weight of the body in space. Inside the womb, you’re in a weightless, fluid-filled environment. Then, suddenly, your entire universe expands because you’re out—you’re free. Now, your body can move freely in space, your limbs and head can move freely in relation to your body, and you must be supported in gravity. Because adults are perfectly willing to swaddle babies and move them from place to place, stability and mobility may not seem to be much of an issue so early in life, but they are. The fact is, right away you have to start doing something—you have to find nourishment, which involves the complex action of simultaneously breathing, sucking, and swallowing. All of the muscles involved in this intricate act of survival also create your first postural skill—supporting the weight of the head. This necessarily involves the coordinated action of many muscles, and—as with all postural skills—a balancing act between mobilization and stabilization. Postural development continues from the head downward, until you begin walking (after about a year), culminating with the completion of your lumbar curve (at about 10 years of age). To summarize, the moment you’re born, you’re confronted by two forces that were not present in utero: breath and gravity. To thrive, you need to reconcile those forces for as long as you draw breath on this planet. The practice of yoga can be seen as a way of consciously exploring the relationship between breath and posture, so it’s clear that yoga can help you to deal with this fundamental challenge",

    "content": "To use the language of yoga, life on this planet requires an integrated relationship between breath (prana/apana) and posture (sthira/sukha). When things go wrong with one, by definition they go wrong with the other. The prana/apana concept is explored with a focus on the breathing mechanism. Chapter 2 covers the sthira/sukha concept by focusing on the spine. The rest of the book examines how the breath and spine come together in the practice of yoga postures. Breathing Defined Breathing is the process of taking air into and expelling it from the lungs. This is a good place to start, but let’s define the “process” being referred to. Breathing—the passage of air into and out of the lungs—is movement, one of the fundamental activities of living things. Specifically, breathing involves movement in two cavities. Movement in Two Cavities The simplified illustration of the human body in figure 1.4 shows that the torso consists of two cavities, the thoracic and the abdominal. These cavities share some properties, and they have important distinctions as well. Both contain vital organs: The thoracic contains the heart and lungs, and the abdominal contains the stomach, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, small and large intestines, kidneys, and bladder, among others. Both cavities are bounded posteriorly by the spine. Both open at one end to the external environment—the thoracic at the top, and the abdominal at the bottom. Both share an important structure, the diaphragm (it forms the roof of the abdominal cavity and the floor of the thoracic cavity). Another important shared property of the two cavities is that they are mobile—they change shape. It is this shape-changing ability that is most relevant to breathing, because without this movement, the body cannot breathe at all. Although both the abdominal and thoracic cavities change shape, there is an important structural difference in how they do so. The abdominal cavity changes shape like a flexible, fluid-filled structure such as a water balloon",

    "content": "The abdominal cavity changes shape like a flexible, fluid-filled structure such as a water balloon. When you squeeze one end of a water balloon, the other end bulges. That is dynamics of breathing 5 because water is noncompressible. Your hand’s action only moves the fixed volume of water from one end of the flexible container to the other. The same principle applies when the abdominal cavity is com- pressed by the movements of breathing; a squeeze in one region produces a bulge in another. That is because in the context of breathing, the abdominal cavity changes shape, but not volume. In the context of life processes other than breathing, the abdominal cavity does change volume. If you drink a gallon of liquid or eat a big meal, the overall volume of the abdominal cavity will increase as a result of expanded abdominal organs (stomach, intestines, bladder). Any increase of volume in the abdominal cavity will produce a corresponding decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity. That is why it’s harder to breathe after a big meal, before a big bowel movement, or when pregnant. In contrast to the abdominal cavity, the thoracic cavity changes both shape and volume; it behaves as a flexible gas-filled container, similar to an accordion bellows. When you squeeze an accordion, you create a reduction in the volume of the bellows and air is forced out. When you pull the bellows open, its volume increases and the air is pulled in. This is because the accordion is compressible and expandable. The same is true of the thoracic cavity, which, unlike the abdominal cavity and its contents, can change its shape and volume. Volume and Pressure Volume and pressure are inversely related: When volume increases, pressure decreases, and when volume decreases, pressure increases. Because air always flows toward areas of lower pressure, increasing the volume inside the thoracic cavity (think of an accordion) will decrease pressure and cause air to flow into it. This is an inhalation",

    "content": "This is an inhalation. It is interesting to note that in spite of how it feels when you inhale, you are not pulling air into the body. On the contrary, air is pushed into the body by atmospheric pressure that always surrounds you. The actual force that gets air into the lungs is outside of the body. The energy you expend in breathing produces a shape change that lowers the pressure in your chest cavity and permits the air to be pushed into the body by the weight of the planet’s atmosphere. Let’s now imagine the thoracic and abdominal cavities as an accordion stacked on top of a water balloon. This illustration gives a sense of the relationship of the two cavities in breath- ing; movement in one will necessarily result in movement in the other. Recall that during an inhalation (the shape change permitting air to be pushed into the lungs by the planet’s atmospheric pressure), the thoracic cavity expands its volume. This pushes downward on the abdominal cavity, which changes shape as a result of the pressure from above. During relaxed, quiet breathing (such as while sleeping), an exhalation is a passive reversal of this process. The thoracic cavity and lung tissue—which have been stretched open during the inhalation—spring back to their initial volume, pushing the air out and returning the thoracic cavity to its previous shape. This is referred to as a passive recoil. Any reduction Figure 1.4 Breathing is thoracoabdominal shape change. Inhalation on left, exhalation on right. 6 Yoga Anatomy in the elasticity of these tissues will result in a reduction of the body’s ability to exhale pas- sively—leading to a host of respiratory problems. In breathing patterns that involve active exhaling (such as blowing out candles, speak- ing, and singing, as well as various yoga exercises), the musculature surrounding the two cavities contracts in such a way that the abdominal cavity is pushed upward into the tho- racic cavity, or the thoracic cavity is pushed downward into the abdominal cavity, or any combination of the two",

    "content": "Three-Dimensional Shape Changes of Breathing Because the lungs occupy a three-dimensional space in the thoracic cavity, when this space changes shape to cause air movement, it changes shape three-dimensionally. Specifically, an inhalation involves the chest cavity increasing its volume from top to bottom, from side to side, and from front to back, and an exhalation involves a reduction of volume in those three dimensions (see figure 1.5). Figure 1.5 Three-dimensional thoracic shape changes of (a) inhalation and (b) exhalation. Because thoracic shape change is inextricably linked to abdominal shape change, you can also say that the abdominal cavity also changes shape (not volume) in three dimensions—it can be pushed or pulled from top to bottom, from side to side, or from front to back (see figure 1.6). In a living, breathing body, thoracic shape change cannot happen without abdominal shape change. That is why the condition of the abdominal region has such an influence on the quality of your breathing and why the quality of your breathing has a powerful effect on the health of your abdominal organs. Figure 1.6 Changes in abdominal shape during breathing: (a) Inhalation = spinal extension; (b) exhalation = spinal flexion. b a b a dynamics of breathing 7 Expanded Definition of Breathing Based on the information you have so far, here’s an expanded definition of breathing: Breathing, the process of taking air into and expelling it from the lungs, is caused by a three-dimensional changing of shape in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Defining breathing in this manner explains not only what it is but also how it is done. This has profound implications for yoga practice, because it can lead you to examine the supporting, shape-changing structure that occupies the back of the body’s two primary cavities—the spine, which is covered in chapter 2. To understand how a single muscle, the diaphragm, is capable of producing all this move- ment, you now examine it in detail",

    "content": "Diaphragm’s Role in Breathing Just about every anatomy book describes the diaphragm as the principal muscle of breathing. Add the diaphragm to the shape-change definition of breathing to begin your exploration of this remarkable muscle: The diaphragm is the principal muscle that causes three-dimensional shape change in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. To understand how the diaphragm causes this shape change, you will examine its shape and location in the body, where it’s attached, and what is attached to it, as well as its action and relationship to the other muscles of breathing. Shape and Location The diaphragm divides the torso into the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It is the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity. Its structure extends through a wide section of the body—the uppermost part reaches the space between the third and fourth ribs, and its lowest fibers attach to the front of the third lumbar vertebra; “nipple to navel” is one way to describe it. The deeply domed shape of the diaphragm has evoked many images. Some of the most common are a mushroom, a jellyfish, a parachute, and a helmet. It’s important to note that the shape of the diaphragm is created by the organs it encloses and supports. Deprived of its relationship with those organs, its dome would collapse, much like a stocking cap without a head in it. It is also evident that the diaphragm has an asymmetrical double-dome shape, with the right dome rising higher than the left. This is because the liver pushes up from below the right dome, and the heart pushes down from above the left dome. Origin and Insertion The lower edges of the diaphragm’s circumference originate from three distinct regions: the bottom of the sternum, the base of the rib cage, and the front of the lower spine (see figure 1.7). These three regions form a continuous rim of attachment for the diaphragm. The only bony components of this rim are the back of the xiphoid process and the front surfaces of the first three lumbar vertebrae",

    "content": "The majority of the diaphragm (over 90 percent) originates on flexible tissue: the costal cartilage of ribs 6 through 10 and the arcuate ligaments, which bridge the span from the 10th rib’s cartilage to the floating 11th and 12th ribs and from there to the spine. Figure 1.7 Origin and insertion of the diaphragm muscle. 8 Yoga Anatomy All the muscular fibers of the diaphragm rise upward in the body from their origins. They eventually arrive at the flattened, horizontal top of the muscle, the central tendon, into which they insert. In essence, the diaphragm inserts into itself—its own central tendon, which is fibrous noncontractile tissue. Organic Connections The central tendon of the diaphragm is a point of anchorage for the connective tissue that surrounds the thoracic and abdominal organs. The names of these important structures are easily remembered as the three Ps. • Pleura, which surround the lungs • Pericardium, which surrounds the heart • Peritoneum, which surrounds the abdominal organs Thus, it should be clear that the shape-changing activity of these cavities has a profound effect on the movements of the organs they contain. The diaphragm is the primary source of these movements, and the relationship of its healthy functioning to the well-being of the organs is anatomically evident. Actions It is important to remember that the muscular fibers of the diaphragm are oriented primarily along the vertical (up–down) axis of the body, and this is the direction of the muscular action of the muscle. Recall that the horizontal central tendon is noncontractile and can move only in response to the action of the muscular fibers, which insert into it (see figure 1.8). As in any other muscle, the contracting fibers of the diaphragm pull its insertion and origin (the central tendon and the base of the rib cage) toward each other. This muscle action is the fundamental cause of the three-dimensional thoracoabdominal shape changes of breathing",

    "content": "To understand this fact more deeply, the question of whether origin moves toward inser- tion, or insertion moves toward origin, needs to be clarified. As with all muscles, the type of movement the diaphragm produces will depend on which end of the muscle is stable and which is mobile. To use an example of another muscle, the psoas muscle can create hip flexion either by moving the leg toward the front of the spine (as in standing on one leg and flexing the other hip) or by moving the front of the spine toward the leg (as in sit-ups with the legs braced). In both cases, the psoas muscle is doing the same thing— contracting. What differs is which end of the muscle is stable and which is mobile. Just as you can think of the psoas as either a “leg mover” or a “trunk mover,” you can think of the diaphragm as either a “belly bulger” or a “rib cage lifter” (see figure 1.9). The muscular action of the diaphragm is most often associated with a Figure 1.8 The muscle fibers of the dia- phragm all run vertically from their origins to their insertion on the central tendon. dynamics of breathing 9 bulging7 movement in the upper abdomen, which is commonly referred to as a “belly breath,” but this is only the case if the diaphragm’s origin (the base of the rib cage) is stable and its insertion (the central tendon) is mobile (see figure 1.10a). If the central tendon is stabilized and the ribs are free to move, a diaphragmatic contraction will cause an expansion of the rib cage (see figure 1.10b). This is a “chest breath,” which many people believe must be caused by the action of muscles other than the diaphragm. This mistaken idea can create a false dichotomy between diaphrag- matic and “nondiaphragmatic” breathing. The unfortunate result of this error is that many people receiving breath training who exhibit chest movement (rather than belly movement) are told that they are not using the diaphragm, which is false. Except in cases of paralysis, the diaphragm is always used for breathing",

The issue is whether it is being used efficiently. 7 Even though most teachers refer to this diaphragmatic action as an “expansion” of the abdomen, this is incorrect. In the context of breathing, the abdominal cavity does not change volume—only shape; therefore it is more accurate to refer to this movement as a “bulging” of the upper abdomen. Figure 1.9 The diaphragm can be (a) a “belly bulger,” during the belly inhalation, or (b) a “rib cage lifter,” during the chest inhalation. b a Figure 1.10 (a) With the rib stable and the abdominals relaxed, the diaphragm’s contraction lowers the central tendon.

This rarely occurs because the need to stabilize the body’s mass in gravity will cause many of the respiratory stabilizing muscles (which are also postural muscles) to remain active through all phases of breathing. Engine of Three-Dimensional Shape Change The diaphragm is the prime mover of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The specific patterns that arise in yoga asana practice or breathing exercises, however, result from the action of muscles other than the diaphragm that can change the shape of the cavities. These are called accessory muscles. The analogy of a car and its engine is very useful in explaining this principle. The engine is the prime mover of the car. All the movements associated with a car’s operation (including the electrical) are generated in the engine. In the same manner, the three-dimensional, thoracoabdominal shape change of breathing is primarily generated by the diaphragm",

    "content": "When you drive, the only direct control you exert over the function of the engine is the speed of its spinning. You push the gas pedal to make the engine spin faster, and you release the pedal to make it spin slower. Similarly, the only direct volitional control you have over the diaphragm is its timing. You don’t steer your car with its engine. To control the power of the engine and guide it in a particular direction, you need the mechanisms of the transmission, brakes, steering, and suspension. In the same way, you don’t “steer” your breathing with the diaphragm. To control the power of the breath, and guide it into specific patterns, you need the assistance of the accessory muscles. From the standpoint of this engine analogy, the whole notion of “diaphragmatic training” as a way to improve breath function is flawed. After all, you don’t become a better driver by learning only how to work the gas pedal. Most of the skills you acquire in driver training have to do with getting the acceleration of the car to coordinate with steering, braking, and shifting gears. In a similar way, breath training is really “accessory muscle training.” Once all the other musculature of the body is coordinated and integrated with the action of the diaphragm, breathing will be efficient and effective. Additionally, the notion that that diaphragmatic action is limited to abdominal bulging (belly breathing) is as inaccurate as asserting that a car’s engine is only capable of making it go forward—and that some other source of power must govern reverse movement. Just as this automotive error is linked to not understanding the relationship of the car’s engine to its transmission, the breathing error results from not understanding the relationship of the diaphragm to the accessory muscles. Moreover, equating belly movement with proper breathing and chest movement with improper breathing is just as silly as stating that a car is best served by only driving forward at all times",

Accessory Muscles of Respiration Although there is universal agreement that the diaphragm is the principal muscle of breath- ing, there are various, sometimes conflicting ways of categorizing the other muscles that participate in breathing. Using the definition of breathing as thoracoabdominal shape change, you can define any muscle other than the diaphragm that can cause a shape change in the cavities as accessory (see figures 1.11 and 1.12 for example). It’s irrelevant whether the shape change leads to an increase or a decrease of thoracic volume (inhalation or exhala- dynamics of breathing 11 tion), because both sets of muscles can be active during any phase of breathing. An example would be the analysis of a belly breath or a chest breath. In the belly breath, the costal circumference (origin) of the diaphragm is stabilized by the muscles that pull the rib cage downward: the internal intercostals, the transversus thoracis, and others (see figures 1.13 to 1.16). These muscles are universally classified as “exhaling muscles,” but here they actively participate in shaping an inhalation. In the chest breath, the central tendon (insertion) of the diaphragm is stabilized by the abdominal muscles, also regarded as “exhaling muscles,” but in this case, they are clearly acting to produce a pattern of inhaling. It should be noted that in both of these cases, one region of accessory muscle has to be relaxed while the other is active. In the belly breath, the abdominal wall releases, and in the chest breath, the rib cage depressors have to let go. Figure 1.11 The intercostal muscles assist the sliding action of the ribs during respiration. During inhalation (a), the external intercostals contract, and the internal intercostals relax. During exhala- tion (c), the opposite occurs. Figure 1.12 Contrary to appearances, the intercostal spaces remain constant during respiratory movements",

The shortening and lengthening of these fibers in coordination with the contractions of the diaphragm produce the infinitely variable shape changes associated with respiration. As the tone of the diaphragm increases (inhalation), the tone of some abdominal muscles must decrease to allow the diaphragm to move. If you contract all your abdominal muscles at once and try to inhale, you’ll notice that it’s quite difficult because you’ve limited the ability of your abdomen to change shape. Inhalation Contract Relax Neutral Exhalation b a c Inhalation Neutral Exhalation 12 Yoga Anatomy The abdominal group doesn’t affect breathing only by limiting or permitting shape change in the abdominal cavity. Because they also attach directly to the rib cage, the abdominal muscles directly affect its ability to expand. The abdominal muscles that have the most direct effect on breathing are the ones that originate at the same place as the diaphragm, the transversus abdominis (see figure 1.13). This deepest layer of the abdominal wall arises from the costal cartilage at the base of the rib cage’s inner surface. The fibers of the transversus are interdigitated (interwoven) at right angles with those of the diaphragm, whose fibers ascend vertically, whereas those of the transversus run horizontally (see figure 1.14). This makes the transversus abdominis the direct antagonist to the diaphragm’s action of expanding the rib cage. The same layer of horizontal fibers extends upward into the posterior thoracic wall as the tranversus thoracis, a depressor of the sternum. The other layers of the abdominal wall have similar counterparts in the thoracic cavity",

The external obliques turn into the external intercostals, and the internal obliques turn into the internal intercostals (see figure 1.13). Of all these thoracoabdominal layers of muscle, only the external intercostals are capable of increasing thoracic volume. All the others produce a reduction of thoracic volume—either by depressing the rib cage or pushing upward on the central tendon of the diaphragm. Figure 1.13 The continuity of the abdominal and intercostal layers shows how the external obliques turn into the external intercostals, internal obliques turn into the internal intercostals, and the transversus abdominis turns into the transversus thoracis and innermost intercostals.

This inefficiency is the result of the fact that the location and attachment of these muscles do not provide enough leverage on the rib cage, and the usual role of these mus- cles is not respiration. They are primarily neck, shoulder girdle, and arm mobilizers—actions that require them to be stable proximally (toward the core of the body) and mobile distally (toward the periphery of the body). For these muscles to expand the rib cage, this relationship must be reversed—the distal insertions must be stabilized by yet more muscles so the proximal origins can be mobilized",

    "content": "Considering the degree of muscular tension that accessory breathing entails, the net payoff in oxygenation makes it a poor energetic invest- ment. That is why improved breathing is really a result of decreased tension in the accessory mechanism, which allows the diaphragm, with its shape-changing ability, to operate as efficiently as possible. The Other Two Diaphragms Along with the respiratory diaphragm, breathing involves the coordinated action of the pelvic and vocal diaphragms. Of particular interest to yoga practitioners is the action of mula bandha, which is a lifting action produced in the pelvic floor muscles (shown in figure 1.17, a and b) that also includes the lower fibers of the deep abdominal layers. Mula bandha is an action that moves apana upward and stabilizes the central tendon of the diaphragm. Inhaling while this bandha is active requires a release of the attachments of the upper abdominal wall, which permits the diaphragm to lift the base of the rib cage upward. This action is referred to as uddiyana bandha (uddiya means “flying upward”). It’s important to note that the more superficial muscular fibers of the perineum need not be involved in mula bandha, because they contain the anal and urethral sphincters, which are asso- ciated with the downward movement of apana (elimination of solid and liquid waste), as shown in figure 1.18. Figure 1.15 Some of the accessory muscles of respiration: Blue muscles act to reduce thoracic volume, while red muscles help to increase thoracic volume. Figure 1.16 The serratus posterior mus- cles: superior (red) assist thoracic volume expansion, inferior (blue) assist thoracic volume reduction. 14 Yoga Anatomy Vocal Diaphragm The gateway to the respiratory passages is the glottis, shown in figure 1.19, which is not a structure but a space between the vocal folds (cords). Yoga practitioners are accustomed to regulating this space in various ways, based on what they are doing with their breath, voice, and posture",

This occurs in sleep and in the more restful, restorative practices in yoga. When doing breathing exercises that involve deep, rapid movements of breath (such as kapalabhati or bhastrika), the muscles that pull the vocal folds apart contract to create a larger passage for the air movements (see figure 1.20b). When the exercises call for long, deep, slow breaths, the glottis can be partially closed, with only a small opening at the back of the cords (see figure 1.20c). This is the same action that creates whispered speech; in yoga it’s known as ujjayi,8 “the victorious breath.” Figure 1.17 (a) The deepest muscles of the pelvic diaphragm, from above.

In addition to giving more length and texture to the breath, the “valve” of ujjayi creates a kind of back pressure throughout the abdominal and thoracic cavities that can protect the spine during the long, slow flexion and extension movements that occur in vinyasas such as the sun salutations. In yogic terms, these actions of the diaphragms (bandhas) create more sthira (stability) in the body, protecting it from injury by redistributing mechanical stress. An additional effect of moving the body through this resistance is the creation of heat in the system, which can be used in many beneficial ways. These practices are referred to as brahmana,9 which implies heat, expan- sion, and the development of power and strength as well as the ability to withstand stress. Brahmana is also associated with inhaling, nourishment, prana, and the chest region. When relaxing the body in the more supported, horizontal, restorative practices, remember to release the bandhas and glottal constrictions that are associated with vertical postural support. This relaxing side of yoga embodies the qualities of langhana,10 which is associ- ated with coolness, condensation, relaxation, and release as well as the development of sensitivity and inward focus. Langhana is also associated with exhaling, elimination, apana, and the abdominal region. Because the ultimate goal of yoga breath training is to free up the system from habitual, dysfunctional restrictions, the first thing you need to do is free yourself from the idea that there’s a single right way to breathe",

If yoga practice leads you to more integrated, balanced breathing, it’s because it trains your body to freely respond to the demands that you place on it in the various positions and activities that make up your daily life. 9 The Sanskrit root brh can mean “to grow great or strong,” “increase,” “to make big or fat or strong,” and “expand.” 10 Langhana is a term that originates in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, and it refers to practices such as fasting that reduce, or eliminate, elements from the system. 17 yoga and the spine 17 2 C h a p t e r T he central nervous system, with its complex sensory and motor functions, allows for an enormous amount of flexibility in a vertebrate’s survival activities. As these systems evolved over millions of years and became more crucial to the survival of our early ances- tors, they required the corresponding development of a protective structure that allows for free movement but is stable enough to offer protection to these vital yet delicate tissues. That structure, the skeletal spine, is perhaps nature’s most elegant and intricate solution to the dual demands of sthira and sukha. The human spine is unique among all mammals in that it exhibits both primary and secondary curves. The primary curve of the spine comprises the kyphotic thoracic and sacral curves; the secondary, lordotic curves are present in the cervical and lumbar regions (see figure 2.1). Only a true biped requires both pairs of curves; tree-swinging and knuckle-walking primates have some cervical curve, but no lumbar lordosis, which is why they can’t walk comfortably on two legs for long. The primary (kyphotic) curve was the first front–back1 spinal curve to emerge as aquatic creatures made the tran- sition to land",

It changes shape for the first time when the head negotiates the hairpin curve of the birth canal and the neck experiences its secondary (lordotic) curve for the very first time2 (see figure 2.3). As your postural development proceeds from the head downward, the cervical curve continues to develop after you learn to hold up the weight of your head at about three to four months and fully forms at around nine months, when you learn to sit upright (see figure 2.4). After crawling and creeping on the floor for months, you must acquire a lumbar curve to bring your weight over the feet. At 12 to 18 months, as you begin to walk, the lumbar spine straightens out from its primary, kyphotic curve. By 3 years of age, the lumbar spine starts to become concave forward (lordotic), although this won’t be outwardly visible until 6 to 8 years of age. It is only after the age of 10 that the lumbar curve fully assumes its adult shape. Figure 2.1 The curves of the spinal column. 1 The lateral undulations that propel fish, snakes, and lizards through their environments cease to be useful for a creature that supports its belly off the ground on four limbs. The successful early quadrupeds would have been those that arched their bellies away from the earth so that their weight-bearing and movement forces were distributed into the limbs and away from the vulnerable center of the spine. 2 This parallels the fact that the cervical spine was the site of the first development of a secondary curve as our quadrupedal ancestors found a survival benefit to lifting their heads and gazing from the ground immediately in front of them, out to the horizon.

As the only true biped mammals on the planet, humans are also earth’s least mechanically stable creatures. Fortunately, the disadvantage of having a bowling-ball-weighted cranium balancing on top of the whole system is offset by the advantage of having that big brain; it can figure out how to make the whole thing work efficiently—and that’s where yoga can help. The human form in general, and the spine in particular, exhibits an extraordinary resolu- tion between the contradictory requirements of rigidity and plasticity. As you will see in the next section, the structural balancing of the forces of sthira and sukha in your living body relates to a principle called intrinsic equilibrium—a deep source of support that can be uncovered through yoga practice.

    "content": "This fact about the core structures of the axial skeleton reveals a deeper truth about how yoga practice appears to liberate potential energy from the body. True to the principles of yoga and yoga therapy, the most profound changes occur when the forces obstructing that change are reduced. In the case of intrinsic equilibrium, a deep level of built-in support for the core of the body is involved. This built-in support does not depend on muscular effort because it is derived from the relationships between the non- contractile tissues of cartilage, ligament, and bone. Consequently, when this support asserts itself, it is always because some extraneous muscular effort has ceased to obstruct it. It takes a lot of energy to fuel our constant, unconscious muscular exertions against gravity, and that is why the release of that effort is associated with a feeling of liberated energy. Thus, it is tempting to refer to intrinsic equilibrium as a source of energy because its discovery is always accompanied by a profound sensation of increased vitality in the body. In short, yoga can help you to release the stored potential energy of the axial skeleton by identifying and releasing the less efficient extraneous muscular effort that can obstruct the expression of those deeper forces. Elements of Linkage Between the Vertebrae The spinal column as a whole is ideally constructed to neutralize the combination of com- pressive and tensile forces to which it is constantly subjected by gravity and movement. The 24 vertebrae are bound to each other with intervening zones of cartilaginous discs, capsular joints, and spinal ligaments (shown schematically in blue in figure 2.5). This alternation of bony and soft tissue structures represents a distinction between passive and active elements; the vertebrae are the passive, stable elements (sthira), and the active, moving elements (sukha) are the intervertebral discs, facet (capsular) joints, and a network of ligaments that connect the arches of adjacent vertebrae (figure 2.6)",

Figure 2.5 Alternating zones of hard and soft tissue in the spinal column. 20 Yoga Anatomy To understand the overall architecture of the spine, it is useful to view it as two separate columns. In the schematic side view in figure 2.7, its front-to-back dimension can be roughly divided in half between a column of vertebral bodies and a column of arches. Functionally, this arrangement very clearly evolved to contend with the dual requirements of stability and plasticity. The anterior column of vertebral bodies deals with weight-bearing, compressive forces, whereas the posterior column of arches deals with the tensile forces generated by movement. Within each column, in the dynamic relationship of bone to soft tissue, there is a balance of sthira and sukha. The vertebral bodies transmit compressive forces to the discs, which resist compression by pushing back. The column of arches transmits tension forces to all the attached ligaments (figure 2.8), which resist stretch- ing by pulling back. In short, the structural elements of the spinal column are involved in an intricate dance that protects the central nervous system by neutral- izing the forces of tension and compression. Figure 2.7 Viewed from the side, the spine divided into an anterior column of vertebral bodies and discs, and a posterior column of arches and processes. b a Figure 2.8 (a) Superior view of spinal ligaments, and (b) lateral view of spinal ligaments. Discs and Ligaments If you look deeper, you can also see how sthira and sukha are revealed in the components of an intervertebral disc: The tough, fibrous layers of the annulus fibrosis tightly enclose the soft, spherical nucleus pulposus. In a healthy disc, the nucleus is completely contained all around by the annulus and the vertebra (see figure 2.9)",

There are, however, common elements to all vertebral structure, as illustrated by the schematic representation in figure 2.11. Weight-bearing activities in general, as well as axial rotation (twisting movements), produce symmetrical (axial) compressive forces that flat- ten the nucleus into the annulus, which pushes back, resulting in a decompressive reaction (see figure 2.12). If the compressive force is high enough, rather than rupture, the nucleus will lose some of its moisture to the porous bone of the vertebral body. When the weight is taken off the spine, the hydrophilic nucleus draws the water back in, and the disc returns to its original thickness. That is why humans are a bit taller right after getting out of bed. Figure 2.10 The changing shape of the vertebrae.

Assisting in this counterpush are the long ligaments that run the entire length of the spine, front and back.

Note that all this activity occurs in tissues that behave independently of the circulatory, muscular, and voluntary nervous systems. In other words, their actions do not present an energy demand on these other systems. Types of Spinal Movement There are generally thought to be four possible movements of the spine: flexion, exten- sion, axial rotation (twisting), and lateral flexion (side bending). These four movements occur more or less spontaneously in the course of life: as you bend over to tie your shoes (flexion), reach for something on a high shelf (extension), grab a bag in the car seat behind you (axial rotation), or reach your arm into the sleeve of an overcoat (lateral flexion). There are, of course, yoga postures that emphasize these movements as well. A more thorough look into the nature of the four ranges of motion of the spine shows that there is a fifth possibility called axial extension. This motion doesn’t happen spontaneously in the normal course of daily movements. You have to learn how to make it happen inten- tionally because it is somewhat unnatural. Flexion and Extension, the Primary and Secondary Curves, and Inhalation and Exhalation The most basic movement of the spine is the one that emphasizes its primary curve: flexion. As discussed previously, the primary curve is the kyphotic curve present primarily in the thoracic spine, but it is also obvious in the shape of the sacrum. It’s no accident that the yoga pose that most completely exemplifies spinal flexion is called the child’s pose (see figure 2.14)—it replicates the primary curve of the unborn child. From a certain perspec- tive, all the curves of the body that are convex posteriorly can be seen as reflections of the primary curve",

Consequently, the secondary curves are present in all the body parts that are off the floor in this position: the cervical and lumbar spine, the backs of the knees, and the space posterior to the Achilles tendons. From this perspective, spinal flexion can be defined as an increase in the primary spinal curves and a decrease in the secondary spinal curves. A reversal of this definition would define spinal extension as an increase in the secondary curves and a decrease in the primary curves. Note that as far as movement is concerned, the relationship between the primary and secondary curves is reciprocal: The more you increase or decrease one, the more the other will want to do the opposite. For example, an increase in thoracic kyphosis automatically produces a decrease in cervical and lumbar lordosis. The classic yoga exercise that explores this reciprocal relationship of the primary and secondary curves is cat/cow, or chakravakasana (see figure 2.17). Figure 2.16 Savasana seen from below, showing spinal origins of the autonomic nervous system—sympathetic from the thoracic and parasympathetic from cervical and sacral regions. Figure 2.17 The cat/cow pose emphasizes both the primary and secondary curves. b a Cat Cow yoga and the spine 25 Supported at both ends by the arms and thighs, the spine’s curves can move freely in both directions, producing the shape changes of flexion and extension",

    "content": "Although it is common to teach this movement by telling the student to exhale on spinal flexion and inhale on extension, it is more accurate to say that spinal flexion is an exhalation and spinal extension is an inhalation. As the definition of breathing shows, spinal shape change is synonymous with breathing shape change (see figure 1.6 on page 6). M o v e m e n t E x p l o r at i o n From a comfortable sitting position, try increasing your thoracic kyphosis by drop- ping your chest forward. Notice how your neck and lower back flatten. Now, try the same movement, but initiate it with your head; if you drop your head forward, you’ll notice how the chest and lower spine will follow. The same will occur if you initiate this movement with your lower spine. You may also notice that these flexion move- ments of the spine generally tend to create an exhalation. Going in the opposite direction, try decreasing your thoracic kyphosis by lifting your chest. Notice how your neck and lower back increase their curves. If you try initiating it with your head or lower spine, the results will be the same. Did you notice how these extension movements of the spine tend to create an inhalation? Spatial and Spinal Perspectives in Forward- and Backward-Bending Poses Spinal extension is not necessarily the same thing as bending backward, and spinal flex- ion is not necessarily the same thing as bending forward. In order to avoid confusion, it’s important to keep these distinctions clear. Flexion and extension refer to the relationship of the spinal curves to each other, while forward bending and backward bending are terms that refer to movements of the body in space. The terms are not interchangeable. By way of illustration, picture the following contrasting examples of how two different body types would move into and out of a standing overhead reach: A stiff, sedentary office worker, whose stooped posture doesn’t change as his hips move forward and his arms reach overhead in an attempt to do a standing backbend",

    "content": "His spine is remaining in flexion while his body is moving backward in space. A flexible dancer, who hyperextends her spinal curves in the overhead reach, and keeps her spine extended as she flexes forward at the hip joints to move into uttanasana (standing forward bend). Her spine is remaining in extension while her body is bending forward in space. The valuable skill in observing movements like this is the ability to distinguish movement of the spinal curves in relation to each other from the movements of the torso in space. Figure 2.18 shows more of an integrated orientation to a standing backbend. Here, the secondary curves are kept under control, and the pelvis is kept firmly over the feet. As a result, there is much less movement backward in space, but a greater emphasis on thoracic extension (reduction of the primary curve). Although this is not a dramatic movement spatially, it will actu- ally provide a safe and effective stretch to the thoracic and rib structures and will be less disturbing to the process of breathing than either the dancer’s or the office worker’s movements. Spatial and Spinal Perspectives in Lateral and Twisting Movements When looking at yoga poses that involve lateral and twisting movements, it’s also important to distinguish spatial from spinal perspectives. Triangle (trikonasana) is a pose that is often referred to as a lateral stretch, and this is true insofar as it lengthens the connective tissue pathway that runs along the side of the body (see figure 2.19). 26 Yoga Anatomy It is, however, possible to lengthen the lateral line of the body without any appreciable lateral flexion of the spine, so again, we need to be clear what exactly is meant by a term like “lateral bend.” In trikonasana, more of a lateral line stretch would result from a wide spacing of the feet, and an intention to initiate the movement primarily from the pelvis while maintaining the spine in neutral extension. This also turns the pose into more of a hip-opener",

    "content": "This also turns the pose into more of a hip-opener. Lateral flexion of the spine could be emphasized by a closer spacing of the feet, which allows for more stabilization of the relationship between the pelvis and thighs, which would require the movement to come from the lateral bending of the spine. Sticking with the example of triangle pose, if we look at its revolved variation in figure 2.20, we can apply the same perspective to the twisting action of the spine. The lumbar spine is almost entirely incapable of axial rotation (only 5 degrees), which, in this pose, means that it will go wherever the sacrum leads it. Consequently, for the lower spine to twist in the direction of this pose, the pelvis would have to turn in the same direction. If the hips are restricted, the lumbar spine will appear to be moving in the opposite direction of the rib cage and shoulder girdle rotation, and when this is the case, most of the twist will originate from first joints above the sacrum that can freely rotate: the lower thoracics, T11-T12 and above. In addition, the twisting of the shoulder girdle around the rib cage can create the illusion that the spine is twisting more than it really is. So, the body can indeed be twisting in space, but a careful observation of the spine may tell where exactly the twisting is (or is not) coming from. If the pelvis is free to rotate around the hip joints, this pose will exhibit a more evenly distributed twist throughout the spine (rather than an overloading of T11 and T12). The Figure 2.18 An integrated orientation to a standing backbend.

    "content": "In other words, the cervi- cal, thoracic, and lumbar curves are all reduced, and the result is that the overall length of the spine is increased. Figure 2.21 Axial extension involves a simultaneous reduction of the primary and secondary curves, which lengthens the spinal column beyond its neutral alignment. Figure 2.20 Parivrtta trikonasana. 28 Yoga Anatomy Because the primary and secondary curves have a reciprocal relationship, which is expressed in the “natural” movements of flexion and extension, axial extension is “unnatu- ral” in the sense that it bypasses this reciprocal relationship by reducing all three curves at once. In other words, axial extension doesn’t happen all on its own; it requires conscious effort and training to accomplish. The action that produces axial extension involves a shift in the tone and orientation of the breathing structures known as the bandhas. The three diaphragms (pelvic, respiratory, and vocal) and their surrounding musculature become more sthira (stable). As a result, the ability of the thoracic and abdominal cavities to change shape is more limited in axial exten- sion. The overall effect is a reduction of breath volume but an increase in length. The overall yogic term that describes this state of the spine and breath is mahamudra, which always involves axial extension and the bandhas. It is possible to do mahamudra from many positions, including seated, standing, supine, and in arm supports. A seated posture named mahamudra (see figure 2.22) adds a twisting action to axial extension. It is considered a supreme accomplishment to do this practice with all three band- has executed correctly, because it represents a complete merging of asana and pranayama practice. Figure 2.22 Mahamudra combines axial extension and a twisting action. 29 understanding the asanas 29 3 C h a p t e r D eciding which anatomical details of yoga poses to depict is quite a challenge",

    "content": "Unlike weight training and stretching, which focus on specific muscles, yoga focuses on asanas that are whole-body practices; no elements are entirely passive.1 Respecting the principles of yoga previously discussed, I have attempted a reconciliation of opposing imperatives in selecting the following information. I have tried to be system- atic, but not formulaic, taking each posture on its own unique terms, while providing some consistency in the format of the page spreads and the information provided. Because yoga practice is fundamentally experiential, the information in this book is intended to be an inspiration to explore your own body. Perhaps you will understand more clearly something you’ve experienced as a result of reviewing this material. On the other hand, some anatomical detail may capture your interest and move you to investigate it through a pose that’s being depicted. In either case, this book will have served its purpose if it supports you in these explorations. Starting Positions and the Base of Support The poses in this book are arranged by their starting position. Every unusual position of the body has to begin with a usual position. The five “usual positions” are commonly referred to as the starting positions. Any asana you can think of has one of these common positions as its starting point: Standing—supported on the soles of your feet (page 33) Sitting—supported on the base of your pelvis (page 79) Kneeling—supported on your knees, shins, and tops of feet (page 119) Supine—supported on the back surface of your body (page 135) Prone—supported on the front surface of your body (page 163) Within each asana section is at least one forward bend, backbend, twist, lateral bend, and axial extension. The selections include the postures that are most commonly practiced by the majority of teaching traditions. Related to the issue of starting position is the concept of the base of support",

    "content": "Related to the issue of starting position is the concept of the base of support. This refers to the parts of the body that are on the ground and through which the weight-bearing forces are transmitted down to the earth, resulting in some supporting energy generated upward into the body. Anatomically, only the feet—supporting the legs and pelvis—have evolved specifically to accomplish this. That is perhaps why the simple standing poses are considered the starting point for all asana practice by most yoga traditions. The lessons you learn from standing on the earth can be applied to any other base of support you may experience. The structures in the body that most closely resemble the feet and legs are, of course, the hands and arms. When you employ them to create a base of support, you do arm supports, which are covered in a chapter all their own on page 175. 1 Even savasana (the corpse pose), requiring complete relaxation of all the skeletal muscles, has an active component: The mind is intentionally focused on the process of breathing and relaxation—otherwise it’s just napping. 30 Yoga Anatomy Information for Each Pose With occasional variation, each pose description includes the following sections: • Name. Each asana is presented with its Sanskrit name and its translated English name. Additionally, some descriptive text is added to clarify the meaning or context of the pose’s name. • Classification and level. Poses are classified by their base of support, spinal action, and level of difficulty. • Key structures. For each asana, at least three key structures are highlighted. These may be anatomical elements that the pose brings into greater focus or function. They could also be less obvious body parts that can provide a deeper action than you would ordinarily notice. Additionally, a particular asana description might discuss an interesting anatomical observation that could just as easily apply to several other postures. • Key joint and limb actions",

    "content": "• Key joint and limb actions. The joints and limbs that are involved in the asana are identified according to their actions: flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation, and so forth. • Working and lengthening. In the performance of any yoga asana, the most prominent sensations are generated by the lengthening and working of the skeletal muscles. Many times, muscles have to work and lengthen simultaneously to do the poses. For each pose, some element of that component is depicted and analyzed. The key muscles for each pose are discussed. • Breathing. Breathing is the changing of shape of the body cavities. Each yoga posture presents a specific shape-changing challenge to the respiratory mechanism. Many postures are presented with notes on these underlying breathing patterns and suggestions on how to use the breath to get the most out of the posture’s effects. • Obstacles and notes. From a certain perspective, yoga is the practice of uncovering and resolving obstructions in the human system. Practicing yoga asanas is a systematic way of encountering those obstacles in the most perceptually accessible aspect of our system—the physical body. Presented are the most common obstacles to achieving each of the pictured asanas, along with some useful suggestions for overcoming them. • Cautions. Certain poses present potential risk to specific body parts or to particular people. These are pointed out where applicable. • Variations. For certain asanas, key variations are pictured and explained. • Special notes. Here, wherever it’s needed, are notes that don’t fit into any of the other categories. This could include comments about the asana’s terminology, history, mythology, or any other contextual information. Types of Muscle Contractions In the “Working and Lengthening” sections in the next chapters, four types of muscle contractions are referred to: Concentric—The length of the muscle decreases during a contraction. Eccentric—The length of the muscle increases during a contraction",

Isometric—The length of the muscle remains constant during a contraction against resistance, and the intention is to not move. Isotonic—The length of the muscle remains constant during a contraction against resistance, and the intention is to move. understanding the asanas 31 An understandable question that could arise is: “Since the poses are all static, why wouldn’t all the muscles just be doing isometric contractions?”2 The short answer to this question is that the text is describing how to come into a pose from a starting position, rather than how to be in a pose. In other words, look at an asanas as a process rather than as a final product. Most often an image of an asana depicts the end point of a movement. Even if you stay in a pose for a period of time, the muscle actions that got you there from the starting point (standing, sitting, kneeling, and so on) are still present. In addition, the movements of the breathing structures never cease. In yoga poses, we experience a cross section of a never- ending progression of movement and breath, extending infinitely forward and backward in time.3 As long as we are in this matrix of space and time, we will never actually be still, and our full action potential will be present and accessible. The Drawings The asana images in this book are based on photographs of various models that were taken during several sessions. Some of the perspectives are quite unusual, because they were shot from below using a large sheet of plexiglass, or from above using a ladder. The photos were used as reference for the anatomical illustrator, who posed her skeleton in the various positions and sketched the bones by hand.

For reference to “isometric” versus “stabilizing isotonic,” see Adler, Beckers, and Buck, 2003. 3 A memorable description of this concept is contained in Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, in which he describes the Tralfamadorians, who live in the fourth dimension. When they look at a person, they see a very long, four-dimensional caterpillar, with tiny newborn legs at one end and withered, elderly legs at the other end. Human beings, lacking the fourth dimension of perception, can only see a three-dimensional cross section of the caterpillar. Yoga Anatomy photo shoot at The Breathing Project in New York City.

The architecture of the feet, along with their musculature, shows nature’s unmatched ability to reconcile and neutralize opposing forces. Clearly, however, these amazing structures are massively overengineered for the way most people use them in the civilized world of stiff shoes and paved surfaces. Fortunately, yoga exercises are done barefoot, with much attention given to restoring the strength and flexibility of the foot and lower leg muscles. In yoga practice, some of the earliest lessons frequently center on the simple act of stand- ing upright—something you’ve been doing (more or less successfully) since you were about a year old",

Standing positions have the highest center of gravity of all the starting points, and the effort of stabilizing that center makes standing poses—by definition—brahmana. Release and support, giving and receiving, inhaling and exhaling—Patanjali’s formulation of sthiram sukham asanam encompasses all of these and more.1 The fundamental lessons you learn from standing postures can illuminate the practice of all the other asanas. 1 Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra, II.1. T.K.V. Desikachar’s translation sums it up well when he defines sthiram as “alertness without tension” and sukham as “relaxation without dullness.” 34 Tadasana Mountain Pose tah-DAHS-anna tada = mountain This pose’s name evokes many images that relate to a stable, rooted base of sup- port and a “crown” that reaches for the heavens. 35 Classification and Level Easy standing pose Key Structures Intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles, quadriceps, iliopsoas, piriformis, abdomi- nal wall, diaphragm.

The knee joints are extended (but not hyperextended); the elbow joints are extended and the forearms are pronated. The arches of the feet are lifted and connecting with the upward lifting action in the pelvic floor, the lower abdomen, rib cage, cervical spine, and the top of the head.

Interestingly, this pose is almost identical to the “anatomical position”—the start- ing reference point for the study of movement and anatomy. The only major dif- ference between the two positions is that in tadasana, the palms of the hands are facing the sides of the thighs rather than forward. Nonmuscular support and padding for the foot: the fat pads (yellow) and plantar fascia (blue). The muscles of the foot occupy the space between the plantar fascia and the bones. (continued) 36 This body position is also uniquely human, because humans are the only true biped mammals on the planet. Humans are also the least stable of creatures, pos- sessing the smallest base of support, the highest center of gravity, and (propor- tionately) the heaviest brain balancing atop it all. The base of support of this pose—the feet—offers a beautiful image of how the passive and active forces of release and support operate in the human system. The essential structure of the foot can be represented by a triangle. The three points of the triangle are the three places where the foot’s structure will rest on a supporting surface: the calcaneal tuberosity, the base of the first metatarsal, and the base of the fifth metatarsal. The lines connecting these points represent the arches—three lines of lift through which postural support is derived: the medial longitudinal arch, the lateral longitudinal arch, and the transverse (metatarsal) arch. From underneath, the two triangles of the feet can be joined to show the size and shape of the base of support for tadasana. The “plumb line” that passes through the body’s center of gravity in this position should also fall through the exact center of this base. Triangles represent the three points of support of each foot. The three arches of the foot",

The four layers of musculature (see top figure on page 37) all combine to create lift, balance, and movement of the 28 bones of the foot, which has evolved to be an incredibly adaptable structure able to move you smoothly through space over uneven terrain. The foot has evolved over millions of years in a world with no roads or side- walks. In today’s world in which many uneven surfaces have been leveled and paved, it’s clearly overengineered. When the adaptability of the foot is no longer needed for locomotion, the deeper muscles that support the arches inevitably weaken, eventually leaving only the superficial, noncontractile plantar fascia responsible for preventing the total collapse of the foot. This frequently leads to plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The practice of standing postures in general, and tadasana in particular, is one of the best ways to restore the natural aliveness, strength, and adaptability of the feet.

All the standing poses that are executed from this base, as opposed to tadasana, consequently have a wider, more stable base of support. This is typically done in the vinyasa styles, in which breath-coordinated movement is the focus, rather than the alignment- oriented approaches, in which static maintenance of positions is preferred. Additionally, the head is lowered and the hands are in namaste (prayer) position.

Terminology Note In the Ashtanga tradition of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, the term samasthiti refers to what is here described as tadasana. In the teaching tradition of Sri T. Krishnam- acharya and his son, T.K.V. Desikachar, the term tadasana refers to a standing pose with the arms overhead, and balancing on the balls of the feet.

Beginning students in this asana tend to feel a lot heavier than their weight because of this. 42 Uttanasana Standing Forward Bend OOT-tan-AHS-anna ut = intense tan = stretch Gastrocnemius Spinal extensors Hamstrings Piriformis Classification and Level Easy standing pose, forward bend Key Structures Hip joint, legs, spine. Joint Actions Hip flexion, knee extension, mild spinal flexion (the tighter the hamstrings, the more the spinal flexion). Working Upper body: Gravity. Lower body: Vastus medialis, intermedius, lateralis (knee extensors); articularis genus (to draw up on the capsule of the knee joint); feet and ankles (for balance). Lengthening Spinal muscles, hamstrings, posterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus, gluteus maximus, pirifor- mis, adductor magnus, soleus, gastrocnemius. Breathing Deep hip flexion compresses the abdomen. This combined with gravity moves the center of the diaphragm cranially, so more freedom is needed in the back of the rib cage for the movement of the breath. 43 Obstacles Tightness in hamstrings, spinal muscles, gluteals. Cautions People with back injury, osteoporosis, or both should approach deep forward bending very cautiously and gradually. People with high blood pressure (hypertension) should go into this pose gradually and remain in it only if their breathing is not strained. People with low blood pressure (hypotension) should come out of this pose very slowly, because they may become dizzy. Notes In this pose, gravity should do the work. People experiencing tightness in the back of the legs sometimes pull themselves down, which cre- ates tightness and congestion in the rectus femoris and psoas. It’s better to soften the knees to find some space in the hip joint, allow- ing the spine to release. Only then does lengthening the legs produce an even stretch along the entire back line of the body",

Obstacles Tightness in the hamstrings or gluteus maximus in the lifted leg can cause spinal flexion, and thus hip extension or knee flexion in the standing leg. It’s better to bend the knee in the lifted leg and find neutral curves in the spine and neutral extension in the standing hip, and knee extension (but not hyperextension) in the standing leg. Notes Weakness in standing leg abductors can create “hip hike” on the side of the lifted leg, leading to overwork of the quadratus lumborum. Weakness in the hip flexors (psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris) can also cause overwork in the quadratus lumborum and hip hike. Breathing In maintaining this balance pose, the stabilizing action in the abdominal muscles combines with the bracing action of the arms to create an overall reduction of breathing capacity. If there is excessive muscular tension, the reduced volume of breath will not be sufficient to fuel the effort, and the increased volume of breath will tend to compromise the balance. 46 Classification and Level Basic asymmetrical standing balance Key Structures Lower leg, foot, arch, abductors, and external rotators of the standing leg; external and internal obliques, to stabilize torso to pelvis.

Lengthening Lifted leg: Pectineus, adductor longus and brevis, gracilis. Standing leg: Gluteus medius and minimus, piriformis (working eccentrically). Notes The adductors lengthen to get into position; they may have some role in holding the leg in place by pressing the foot into the inside of the standing leg. Misusing the pectineus to hold the leg in place creates flexion at the hip, tilting the pelvis and rotating the leg inward. Abductors on the standing leg are working eccentrically; if they are weak or tight, the hip of the lifted leg will “hike up,” or the rotators will try to stabilize the pelvis and the pelvis will rotate open. The more strength and adaptability you have in the feet and ankles, the more options you will have for finding balance. Breathing Compared to tree pose with arms elevated (next variation) or utthita hasta padangusthasana (the toe-hold posture), the upper body is freer to participate in respiratory movements in this pose. With the arms held quietly in namaste, and the raised leg braced against the adductors of the standing leg, the attention and center of gravity are drawn inward and downward.

Obstacles and Notes Overuse of the latissimus dorsi to “pull shoulders down the back” interferes with the elevation of the scapulae; it can create impingement at the acromion of the biceps tendon and supraspinatus. The rib cage can also be pushed forward from a restriction of the latissimus. This variation creates a higher center of gravity by placing the arms overhead, and is therefore categorized as an intermediate-level balancing asana. Breathing Because of the stabilizing action of the muscles that keep the arms overhead, the thoracic movements of the breath encounter more resistance in this position. In addition, the higher center of gravity will tend to produce a stronger stabilizing action in the abdominal muscles. Taken together, these factors combine to reduce the overall excursion of the diaphragm; therefore, quiet, efficient breathing is the most appropriate pattern.

Both the standing and the lifted leg need to internally rotate and adduct in this position. To achieve the full entwining, the standing leg needs to flex at the hip and knee. This position of hip flexion with internal rotation and adduction is not structurally easy (the fibers of the hip joint capsule make it easier to internally rotate when the hip is in extension)",

Breathing This is the most “compacted” of the one-legged balancing postures, from the standpoint of both the shape and center of gravity, and the breathing.

    "content": "The psoas minor, rectus abdominis, and obliques should all work eccentrically against the action of the spinal extensors to prevent too much action in the lumbar spine, and move more action into thoracic spinal extension and hip extension. Standing leg: The gluteus medius and minimus and the tensor fascia latae work eccentrically to keep the pelvis level. The quadriceps extend the knee, and the hamstrings lengthen (if there’s enough range of motion in the hamstrings, they might work eccentrically to resist tipping too far for- ward). The muscles of the feet and forelegs are active for balance. Lifted leg: The hamstrings create hip extension and knee flexion, and the vastii come into isometric or concentric action as knee extensors as the pose deepens, to increase the hip extension against the resistance of the hand on the foot. The adductor magnus is active as both an adductor and hip extensor, and the gluteus maximus (though not as an external rotator). Lengthening Arms: Rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, triceps, pectoralis major. Spine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, intercostals. Standing leg: Hamstrings, abductors (working eccentrically).

Obstacles and Notes Scapula mobility is important in this “full-arm” version—both for getting the arm into position without overmobilizing the glenohumeral joint and for mobility in the thoracic spine. Find the deeper, more intrinsic back muscles to do the action of spinal exten- sion. Using the latissimus and other superficial back muscles will interfere with breathing and with the ability to find the full range of motion in the scapulae. It is also a challenge to keep the legs adducted and internally rotated in this action. Although many people seek more extension through external rotation, this involves the risk of overmobilizing the sacroiliac joint or overworking the lumbar spine. As in dhanurasana, the binding of the hands and feet can put pressure into vulnerable spots such as the knees and lower back",

    "content": "Breathing The excursion of the diaphragm is greatly minimized in dancer’s pose by the combi- nation of deep spinal extension and the anterior and posterior musculature working against each other to stabilize this shape in gravity. Consequently, this pose should be held with quiet breathing, and seldom for a very long time, because the mus- cular effort required to maintain it soon outpaces the body’s ability to supply those muscles with oxygen. The longer the pose is held, the deeper the body will need to breathe, and the more the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm will release their stabilizing actions, leading to an increased risk to the spine and shoulders. 54 Virabhadrasana I Warrior I veer-ah-bah-DRAHS-anna virabhadra = the name of a fierce mythical warrior Classification and Level Basic asymmetrical standing backbend Key Structures Articulate pelvis, integrity of spine, action in legs (rotation to balance the pelvis).

Balance Issues Severe sacroiliac instability, although this pose is used to improve sac- roiliac problems that may arise from too much prolonged seated practice. Notes The shorter (from front to back) and wider (from side to side) stance of this basic warrior pose employs an easier action in the pelvis and a higher center of gravity, but it is generally an easier pose to balance in because of the wider base of support and the increased free- dom of the hip joints. 56 Breathing In all the warrior poses, positioning and maintaining the pelvis’ relationship to the legs and torso requires strong action in the abdominal wall, which reduces the downward excursion of the central tendon of the diaphragm. As a result, the contraction of the diaphragm will have more of a tendency to create a brah- mana effect by lifting upward the base of the rib cage—an action that will only occur efficiently if there is not undue tension in the intercostals, chest, and neck muscles. In short, the challenging leg, pelvis, and arm positions of the warrior poses combine to create interesting challenges to the breath mechanics.

Breathing This variation of the warrior is used mostly when the pose is done statically, with no vinyasa (dynamic movement into and out of an asana).

The work of the abductors (gluteus medius and minimus) is important; they help to lift the back knee away from the floor. If the gluteus medius and minimus are weak or tight, other muscles will be recruited, but they will also bring in external rotation or flexion at the hip, which will show up as an inability to “ground” the back foot. Back ankle joint: Articulation is needed in the subtalar joint and the joints between the tarsals and metatarsals: The back part of the foot supinates so the calcaneus can clearly connect to the floor, and the forefoot pronates so the toes can clearly connect to the floor. If the foot doesn’t articulate in this way, the outer ankle can be overstretched and weakened",

Notes The spine is in axial extension; the work is to maintain the spinal curves in this relationship to gravity, balancing the abdominal action with the back extensors. If abdominal support is lacking, the extensors will overwork, and the spine will arch excessively. Gravity draws the unsupported side of the pelvis toward the floor. Generally you don’t need to use the adductors to do this; instead, the ability of the abduc- tors and external rotators to lengthen with control is essential (otherwise the pelvis is lifted away from floor). If hamstrings are tight, bending the standing leg is better than rotating the pelvis. Breathing The bandhas (see page 16) create the axial extension that supports the torso in this pose, and by definition, that reduces the overall volume of the breath.

In the back leg, the action is similar to virabhadrasana II: primarily gluteus medius and minimus (the anterior fibers help with internal rotation, the posterior fibers with abduction); gluteus maximus, for extension (but not external rota- tion); tensor fascia lata, for internal rotation (but not flexion); pectineus for internal rotation (but not flexion); hamstrings (more semimembranosus); quadriceps to extend the knee (more vastii than rectus femoris). Notes In the front leg, the increased hip flexion makes it more challenging to maintain abduction and external rotation in the leg, which keeps the knee from falling inward or the hip from swinging out. The increased hip flexion does make it possible for the lower side of the body to stay long and for the spine to maintain its neutral length. If there is not enough hip flexion, the spine will flex laterally. The upper arm, spine, and back leg form one continuous diagonal line. It can be a challenge to keep the spine in line with the leg in this position and not to flex in the back hip joint. Breathing Even though the upper side of the breathing mechanism receives a strong stretch in this shape, the more interesting effect may be on the lower side of the body, where the dome of the diaphragm is driven cranially by the force of grav- ity acting on the abdominal organs. Breath action in this position provides very useful asymmetrical stimulation to the diaphragm and all the organs attaching to it",

Splenius capitis Rhomboids Hamstrings Quadriceps Erector spinae (under latissimus) Latissimus dorsi 65 The spinal rotation works the erector spinae and internal obliques on the side of the torso closer to the ceiling and the transversospinalis and rotatores and exter- nal obliques on the side of the torso closer to the front leg. All spinal extensors are active to counter the spinal flexion created by the action of the arms. The arm binding works the supraspinatus to hold the head of the humerus in the socket, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and rhomboids, while lengthening the upper trapezius, pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus ante- rior, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, anterior deltoid, and coracobra- chialis. This arm binding also tends to create spinal flexion, combined with rotation, which is very challenging to the joints and discs in the spine. The force created by revolved side angle makes this a very powerful twist; it is possible to use the leverage of the arms in their binding and against the leg to force the spine past an appropriate range of motion. Because the lumbar spine is mostly incapable of axial rotation, overtwisting will stress the joints above and below: the sacroiliacs and T11-T12. Obstacles and Notes The anterior inferior part of the glenohumeral joint capsule is the most vulnerable to dislocation",

    "content": "Piriformis 67 Obstacles and Notes Pain or sensation in the medial knee of the front leg can be from the gracilis and semitendinosus, which are especially lengthened in this position and can transfer strain to the joint capsule. It is important to keep the back of the front leg active (hamstrings) to avoid knee hyperextension, which is easy to do with the weight of the body over the leg. Sensations from within the knee (or any joint) are important signals to stop what you’re doing and adjust your action or position. Pain in the lateral knee of the back leg can be from tightness in the muscles at the top of the iliotibial band (tensor fascia lata, gluteus medius, gluteus maxi- mus); they need to both lengthen and engage. If the gluteus medius and maxi- mus are tight and the leg can’t adduct relative to the pelvis, the spine will flex laterally. Tightness at the top of the iliotibial band can also contribute to tightness in the back of the ankle. Does the spine rotate? The more articulate the sacroiliac joints, pelvic halves, and hip joints are, the more purely the spine can stay neutral. For example, if the front leg has a tight pectineus, the pelvis may rotate to the floor, and the spine will have to counterrotate more to open the chest. Restrictions in any of the other lower-body structures that need to articulate will produce similar compen- satory changes farther up in the system. Variation Utthita Trikonasana oo-TEE-tah trik-cone-AHS-anna Extended Triangle Pose utthita = extended The extended version of triangle produces more acute angles between the legs and torso and the floor. All the same muscular actions apply, but at a greater range of motion. Even though extended triangle has a lower center of gravity, it is less stable than regular tri- angle, because the more extended this base of support becomes, the less able the supporting muscles will be to counter the downward pull of gravity on the pelvis and torso",

If legs are medially rotated, may get some stretch through quadratus femoris, obturator externus. As the legs separate (abduct), different hamstrings are affected more or less strongly as well as different adductors. Because some of the adductors also act as hip flexors, they aren’t stretched in this position. The standing preparation for this pose (standing upright with the hips in neutral extension) would be more of a stretch for the pectineus and some fibers of the adductor brevis and gracilis. Breathing Wide-stance forward bend is probably the safest, most accessible inversion in all of yoga practice. The more firmly the legs can create support, while at the same time allowing the pelvis to freely rotate forward at the hip joints, the more relaxed the torso and breathing will be. This inversion provides mild traction and release to the spine, while reversing the usual action of the breath.

Obstacles and Notes The inability to dorsiflex the ankle deeply enough to keep the heels on the floor can be due to shortness in the Achilles tendon (specifically the soleus, in this position); however, restriction can also be in the front of the ankle. A quick fix is available by using support under the heels, but it’s important not to become too reliant on it, because it will prevent activation of the intrinsic muscles of the feet, which stabilizes the arches, allows deeper flexion in the ankle, and aligns the bones of the foot and knee joint. Look for the tendon of the anterior tibialis pop- ping forward; this is a telltale sign that deep support is lacking. Let gravity create the flexion, and use the intrinsic muscles to maintain integrity. Breathing This pose offers an opportunity to powerfully lengthen all three curves of the spine (axial extension). By definition this usually engages all three bandhas, and in this position, the deep support in the arches of the feet energetically feeds into the lifting action of the pelvic floor and lower abdominal muscles (mula bandha). The bracing of the elbows against the knees allows for a strong lengthening of the thoracic spine and lifting of the base of the rib cage and respiratory dia- phragm (uddiyana bandha). The chin-lock of jalandhara bandha completes the action of axial extension and essentially freezes out the normal respiratory shape changes of breathing. This is when the unusual pattern of breath associated with mahamudra can arise deep in the core of the system (susumna). 79 sitting poses 79 5 C h a p t e r F or many people in the industrialized world, sitting (or more likely, slouching) on a piece of furniture is the body position in which they spend most of their waking hours.

    "content": "What shoes are to the feet, chairs, car seats, and couches are to the pelvic joints and lower spine. In India, even well-to-do families frequently eschew the use of furniture in their homes— preferring to sit, dine, and sometimes even sleep on the floor. Not surprisingly, the Western epidemic of lower-back pain is almost unknown in that part of the world. In yoga practice, just as the bare feet develop a new relationship with the ground through the practice of standing asanas, the hip, pelvic joints, and lower spine develop a new rela- tionship with the earth when you bear weight directly on them in sitting postures. The asanas depicted in this chapter are either sitting positions themselves or are entered into from sitting. If practiced with attention to the anatomy of the relevant joints, muscles, and connective tissue, they can help to restore some of the natural flexibility you knew as a child, when sitting and playing on the floor for hours at a time was effortless. Beyond the idea of restoring natural function to the pelvis and lower back, yogic sitting also has an association with more advanced practices. The word asana in fact can be literally translated as “seat,” and from a certain perspective, all of asana practice can be viewed as a methodical way of freeing up the spine, limbs, and breathing so that the yogi can spend extended periods of time in a seated position. In this most stable of body shapes, the dis- tractions of dealing with gravity and breath can disappear, freeing the body’s energies for the deeper contemplative work of meditative practices.

Common joint actions Knees flexed Hip joints flexed Spine in neutral curves or axial extension Skull balanced on spine Common elements to all sitting Whatever sitting position one chooses, if the knees are above the hip joints, the pelvis can tip posteriorly, causing the spinal curves to go into flexion, especially if there is tightness in sitting poses 81 the hamstrings. To maintain an upright shape, the erector muscles contract to extend the spine, and the psoas muscles contract to pull the anterior lumbar spine forward (attempt- ing to restore the lumbar curve). Unfortunately, this psoas action tends to also pull the hips into greater flexion, reinforcing the posterior tilt of the pelvis, which calls a host of other muscles into play in attempt to compensate. A person engaged in such a losing battle with gravity will have little energy available for breathing or meditation practices, and will soon tire of sitting. In order for a seated asana to be maintained in a comfortable manner for any length of time, for most people, the hip joints need to be at least slightly elevated above the knees. For the vast majority of people, this requires the use of a cushion, folded blanket, or other aid.1 With the hips elevated above the knees, the lumbar and other spinal curves are restored, and the weight of the head can balance with minimal muscular effort",

Obstacles and Notes If there is a lot of tightness in the hamstrings and gluteus maximus, hip flexion will be restricted and the hip flexors (psoas major, iliacus, pectineus, and rectus femoris) and abdominal muscles will tend to contract to pull the body forward into this pose. Instead, a folded blanket under the sitting bones can elevate the seat so that gravity is drawing the upper body forward more effectively. This is preferable to using the hip flexors and abdominal muscles, which can create a sense of congestion in the hip joints. Elevating the seat, bending the knees, or both, can allow the spine to come more forward. There will still be lengthening in the hamstrings, but in a less stressful way. It should be noted that any stretching sensations around the origin or insertion of a muscle indicate that the tendons and connective tissue are being stretched— as opposed to the muscle fibers. Alignment and intention should always be adapted to direct stretching sensations into the belly of the target muscle—not its attachments. Breathing The breath can be very helpful while moving into this pose. Emphasizing the action of the exhalation deepens the flexion at the pelvis, whereas emphasizing the action of the inhalation assists in extending the upper spine. This will only occur if the exhalation is initiated with the lower abdominal muscles and the inhalation is directed toward the rib cage.

Extended leg: Gravity acts to flex the hip; the vastii and articularis genus extend the knees (if necessary). Folded leg: Gravity acts to nutate the sacrum and flex the hip. The obtura- tor externus, quadratus femoris, piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli externally rotate the hip; the sartorius externally rotates and flexes the hip and knee. The hamstrings act to flex the knee, and the tibialis anterior flexes the ankle and supinates the foot. Hamstrings Soleus Gastrocnemius Janu sirsasana from underneath. (continued) 86 Lengthening Spine: The spinal extensors lengthen if releasing into the pose. The latis- simus dorsi lengthen bilaterally. Extended-leg-side external obliques and folded-leg-side internal obliques, extended-leg-side rotatores, and multifidi lengthen with the rotation toward the straight leg (these are the reverse of the working actions mentioned earlier). Extended leg: Hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus and gemelli, some gluteus medius and minimus, gastrocnemius, and soleus. The popliteus can create slight knee flexion to prevent hyperextension",

Folded leg: The adductor magnus mainly stretches because it creates internal rotation, extension, and adduction (as in baddha konasana). The adduc- tor longus and brevis also stretch because they flex and externally rotate the leg (abduction lengthens these two). The more the legs are externally rotated and abducted, the more the pectineus is lengthened. There also might be some lengthening in the tensor fascia lata, because of the exter- nal rotation, and in the fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus with increasing hip flexion. Arms: The rhomboids lengthen, as do the lower trapezius and latissimus dorsi. Obstacles and Notes The asymmetry of this pose makes it very revealing about the “sidedness” exhib- ited in the back muscles. Janu sirsasana can also reveal sidedness in the relative stability or mobility of the sacroiliac joints. Everyone has an “easy” and a “hard” side in this pose because of the inherent asymmetries of the human body. The more mobile the sacroiliac joint is on the side of the flexed leg, the easier it is to turn and face the extended leg. This is especially true as the spine extends toward the extended leg. As hip flexion deepens, less spinal flexion is required. Because this limits even further the rotation in the lumbar spine, more movement needs to happen at the sacroiliac joint. It is very common to overmobilize the sacroiliac joint in janu sirsasana. This happens when the pose is pushed or flexed too forcibly or held for too long without relieving the weight on the pelvis. Alternatively, immobility of the pelvic joints can lead to excessive torque in the bent-leg knee joint. Many yogis report meniscus tears occurring as they move into this pose. This happens in a partially flexed knee as the pelvis flexes forward, taking the femur with it, which grinds the medial femoral condyle into the medial meniscus. Ensuring that the bent leg is truly fully flexed will move the meniscus safely to the back of the joint",

Janu Sirsasana (continued) 87 Breathing The breath can be very helpful while moving into this pose. Emphasizing the action of the exhalation deepens the flexion at the pelvis, whereas emphasizing the action of the inhalation assists in extending the upper spine. This will only occur if the exhalation is initiated with the lower abdominal muscles and the inhalation is directed toward the rib cage. It’s interesting to experiment with the opposite pattern of breath, just to create a contrast: Try exhaling by compressing the chest and inhaling into the belly region.

Obstacles and Notes Although the legs in this pose are the same as in janu sirsasana, the action in the spine is very different: Instead of rotating toward the extended leg, the rotation is away from the leg, and instead of flexion in the spine there is lateral flexion. This change in spinal action changes the action in the shoulder girdle and arms as well—notably, more lengthening occurs in the latissimus dorsi. Side-bending poses are great for releasing restrictions in the shoulder joints. When flexion of the glenohumeral joint is restricted, greater mobility can often be found by mobilizing the scapula in lateral flexion. In this pose, the opposite sitting bone must stay on the ground to keep the pose’s action balanced",

When side bending over the extended leg, the hip of the folded leg can come off the floor, which diminishes the lengthening in the back of the body, but increases the lengthening in the back of the extended leg. Breathing The upper side of this pose is receiving more stretch, and the rib cage is more open, but the lower dome of the diaphragm is more mobile, and the lower lung’s tissue is more compliant. Focusing on this fact can quite naturally create a bit more awareness of the lower side, which helps prevent compressive collapse. 90 Upavistha Konasana Seated Wide-Angle Pose oo-pah-VEESH-tah cone-AHS-anna upavistha = seated kona = angle Classification and Level Intermediate seated forward bend Joint Actions Mild spinal flexion (moving toward axial extension); sacrum nutation; major hip abduction, external rotation, and flexion; knee extension; ankle dorsi- flexion.

Of the adductors, the gracilis is especially stretched because of the knee extension; the pectineus is not affected because of the hip flexion. In the hamstrings, the semi- tendinosus and semimem- branosus are particularly lengthened here because of the abduction of the legs. When the hands reach to the foot to assist the ankle into dorsiflexion, the gastrocnemius receives a strong stretch. Spine: Extensors of the spine are lengthening, but active. As the pose deepens, it moves toward more axial extension. Obstacles and Notes There is a strong action of nutation at the sacroiliac joint, as the top of the sacrum “nods” forward, while leaving the iliac bones behind. If the legs roll inward, there can be too much stretch for the inner knee and adductors. For tight students, it’s preferable to bend the knees a bit (with sup- port) so that the stretching sensations are felt more in the bellies of the relevant muscles. Sensations of stretch occurring near the joints and muscle attachments are indicators that nothing useful is likely to result from the stretch. Breathing The act of gradually lengthening the spine in this pose can be greatly assisted by the breath. The exhalation, if initiated in the lower abdomen, can help anchor the sitting bones and ground the backs of the thighs, whereas the inhalation, if it’s initiated in the upper chest, can help to lengthen the spine. In short, the exhalation can ground the posture’s lower half, and the inhalation can lengthen the posture’s upper half",

Working Spine: Intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, transversospinalis group, erec- tor spinae group to maintain neutral extension of spine, then gravity to bring the spine forward and into mild flexion. Legs: Gravity nutates the sacrum and flexes the hips; the obturator externus, quadratus femoris, piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli act to exter- nally rotate the hip joint; the hamstrings work to flex the knees; the tibialis anterior supinates the foot. The sartorius should be considered active as well, to flex and externally rotate the hip joint. Arms: A balance between the serratus anterior and rhomboids is needed to hold the scapulae on the rib cage. The biceps flex the elbows and draw the body forward, as the flexors of the carpals and fingers work to grasp the feet. Lengthening Legs: A major stretch is given to the adductor magnus mainly because it cre- ates internal rotation, extension, and adduction, opposite to the actions of baddha konasana. There is also some stretch to the adductor longus and brevis, and gracilis. The more the knees are extended, the more the gracilis is lengthened. Because the adductor longus and brevis work to flex and externally rotate the leg, it’s the abduction in the pose that lengthens these two of the adductor group",

The hamstrings will also lengthen with increased hip flexion, increasing as the feet move away and the knees extend more. Obstacles and Notes Much as in paschimottanasana, if the focus is too much on getting the head down, the resulting action is more spinal (flexion) than pelvic (sacroiliac and hip joints). For this reason, the intention should not be to get the head to the feet, but to get the navel to the feet. (continued) 94 The activity of the obturator internus in this pose also activates the muscles of the pelvic floor. This is an opportunity to engage mula bandha, which anchors the base of the pose. Depending on how close the feet are to the groin, different external rotators will be activated to assist with rotating the legs out and different adductors will be lengthened. Thus, it’s quite valuable to work with the feet at different dis- tances from the pelvis. Closer isn’t always better. Baddha konasana can be challenging for the knees. The supination of the feet (soles toward the ceiling) causes a rotation of the tibia that, combined with flex- ion, destabilizes the ligamentous support for the knees. If the hips are not very mobile and the legs are pushed into this pose, the lower leg torque can travel into the knee joints. One way to protect them is to evert the foot (press the outer edges into the floor). This activates the peroneals, which, via fascial connections, can stabilize the lateral ligaments of the knees and help to keep them from rotat- ing too much. The result of this will be to direct more of the pose’s action into the hip joints. Breathing The advice to bring the navel—rather than the head—to the feet is another way of saying that the breath should remain as unobstructed as possible in this pose",

Obstacles and Notes All parts of the torso can contribute to this twist—both right and left sides of the front and both right and left sides of the back, at different layers of muscle. The spine will have the most balanced rotation when in neutral extension. Flexion in the lumbar spine will jeopardize the stability of the lumbar vertebrae and discs, and too much extension will tend to lock the thoracic spine into place, inhibiting axial rotation there. The twisting action of this pose can be “faked” by overmobilizing the scapulae and allowing them to adduct (the back one) and abduct (the front one) exces- sively",

    "content": "When this happens there is the appearance of rotation, but not much actual movement in the spine. Because the shoulder girdle has more range of motion in this direction than the thoracic structures have, it is frequently a more intense spinal twist when the arms are placed in a simple, nonbound position. It is therefore preferable to enter this pose without using the arms, so the maxi- mum safe action is found in the spine. The leverage of the arms comes in last, as a deepening, stabilizing (not mobilizing) action. Overuse of the arms can direct too much force into vulnerable parts of the spine—particularly T11-T12. Another factor that contributes to the intensity of the spinal twisting action of this pose is the arrangement of the legs, which greatly limits rotational move- ments in the pelvis—and in fact counterrotates the pelvis away from the rotation of the spine. Breathing Ardha matsyendrasana provides a very clear opportunity to explore the basic dynamics of the breath as they relate to the principles of brahmana/langhana, prana/apana, and sthira/sukha. Ardha Matsyendrasana (continued) 99 The lower body is the stable base of the pose, and a langhana “belly breath- ing” pattern can release tension in the lower abdomen, hip joints, and pelvic floor. This approach to breathing stimulates the experience of apana flowing downward in the system, into the earth. The upper body is the mobile, supported aspect of the pose, and the brah- mana “chest breath” can be accomplished here simply by stabilizing the abdomi- nal wall upon the initiation of the inhalation. This will drive the diaphragm’s action into the rib cage and costovertebral articulations and greatly intensify deep rotational release in the thoracic spine. This breathing pattern is clearly related to the upward movement of apana, using the lower abdominal muscles to assist in driving the exhalation upward and outward from the body. In this pose, use a simple nonbound arm position and try doing several rounds of relaxed belly breathing to begin with",

Arm and torso proportions: short, neutral, and long. Spinal extensors Gastrocnemius Hamstrings 101 Working Spine: All spinal extensors, the psoas major and minor. Legs: The iliacus to flex the hips, the pectineus and adductor magnus to adduct and internally rotate the legs. The vastii extend the knees. (If this amount of flexion is challenging, the pectineus or rectus femoris might overwork to pull the pelvis into flexion against the backward pull of gravity.) Arms: The serratus anterior resists the adduction of the scapulae resulting from the push of the arms; the triceps extend the elbows. The flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, and the lumbricals of the hands, support the arch of the hand and prevent overflexing of the wrist (short-armed people would need a block under each hand to create this action). Lengthening Legs: The hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli all lengthen. Additionally, there will be some lengthening in the gluteus medius and minimus, as well as the gastrocnemius and soleus. Working at length (eccentrically) is the popliteus.

    "content": "Obstacles and Notes This pose clearly reveals how tightness in the legs can create spinal flexion. Obstacles that show up clearly in this pose are often the cause of difficulties in more complex poses, where the restrictions are less obvious. For example, tight- ness in the legs will affect downward-facing dog, but in a way that can appear to be more about shoulder or spinal restriction. Not everyone can use their arms to help create the neutral spinal extension in dandasana due to proportional differences in arm-to-body length. Conversely, what appears to be different arm-to-body proportions can sometimes be the result of chronically elevated or depressed positioning of the scapulae on the rib cage. Additionally, if the spine is unable to extend into vertical because of tight- ness in the hips and legs, the arms may seem too long. For students of vinyasa flows that involve jump-throughs, knowing your arm- to-torso proportions is absolutely essential. An inability to jump-through due to a long torso and short arms will not respond to any amount of stretching or strengthening. Use blocks under the hands to level the playing field. Breathing This is a straight-legged opportunity to breathe into an axially extended spine (mahamudra). Unlike pada hastasana, in which the legs are working to support the weight of the body, the legs are not “naturally” activated in dandasana. For this reason, the work in the legs is quite different, and for most people, more difficult to maintain. All three bandhas can be employed here, but it’s quite a challenge to do even 10 breaths while maintaining them with the proper body alignment. 102 Gomukhasana Cow-Faced Pose go-moo-KAHS-anna go = cow mukha = face Classification and Level Intermediate hip and shoulder opener Joint Actions Mostly neutral spine, with slight extension in the thoracic spine because of the arm position.

Obstacles and Notes Upward and downward rotation of the scapula needs to precede adduction to avoid overmobilizing in the shoulder joint. If the scapulae don’t mobilize, there can be too much movement in the glenohumeral joint causing overstretching in the joint capsule or impingements in the tendons of the biceps and supraspinatus. If the hips joints are not sufficiently mobile, excessive torque can result in the knee joints. Great care should be taken to avoid any strain in the knees, because the menisci are most vulnerable when the knee joints are semiflexed. Breathing Releasing the abdominal wall and directing the breath into the lower abdomen helps the pelvic floor and hip joints to release. Restraining the lower abdomen during an inhalation directs the breath into the thoracic region, which intensifies the stretching in the shoulder structures",

Gravity moves the weight of the body deeper into the position, but to do the pose safely, the body is not just passively releasing into gravity. Thus, most of the muscles listed as lengthening are also in some way working at length (eccentrically) to stabilize the pose. In addition, some muscles are working concentrically. Spine: Concentrically: extensors of the spine. Eccentrically: all the muscles listed as lengthening. Legs: Front leg: hamstrings, gluteus maximus, gastrocnemius, and soleus, eccentrically; articularis genus, maybe quadriceps, concentrically.

Obstacles and Notes In this difficult pose, the forward-bending action in the front leg/pelvic half combines with the backward-bending action in the back leg/pelvic half to create the challenge of keeping the spine balanced between those two contradictory actions. Because of the opposing action of the legs and pelvic halves, the forward- bending aspect of this pose is more difficult than a forward bend done with both legs, and vice versa. This is due to the opposition action of the other leg, which prevents the spine from doing the flexing or extending. Thus, all the movement in the lower half of the body must come from the sacroiliac joint, hip, and leg. Because there is generally more hip range of motion in flexion than in exten- sion, the movement of the back leg draws the spine into extension. This is also why more work is often felt in the extensors of the front leg than in the flexors of the back leg. In a way, this is a bound pose because of the way the action in each leg is lim- ited by the opposite leg",

    "content": "It is therefore possible to overmobilize vulnerable areas (hamstring attachments are especially at risk in this pose). This concern is greatly compounded if the pose is done passively. If hanumanasana is done more actively, with attention to the eccentric action of the lengthening muscles, the “stretch” of the pose can be distributed over several joints—stabilizing the mobile ones and mobilizing the fixated areas. Neu- romuscularly, this eccentric activity also stimulates the muscles’ spindle portion of the stretch reflex to release the muscles into greater length. Active use of the antagonistic muscles (for example, contracting the quadriceps) can also activate the “reciprocal innervation” stretch reflex, which stimulates the hamstrings to release further. In this pose, many people allow the back leg to externally rotate to get it “all the way down.” Letting the back leg roll out puts twisting pressure into the lumbar spine and/or the sacroiliac joint of the back leg—not to mention a twist- ing pressure into the back knee. It also puts more pressure into the adductors of Hanumanasana (continued) 107 the back leg (longus, brevis, pectineus, and gracilis) without the eccentric support of the iliacus and psoas major or rectus femoris. As a result, the groin gets over- stretched, and the usually overtight rectus femoris doesn’t get as much stretch as it could. It’s much more rigorous to do this correctly, and much safer for the legs and pelvis. Breathing You’ll know you’re doing this pose effectively when you can breathe freely. Until all the flexion, extension, and rotational forces have been neutralized, and the spine can extend easily, the breathing will tend to be labored and rough. The use of props such as blocks, straps, or blankets is highly recommended so that the work can be done in a gradual way that doesn’t excessively disturb the rhythm of the breath",

Working Gravity pulls the torso toward the floor. Spinal extensors Gracilis Hamstrings Spinal extensors 109 Spinal extensors can act to deepen hip flexion against the resistance of the arms. The extension of the spine presses the arms in this position against the legs, flex- ing the hips and knees, so the hamstrings activate to extend the hips. The vastii also extend the knees. The rhomboids and trapezius activate to adduct the scapulae; the posterior deltoids press the arms against the legs; and the biceps resist hyperextension in the elbows. Lengthening Legs (similar to upavistha konasana): The piriformis and gluteus maximus are working eccentrically because they are extensors of the hip; the obtura- tor externus and quadratus femoris are working eccentrically because they are also adductors. Of the adductors, the gracilis is especially stretched because of the knee extension; the pectineus is not affected because of the hip flexion. In the hamstrings, the semitendinosus and semimembrano- sus are particularly lengthened here because of the abduction of the legs. Spine: Extensors of the spine are lengthening, but active. As the pose deep- ens, it moves toward more thoracic extension. Spinal extensors lengthen to enter into the pose, then activate. Similarly, the rhomboids lengthen to get into the pose, then contract to reposition the scapulae.

This opposition of actions in the spine and scapulae mean that muscles such as the spinal extensors and rhomboids are asked to contract from a very lengthened position (one of the more challenging positions from which to concentrically con- tract a muscle). Because the arms are “bound” under the legs, there is the potential for forc- ing the action into vulnerable spots: The spine could overflex in the lumbar or thoracic regions, or the hamstrings could overstretch at their attachment on the sitting bones. Breathing The diaphragm receives considerable compression when entering into this position, and the gradual movement out of thoracic flexion can be seen as an attempt to reestablish the breathing space in the thoracic cavity.

This pose has the potential for directing too much force into the spine, sac- roiliac joint, and, with the arms bound in this position, the front of the shoulder joint. The subscapularis is working to both internally rotate the humerus and pro- tect the joint from protraction. The more freedom there is in the scapulae gliding on the rib cage, the less force will be directed into the glenohumeral joint and its capsule. The bound position of the legs behind the skull and cervical spine creates potential stress in this area, too—either overstretching the back of the neck or overworking the muscles against the push of the legs. If there isn’t enough mobility in the rest of the spine, the cervical spine can be overflexed to get the legs in position. This should be avoided. Breathing Good luck. Actually, once locked into this bound pose, the abdominal muscles don’t have much to do, so they can be released for good old belly breaths. This is actually advisable, because excessive abdominal action during trunk flexion can stress an already vulnerable neck",

    "content": "A simplified way of thinking about this position is that it combines a forward bend (flexion of the lumbar and cervical spine), a backward bend (extension of the thoracic spine), and a twist (axial rotation of the thoracic spine and the turn- ing of the pelvis toward the extended leg). A lack of flexibility in any of the structures listed earlier in the “Lengthening” section will lead to excessive action in the “Working” muscles. This will lead to the expenditure of too much energy and the demand for too much oxygen— which will make it impossible to maintain the bandhas. Mahamudra (continued) 115 Breathing Executing this pose properly while engaging all three bandhas is considered to be the ultimate test of the breath. The reason for this is that mahamudra freezes all the normal respiratory movements out of the body cavities: There is strong sta- bilizing action in the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, the rib cage is held in a lifted position, the costovertebral joints are immobilized by thoracic twisting, and the sternum is lifted into the chin by the scalenes. All in all, the body is forced to find another, unusual way to breathe. When all the usual, visible, external breath movements have been stabilized, something deep in the core of the system must mobilize via a new pathway. That pathway is commonly referred to in yogic literature as susumna—the central channel. 116 Navasana Boat Pose nah-VAHS-anna nava = boat Classification and Level Basic seated balance—abdominal strengthener Joint Actions Spine neutral extension, resisting flexion; sacroiliac joint neutral, resisting counternutation; hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle neutral extension; scapula neutral (if arms extended to shoulder height); glenohumeral joint flexion, lateral adduction, slight external rota- tion; forearm neutral rotation",

Variation with arms extended. Obstacles and Notes In this pose the challenge is not the position itself, so much as its relationship to gravity. If it were rotated 45 degrees, it would just be the work of sitting verti- cally in dandasana (which can certainly present its own challenges). Ideally, the weight in this pose is distributed between the sitting bones and the tailbone. All the weight should not be borne on the sacrum, because that would create a destabilizing counternutation in the sacroiliac joints. If dandasana is a challenge because of tight hamstrings, that tightness will make it impossible to support this pose correctly with the legs straight. In this case, bending the knees so the spine can remain neutral is a good option. It is an interesting challenge to have to work hard to maintain a neutral spine, as opposed to working to get the spine into flexion, extension, or rotation. This asana is often described as working the abdominal muscles. This is true; however, the abdominal muscles do not hold the weight of the pose. Rather, they are modulators of the action of creating hip flexion, which is mainly per- formed by the psoas major and iliacus. If the psoas is difficult to access, it is pos- sible to overwork the rectus femoris or tensor fascia latae in this pose",

Lengthening Hamstrings. 119 kneeling poses 119 6 C h a p t e r W hen kneeling, the body’s weight is on the knees, shins, and parts of the feet. Kneeling brings the center of gravity closer to the ground and makes certain activi- ties, such as gardening, less stressful for the spine. Without proper care, however, kneeling can be stressful for the knee joints. This position is also associated with “lowering oneself” in the sense of meekness or wor- ship. This probably evolved from the fact that when kneeling, a person is defenseless and unable to flee. Even the proud, upright stance of kings and pharaohs is tempered by their frequent depiction in this humble position. In yoga, kneeling poses are often used to help open the hip and knee joints. When the body’s weight is taken off the feet and legs, the pelvic muscle attachments can be stretched because they no longer stabilize the body weight high off the ground. Kneeling also provides a stable base from which the center of gravity can be raised up so the spine can fully extend—most beautifully expressed in poses such as camel (ustrasana) and pigeon (kapotasana). A position that’s frequently used to counterpose strong spinal extensions is child’s pose, the kneeling position that produces mild, even spinal flexion and lowers the center of gravity.

    "content": "Because hip extension in internal rotation is more challenging than in external rotation for most people, supta virasana “forces” the pelvis to be honest about how open the groins truly are. This pose often begins as spinal extension, espe- cially if there is tightness in the hip flexors, because the internal rotation of the legs is bound into place by the weight of the body. If the hip extensors are tight and the pose is “pushed,” the force can be transmitted either into the lower back or into the knees. In either case, the pose should be supported in a way that allows for maximum hip extension; getting down to the floor is less important. Because the knees are at risk, keeping the feet active and avoiding supination is important for maintaining integrity in the knee joints. This can be an excellent pose for sciatic and lower-back pain, if done with attention to the internal rotation and extension in the hips. If poorly executed, the pose can exacerbate lower-back pain. Breathing The tautness in the psoas and abdominal wall creates both posterior and anterior pressure in the abdominal cavity. This effect is magnified when activating the abdominal muscles to flatten the lumbar curve. The resulting breathing patterns would favor movements above and below the abdominal pressure. Emphasizing thoracic breath movements at the base of the rib cage helps to mobilize the upper spine and shoulder girdle. Focusing on pelvic floor move- ments assists in releasing tension in the hips, groin, and gluteal region",

Working Gravity draws the yielding body deeper into this position. Lengthening The challenge of this pose is to bring the sitting bones to the heels and the forehead to the floor. To do so, many things have to lengthen: the extensors of the spine, gluteus maximus, piriformis and other rotators, hamstrings, gluteus medius and minimus (because of hip adduction), tibi- alis anterior, peroneus tertius, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and extensor hallucis longus and brevis in the feet. Obstacles and Notes Variations include widening the knees (hip abduction), which can create more neutral extension in the spine and make room for the belly; extending the arms overhead; clasping the heels with the hands; crossing the arms under the fore- head; and turning the head to one side. Sometimes there is congestion in the front of the hip joints, which can be caused by using the hip flexors to pull the body down toward the thighs, rather than allowing gravity to create that action. The use of props can assist in this release. Restriction can also be felt in the tops of the feet, if the extensors of the toes are tight or if there is a lack of mobility in the bones of the foot. Additionally, weakness in the intrinsic muscles of the foot will often result in cramping in this, and similar positions (such as virasana and vajrasana)",

    "content": "Spine: In the cervical spine, the anterior neck muscles listed earlier are work- ing at length, but the sternocleidomastoid should be lengthened and relaxed to avoid the base of the skull being pulled into the atlas and axis. The scalenes are also providing support for the anterior spine, as well as the breath (discussed later). In the thoracic region, the internal intercostals are stretched by the opening of the rib cage, as are the scalenes (which are the cranial continuation of the intercostal layers). Obstacles and Notes In camel, a mild internal rotation of the legs is recommended to keep the sacro- iliac joints stable, which will favor hip and spinal extension over sacroiliac coun- ternutation (which is what happens when this pose is felt “in the small of the back”). It can be very challenging to find a healthy extension of the spine at the base of the neck or the top of the thoracic spine. It helps to focus on releasing the sternocleidomastoid using the eccentric strength of the deeper anterior neck muscles to stabilize the weight of the head. Additionally, in many people, the upper trapezius muscles form a “shelf” in this position that can provide a resting place for some of the weight of the head. Camel is an intense stretch for the digestive system, especially the esophagus. Breathing In ustrasana, the thoracic structures are maintained in an “inhaled” position, and the abdominal wall is stretched. This results in a decreased ability of the body to breathe “normally.” The trick is to find support from the deeper musculature so the more superficial efforts can quiet down. Then it’s possible to notice an inter- esting relationship between the deepest layer of superficial neck muscles (sca- lenes) and the breath movement in the apex of the lungs, which are suspended from the inner scalene muscles",

This asana has a unique base of sup- port: the back surface of the front leg and the front surface of the back leg. This same base, with the knee joints extended, would be hanumanasana. Joint Actions Spinal extension. Front leg: nutation; hip flexion, external rotation, and abduction; knee flexion; ankle and foot supination. Back leg: counternuta- tion; hip extension, internal rotation, and adduction; knee flexion; ankle plantarflexion. Working Spine: The spinal extensors work to create the backbend; then the extensors and obliques work to maintain balance and an orientation to the front. The actions in the spine are very similar in this pose to those in natarajasana (see chapter 4), although the action of gravity is slightly different (there is perhaps less anterior tilt to the pelvis, and thus more action in the back hip). Back leg: Same action as natarajasana; the internal rotation and extension has the joint capsule most taut. Arms: Same action as natarajasana. Front leg: Gravity is the main force. The hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and peroneals work eccentrically, pressing into the floor, to keep from collaps- ing into the pose. Lengthening When the front leg is abducted, there is generally less stretch of the rotators, although the obturator externus and quadratus femoris are slightly more length- ened with abduction.

    "content": "More stretch is actually felt in the hamstrings, in spite of the knee flexion. When the front leg is adducted, the action of flexion and adduction at the hip lengthens the piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli mainly—and the obtura- tor externus and quadratus femoris slightly less. When the knee is more extended in the front leg (toward 90 degrees of flex- ion), the rotation at the hip is greatly intensified. This action may be felt in the gluteus medius and minimus, and/or in the adductor magnus or adductor longus. This action puts more pressure into the knee, especially if there is restriction in the hip joint, and the knee is much more vulnerable to twisting forces when at 90 degrees. The action in the feet and ankles can help to stabilize and protect the knee. (continued) 128 Folded forward variation. This variation intensifies the action in the ham- strings of the front leg because of deeper hip flexion and more body weight over the front leg. At the same time, it diminishes the action in the back hip and in the spine. By adducting the front leg, the piriformis is brought into the lengthening action. This is perhaps the most frequently used stretch for the infamous piriformis. Because this muscle crosses over the largest nerve in the body, the sciatic nerve, tightness in this muscle can be a cause of sciatic pain. This variation of pigeon pose helps to release tension in the piriformis in a mostly passive, relaxed position, as opposed to the more active base required of the full pigeon. Being a deep hip stabilizer, the piriformis requires at least a minute of sustained stretching to release its spindle reflex and actually begin lengthening. Before the release of the spindles, the main sensation is actually of the muscles resisting the stretch to protect themselves from injury. When viewing this pose from underneath, you can see clearly that the sciatic nerve is also stretched in this position",

The pelvic floor, hamstrings, and gluteals should act eccentrically to distribute the weight force of gravity through the whole base of the pose rather than drop right into the hamstring attachment or knee joint. As with all poses, and more so with complex ones, a wide variety of experi- ences are available, depending on each person’s strength, balance, and range of motion. Variation Folded Forward Sciatic nerve Sciatic nerve 129 The following illustrations show the relationship of the sciatic nerve to the piri- formis muscle in the following: 1. Neutral hip position (figure a). 2. External rotation and abduction, which actually shortens the piriformis (figure b). 3. Hip flexion, which begins the stretch of the piriformis and other external rotators (figure c). 4. Hip flexion combined with adduction, which puts the piriformis into maxi- mal stretch, along with the sciatic nerve (figure d). When entering this stretch from the kneeling position, the hip joint is already in flexion. It is then externally rotated as it’s brought into maximal flexion, and then moved into adduction before the body’s weight is placed on it. As men- tioned previously, extending the knee joint to 90 degrees greatly increases the torque on the hip joint, and thus the stretch to the rotators, but poses greater risk to the knee joint.

Extended leg: Hamstrings, gracilis, adductor magnus. Obstacles and Notes Rotation is automatic with side bending in the spine because of both the shape of the articular facets in the vertebrae and the spiral pathways of the muscles. To keep the action “pure” lateral flexion, there needs to be a counterrotation in the rib cage. In this case, the upper ribs rotate posteriorly and the lower ribs rotate anteriorly. To achieve this, the internal obliques on the upper side and the exter- nal obliques on the lower side are recruited. Also, if there is tightness in the outside of the standing leg hip joint (in the tensor fascia lata, gluteus medius, or gluteus minimus), then that hip will try to flex rather than stay purely adducted. The standing leg should maintain hip extension (via the adductor magnus and hamstrings) to prevent this. When there is tightness in the latissimus dorsi, lifting the arm overhead can push the rib cage forward (compressing the floating ribs and inhibiting breath in general), or pull the scapula downward even as the arm is lifting—potentially creating impingement of the biceps tendon or supraspinatus at the acromion pro- cess. Folding the upper arm behind the back eliminates this concern and allows the focus to remain on the torso movement.

Additionally, the platysma (the flat, thin, rectangular muscle that covers the front of the throat) can be tonified during simhasana.

    "content": "Just as tadasana and samasthiti are the quintessential standing positions, savasana is the prototypical supine position. In the corpse pose, the back surface of the body becomes the base of support, and all the postural muscles can relax from their constant dance with gravity. Savasana has the lowest center of gravity and is the starting point of all the supine poses. It is also the position in which those asanas usually end. Because no effort is required to stabilize the body while it is supine, poses that evolve from here are—by definition—mostly langhana (see page 16) and become more brahmana as the center of gravity is raised higher. Moving into postures from a supine position engages the anterior musculature of the body, which is why many abdominal strengthening exercises start in this position. 136 Savasana Corpse Pose shah-VAHS-anna sava = corpse Occasionally, this pose is referred to as the death pose, or mrtasana (mrit-TAHS- anna). Mrta means death. Classification and Level Depending on the perspective, either very easy or very advanced Working Gravity and mental focus. The corpse pose is said to be the easiest asana to perform, but the hardest to master. Whatever gymnastics demands the other asanas may make to your bal- ance, strength, or flexibility, the challenge of completely releasing the tension from every part of the body and mind is perhaps the greatest test of the yogi. Anatomy Primary and Secondary Curves In savasana, the structures that are in full, weight-bearing contact with the floor exhibit the primary curves of the body (see chapter 2). These include the pos- terior surfaces of the calcaneus, gastocnemius, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, sacrum, thoracic spine, scapulae, and occiput. The structures that are off the floor mirror the secondary curves of the body— specifically, the posterior surfaces of the Achilles tendons, knee joints, lumbar region, and cervical spine",

    "content": "The point of contact of the arms varies widely from person to person, depend- ing on the unique shape and relationships of the upper-body structures—particu- larly the elbow joint. 137 Symmetry Many people never fully relax in savasana because of an obsession with arrang- ing the body in a perfectly symmetrical shape, which they verify visually, but which conflicts with the body’s kinesthetic (proprioceptive) feedback. In other words, what looks symmetrical is not what feels symmetrical. Because all human bodies are inherently asymmetrical, a certain amount of surrender to this fact is necessary to achieve a deep state of emotional, as well as physical, relaxation. If you want to fully relax, you need to accept your body as it is, not as you would wish it to be. Breathing A deep state of conscious relaxation is quite different from sleep, which is a common experience in this pose. In savasana, the body is completely at rest and its metabolism is freed of the demands of contending with gravity, making it pos- sible to practice the most difficult breathing exercise of all: the act of being fully aware of—but not controlling—the breath’s movements. Normally, when you are aware of your breathing, in some way you alter its natural rhythm. When you are not aware of the breath, it is driven by a combi- nation of autonomic impulses and unconscious habit. The juxtaposition of active awareness and surrender to the breath’s natural movements makes possible the powerful realization that true surrender is an act of will.

    "content": "The main difference between setu bandhasana and dwi pada pitham is that dwi pada pitham is a vinyasa, a dynamic movement that is coordinated with the inhalation and exhalation. This simple, yet versatile practice can be used in a variety of ways to release tension from the spine and breathing structures, as well as to help balance the leg and hip actions that support similar poses, such as setu bandhasana and upward bow, or wheel (see chapter 9). Breathing The lifting movement is typically done on the inhalation and the lowering on the exhalation, but this pattern can be changed to produce various effects. For example, the three bandhas can be very easily activated simply by doing the low- ering movement on an external retention (bhaya kumbaka). Lowering the spine on a retention after an exhalation creates a natural lifting of the pelvic floor and abdominal contents toward the zone of lowered pressure in the thoracic cavity. The subsequent inhalation can create a dramatic downward release of the pelvic floor and a noticeable sense of relaxation in this often tense region. 140 Apanasana Apana Pose ap-AN-ahs-anna apana = the “vital air” that eliminates waste from the system Inhale. Exhale. 141 Another simple, yet useful practice that directly links breath and body movement, apanasana is one of the key tools of therapeutic yoga. It stimulates the upward release of the dia- phragm on the exhalation, as the knees are drawn into the body. Traditionally this is done by actively using the abdominal and hip flexor muscles without the assistance of the arms, which are just “along for the ride.” An inter- esting difference can be felt if the hip flexors and abdominal muscles are relaxed and the arms are used actively to “pump” the thighs against the abdomen, deepening the exhalation",

In viparita karani the abdominal muscles are strongly active in eccentric contraction. If they do not have the ability to modulate their lengthen- ing, the weight of the pelvis will collapse onto the hands or wrists. Practicing the ability to enter and leave this pose will help with other actions that require abdominal eccentric control—for example, dropping the legs over into the wheel from a headstand or handstand, controlling vrksasana, dropping back into the wheel from tadasana, and so forth. Body proportions and individual differences in weight distribution between the upper and lower body will greatly affect the experience of this pose",

In the shoulders, the serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major all lengthen. Obstacles and Notes Entering the pose from the plow (halasana) is more demanding on the extensors of the spine, especially the thoracic spine, because they are in an elongated posi- tion before contracting. Entering from the bridge pose (setu bandhasana) is more demanding on the extensors of the shoulder joints and the flexors of the spine (the psoas and abdominal muscles). From the perspective of the muscles of the spine and abdomen, being in this pose is less challenging than getting into it. However, remaining in the pose is more challenging for the muscles of the scapulae, because they are all bearing the static load of the body while either contracting or lengthening. To truly be a shoulder stand, the muscles that adduct, downwardly rotate, and elevate the scapulae must be strong enough to take the weight of the entire body. If they are not, and the shoulders spread apart, the weight falls too much on the upper thoracic and cervical spine. Breathing The more mobility there is in the scapulae (or the less resistance from other mus- cles of the thorax), the less compromised the breath will be in this position. This pose takes a tremendous amount of both flexibility and strength in the entire shoulder girdle. Without the integrity of the shoulder girdle, the weight collapses down into the thorax, and the diaphragm becomes obstructed. Keeping the base of the rib cage open allows the diaphragm and abdominal viscera to shift effectively toward the head so the full benefits of inversion can occur",

    "content": "If the scapulae are not maintained in adduction, the weight of the body falls into the spine; if the scapulae do not upwardly rotate, the arms are chal- lenged in reaching to the knees. The scapulae are positioned in neutral rotation as they extend to the knees, but the action that gets them there is upward rota- tion, as they come from the downward rotation of sarvangasana. The upper fibers of the psoas major and abdominal muscles are very strongly engaged here to maintain the spinal flexion in the thoracic spine. In addition, more lumbar flexion occurs to bring the legs farther overhead and counterbal- ance the pull of gravity. Reducing this tendency toward lumbar flexion makes the spinal flexors work much harder eccentrically—against the body weight’s ten- dency to roll down to the floor. In this balancing act between spinal flexors and extensors, imbalances that are usually imperceptible show up, because the arms aren’t available to lever- age symmetry. When these torques appear, they make this pose that much more challenging to balance. Breathing In niralamba sarvangasana, the intense action in the full-body’s flexor and exten- sor groups creates quite a challenge to the shape change of breathing. Because this is a challenging balance pose that requires a lot of stabilizing action in the abdominal and thoracic musculature, any attempt at deep breathing will destabi- lize the pose even as the full-body activation of these major muscle groups cre- ates a demand for significant oxygenation. Efficiency—finding the minimum amount of effort necessary to maintain the position—allows the limited breath movements to supply just enough energy to sustain the pose",

Obstacles and Notes It can be a challenge to get full hip extension in this pose. If the hamstrings and adductor magnus are not strong enough, the gluteus maximus may do too much and pull the legs into external rotation; or the other adductors will activate to bring the knees together but also flex the hips; or the rectus femoris will work to extend the knees, but won’t fully extend the hips. Spinal extensors, especially lumbar, may try to help, but too much lumbar extension is not helpful, because it will limit hip extension by putting tension on the psoas complex. The action in the arms is the same as for the shoulder stand and viparita karani; the action in the hips and legs is the same as for lifting into urdhva dha- nurasana. All in all, considering the many muscle actions that must be balanced for this pose to work, sustaining this basic posture actually requires a high degree of coordination. Breathing The three bandhas can be active here, as in viparita karani. The main difference is that in bridge pose, mula bandha must be applied much more actively and against the lengthened resistance of the abdominal wall",

    "content": "For example, consider the variation of extending the arms overhead and clasping the toes. As in karnapidasana and nirlamba sar- vangasana, this upwardly rotates the scapulae and makes the adduction of the scapulae difficult to maintain—the rhomboids and trapezius then lengthen, and weight falls into the upper spine. This variation can overstretch the thoracic and cervical spine, as there is potentially damaging pressure from the pushing action of the feet and, if the hamstrings and gluteals are tight, from the limited hip flex- ion forcing greater spinal flexion. Because this pose can produce very intense flexion for the spine, especially the cervical region, it’s more important to maintain the integrity of the scapulae and cervical and thoracic spine than to get the legs to the floor—support the legs, if necessary, to protect the neck. Breathing As in the shoulder stand, keeping the base of the rib cage open allows the dia- phragm and abdominal viscera to shift effectively toward the head, so the full benefits of inversion can occur. This can be much more of a challenge in this pose, because the hip flexion tends to create more intra-abdominal pressure. Halasana is a very good gauge of how freely you can breathe. It’s one thing to have the muscular flexibility to get into the pose, but quite another to have the diaphragm and organs be free enough to remain there and breathe comfortably. 154 Karnapidasana Ear-to-Knee Pose karna-peed-AHS-anna karna = ear pidana = squeeze, pressure Classification and Level Intermediate inverted forward bend Joint Actions Spinal flexion, hip and knee flexion, scapula abduction and upward rotation, arm flexion, elbow flexion.

Arms: The rhomboids and trapezius are lengthened here by the abduction of the scapulae and the pressure of the lower body into the upper back. Obstacles and Notes This counterposes the shoulder action of sarvangasana because the spinal exten- sion and scapular adduction of shoulder stand is reversed, so the muscles that were active are now lengthening. If the release is too passive, however, the mus- cles can be overstretched. The support shifts in this pose to the spinous processes of the thoracic spine from the scapulae and trapezius. Breathing In ear-to-knee pose, the weight of the lower body is bearing down into the torso, which is in maximal flexion—this is basically, an inverted, weight-bearing exhalation. The restriction that this position imposes on the breath shouldn’t be a problem as long as the body is flexible enough to be in repose. If the muscles are tense, the limited capacity to breathe will soon result in the muscles’ inability to fuel their activity; at this point, the asana should be exited.

Gluteus maximus External obliques Pectoralis major Internal obliques Scalenes 157 Notes As this asana’s name would indicate, the belly region of the body is the focus of this twist; therefore, many people assume that this twist arises from the lumbar spine. This is incorrect, however, because the lumbar spine is extremely limited in axial rotation (5 degrees total). The first joint above the sacrum that is capable of significant twisting is T11-T12, and that is where the opposition of the rib cage to the pelvis begins. To ensure that this twist is evenly distributed throughout the spine, it is important to maintain a neutral spine. This is a challenge with both knees bent, because it’s much easier to move into lumbar flexion to deepen the rotation. However, this puts pressure into the lumbar vertebrae and discs, as well as loading the T11-T12 disc. Another challenge to the neutral spine is that tightness in the lateral line will pull the spine into extension, lifting the far shoulder off the floor and compressing the brachial plexus. This often results in sensations of numbness or tingling in the arm. Breathing Because the body is supported by the floor, and the main action is provided by gravity, the breathing and postural muscles are free to release in jathara parivrtti. The breath can thus be directed in various ways to achieve specific effects. Bringing the breath move- ments to the abdomen, for example, will release the tone in the abdominal wall and pelvic floor and assist in reducing extraneous muscle tension in the lumbar region",

Obstacles and Notes This pose can be done while focusing on using spinal extensors (which include the psoas major on the front of the spine) or supported on the elbows. If the Sternocleidomastoid Rectus abdominis 159 support of the elbows is used, there is less work in the muscles of the torso and perhaps more ease in breathing and more expansion. If the pose is done while focusing on the muscles that extend the spine, the neck will be better protected when lifting the arms off the floor. Variations can also be done with blocks under the spine, and with the feet in baddha konasana (see chapter 5) or padmasana. This pose is a great demonstration of the role of the psoas major in both hip flexion and spinal extension. Fish pose is frequently used as an immediate counterpose to the shoulder stand because it reverses the position of the cervical spine from extreme flexion to extreme extension. However, going from one static extreme to the other may not be the most beneficial way to compensate for the stresses of the shoulder stand. A more therapeutic approach would be to gradually reverse the move- ment of the neck with simple vinyasas leading up to cobra pose (bhujangasana; see chapter 8). Breathing In fish pose, the chest is expanded, but not as maximally as in the more difficult arm-supported urdhva dhanurasana. As a result, there is still room for the inhal- ing action to further expand the rib cage, using the arms as leverage",

Lengthening Top leg: Hamstrings, adductor magnus, gracilis, pectineus (of the adductor group, these are the most lengthened). Bottom leg: Adductor longus and brevis, gracilis. Obstacles and Notes Generally, when the leg is lifted, the pelvis and lower body twist backward. The challenge is to find the counteraction deep in the pelvis rather than through rotating the spine. The gluteus maximus and rotators can be used in the bottom leg to stabilize the pelvic half only if that bottom leg is well grounded. Breathing Anantasana is one of the few true side-lying poses. In side lying, the dome of the diaphragm closest to the floor moves cranially (toward the head), while the other dome moves caudally (toward the tail). This is due mainly to the effect of gravity on the abdominal organs, which are pulled toward the floor, taking the diaphragm with them. In addition, the lung closest to the floor (the dependent lung) becomes more supported, and its tissue becomes more compliant, meaning that it’s under less mechanical tension and responds more easily to the action of the diaphragm. Consciously creating this asymmetry in the respiratory mechanism can be useful in breaking up deeply ingrained breathing habits. For example, this pose can be beneficial to people trying to change the habit of sleeping on only one side of the body. 163 prone poses 163 C h a p t e r 8 P rone means lying in a facedown position. Moving into postures from a prone position engages the posterior musculature of the body, which is why many back-strengthening exercises start in this position",

Using the latissimus dorsi and other more superficial mus- cles will affect the scapulae and rib cage and interfere with breathing by inhibit- ing the movement of the ribs. In cobra, the serratus anterior is active to maintain a neutral position of the scapulae against the push of the arms. When the arms push, the shoulders don’t elevate, but the spine is lifted. The latissimus dorsi are not helpful as extensors of the spine, because they create flexion of the upper back and internal rotation in the arms. Weakness in the pronators of the forearm, or tightness in the supinators (or interosseus membrane), will make the elbows flare out to the side and will affect both the elbow and shoulder joints. The forearms should stay parallel to each other for the best alignment of action through the arms into the spine.

Gluteus maximus Hamstrings Quadriceps Variation Cobra With Knees Flexed In this position, the hamstrings are used for both actions: hip extension and knee flexion. This position of the leg puts the hamstrings at a very short working length, which greatly increases the chances of cramping in the muscles. This position also makes it more likely that the outer fibers of the gluteus max- imus will fire to help with the hip extension, which will also externally rotate and abduct the legs. Often, a student who can keep the legs adducted and parallel when the knees are extended will find it much more challenging when the knees are flexed. In this position, all of the quadriceps are lengthened, and the stretch in the rectus femoris can restrict the range of motion in knee flexion, too. 168 Dhanurasana Bow Pose don-your-AHS-anna dhanu = bow Classification and Level Basic or intermediate prone backbend Joint Actions Spine extension; sacrum counternutation; hip extension, medial rotation, adduction; knee flexion; ankle plantarflexion; scapula adduction, elevation; glenohumeral joint medial rotation, extension, adduction; elbow extension; forearm pronation; finger and hand flexion.

Lengthening Legs: Because of hip extension, the rectus femoris, the lower fibers of the psoas, the iliacus, and possibly the pectineus and tensor fascia latae. Notes The front of the shoulder joint is structurally vulnerable in this position. If the scapulae are not mobilized in the direction of the stretch (adduction, elevation), too much pressure could be put into the anterior glenohumeral joint, resulting in an overstretch of the subscapularis or damage to the joint capsule. Because this is a bound pose, the pressure into these vulnerable joints is greater. This pose can be “worked” in a variety of ways by emphasizing different actions: by deepening the action in the spine, by increasing hip extension, or by using knee extension to deepen spine and hip extension. The balance of actions in the hip and knee will be affected depending on whether the hamstrings or the quadriceps are more activated. Because this is a bound pose, with the hands grasping the ankles, it is possible to put too much pressure into the knees. Thus, the alignment of the leg at the hip and the activation of the feet are important to maintain the integrity of the knee. Breathing It is a common practice to rock back and forth in this pose by pushing the belly into the floor with each inhalation. It is less common (but much more intense) to practice not rocking by directing the inhalation into the already expanded chest region",

    "content": "This is because many of the muscle actions that lift and support the body in this position create other actions that must be neu- tralized by opposing or synergistic muscles. For example, because the gluteus maximus, a powerful hip extensor, also externally rotates the legs, it’s preferable to use the hamstrings for hip extension. Additionally, the gluteus medius and minimus, which help with internal rotation, also happen to abduct the leg, so the adductors will kick in to keep the legs together. Therefore, there are always lots of synergistic actions going on. People will have different priorities, or challenges, depending on where they start and their preexisting patterns of strength/weak- ness and flexibility/tightness. Breathing To rock, or not to rock? All the weight of the body is brought to bear on the abdomen in this variation of locust. While holding the pose for several breaths, the body will rock back and forth with the action of the diaphragm if the primary breathing pattern is “belly breath.” An interesting challenge is to keep from rock- ing, which necessitates a release in the thoracic structures and diaphragm, allow- ing the floor to push into the abdomen, rather than the abdomen pushing into the floor. 172 Viparita Salabhasana Full Locust Pose vip-par-ee-tah sha-la-BAHS-anna viparita = reversed, inverted salabha = grasshopper, locust Classification and Level Advanced symmetrical backward bend Joint Actions Spine extension, sacrum counternutation; hip extension, medial rotation, adduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; scapula downward rota- tion, elevation, abduction; glenohumeral joint external rotation, flexion, adduction; elbow extension; forearm neutral; wrist neutral.

Notes From the previous analysis of muscular actions, it’s clear that what it takes to get into this pose is almost completely the opposite of what it takes to remain in it. Lifting the weight of the body into spinal extension requires a strong, integrated action of the arms and spinal extensors. Once past vertical, gravity will pull the weight of the body into extension, so the trunk flexors must kick in to prevent hyperextension. Therefore, based on their balance of strength and flexibility in the extensor and flexor muscle groups, some people may have the ability to get into full locust, but not to sustain it; whereas others can’t get there themselves, but can stay there if assisted into the pose. Breathing The standard instruction to inhale while entering into a backbend can be coun- terproductive here. This is because a strong contraction of the diaphragm will draw the base of the rib cage and lumbar spine (the diaphragm’s origin) toward the central tendon (its insertion). This can create considerable resistance to the lengthening in the deep front line of the body. Exhaling while lifting the body into the pose works better for many people. Remaining in the pose requires the abdominal wall to remain tautly active, which can limit abdominal breath movement, while the actions that synergize the push of the arms into the floor tend to limit thoracic excursion. In addition, having the neck in weight-bearing extension can add resistance to the airway, not to mention that all of this is happening in an inverted position.

Rectus capitis anterior Longus colli 175 arm support poses 175 C h a p t e r 9 I n spite of their obvious similarities, the upper and lower extremities of the human body have evolved to perform specific functions. The structure of the foot, knee, hip, and pelvis points to their function of support and locomotion. The highly mobile structures of the hand, elbow, and shoulder girdle are clearly ill-suited to weight bearing. In fact, if you compare the proportional structure of the hand and foot, you will see a completely inverse relationship between the weight-bearing and articular structures within them. In the foot, the heavy, dense tarsal bones comprise half the length of its structure. Adding to this the weight-bearing function of the metatarsals, it can be said that four fifths of the foot’s structure is dedicated to weight bearing. The foot’s phalangeal structures contribute only one fifth of its total length. These proportions are completely reversed in the hand, where half the length of the structure is composed of the highly mobile phalangeal bones. The hand’s metacarpals are also very mobile (compared to the metatarsals), whereas the relatively immobile carpals (wrist bones) comprise only one fifth of the total length of the hand. This means that, even if you effectively recruit the metacarpals in arm support, you still have only half the length of the hand available for weight bearing. The bottom line is that when you use the hand in weight-bearing poses, you have to respect the fact that it is at a structural disadvantage. You must therefore compensate for this fact when you prepare for and execute such poses. In modern Western culture, many people overuse and misuse their arms and hands while working at computers. This is why all the arm supports in this book are categorized as intermediate or advanced; beginning students don’t put weight on their hands until they’ve fully experienced standing on their feet",

Fundamentally, it is a great opportunity to observe the effects of the arms and legs on the spine. Assuming the spine is in neutral, or axial extension, then you move toward flexion in both the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint and the hip joint and toward extension in the elbow and knee. Spine neutral or axial extension; scapula upward rotation and elevation, ini- tially abducted, but advanced students move toward adduction; glenohu- meral joint flexion and external rotation; elbow extension; forearm prona- tion and wrist extension; sacrum nutation; hip flexion (with perhaps some internal rotation); knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion. Gastrocnemius Hamstrings Gluteus maximus Latissimus dorsi Deltoid Rectus femoris Serratus anterior Triceps 177 Working Spine: Psoas minor, obliques; deep extensors work very precisely to maintain neutral spinal alignment (axial extension). Legs: Working against gravity. If the hamstrings are tight, the hip flexors (ilia- cus, rectus femoris, pectineus) may activate to assist with hip flexion, but this is not actually desirable. The adductor magnus internally rotates and moves the femur back. To extend the knee, the vastii and articularis genus activate. To deepen the dorsiflexion in the ankle, the intrinsic foot muscles need to maintain the integrity of the arches of the foot, so the extrinsic muscles can release in the ankle. Arms: Also working against gravity. The serratus anterior upwardly rotates and abducts the scapulae, while the infraspinatus, teres minor, and pos- terior deltoids work to externally rotate the glenohumeral joints. Because the flexion of the glenohumeral joints is created by gravity, the anterior deltoids can relax. To extend the elbow and resist collapse in the shoulder, the triceps are active",

    "content": "To extend the elbow and resist collapse in the shoulder, the triceps are active. The latissimus dorsi often try to help this action, but they depress and internally rotate the shoulder, which creates impingement at the acromion process. The pronators are active in the forearm, but if there is lack of rotation between the radius and ulna, this can translate into overarticulation in the elbow or wrist, or internal rotation of the arm at the shoulder joint—all common sites of injury for practitioners of vinyasa styles of yoga that employ repetitive downward- facing dogs in sun salutations. As in the foot and leg, the intrinsic action in the hand is essential for the inte- gration of the whole arm. Essentially, the hand must act as much as a foot as possible by maintaining its arch. The flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris should acti- vate to resist the collapse of the hand. Lengthening Spine: Diaphragm, intercostals. Legs: Hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, gluteus maximus. Release is needed in the psoas major, iliacus, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, tensor fascia latae, and pectineus. Arms: Latissimus dorsi and teres major are lengthening. The long head of the triceps is working eccentrically (at length). Breathing From the perspective of the breath, downward-facing dog is an inversion with the spine in axial extension. Because inversions naturally move the diaphragm cranially, the exhaling action of the abdominal muscles can be quite deep. If the lower abdominal action is maintained when initiating the inhalation (mula bandha), the thoracic structures will be encouraged to mobilize, which can be quite challenging in an arm support pose",

Obstacles and Notes If the goal is to have extension distributed throughout the whole spine, there will need to be more action in the thoracic region and less in the lumbar and cervi- cal regions. This translates into concentric work for the extensors in the thoracic spine and eccentric work for the flexors in the cervical and lumbar spines. The latissimus dorsi are not so helpful in this pose, because they can fix the scapulae on the rib cage and inhibit extension in the thoracic spine. They also produce internal rotation of the humerus and downward rotation of the scapu- lae, which oppose the actions of upward-facing dog. Depending on where restrictions are, the humerus can be pulled into either internal or external rotation. Sometimes the external rotation that is active in downward-facing dog needs to be modulated coming into upward-facing dog, because the whole hand–scapula relationship shifts relative to the spine. Breathing As the counterpose to the “exhaled” downward-facing dog, this pose is clearly related to the expansive action of inhaling. Many who practice Ashtanga-based sequencing experience this pose only for half a breath, as they move through it between chaturanga dandasana and downward-facing dog",

The abdominal muscles are quite active, particularly the transversus and obliques to stabilize the spine. The spinal extensors act to lift into the pose, and to maintain balance once there.

Hands and wrists alert: It’s very challenging to maintain the integrity of the hands with all the weight of the body balancing on them, but it’s essential in this pose, because collapsing into the wrist or heel of the hand is quite dangerous for the carpal tunnel and the nerves passing through it. Overuse of the gluteus maximus and latissimus dorsi can create more of a banana-shaped pose, which is admittedly easier for balance and may feel more stable for many people. Doing a handstand with a neutral spine is far more chal- lenging and recruits more core muscular strength. For hypermobile students, it is especially important to find the strength of deep, intrinsic muscles, so that the pose doesn’t become rigid, but is both stable and fluid . available for breathing. Breathing Handstand is one of the most difficult poses in which to breathe effectively. The combined action of the core supporting muscles, working to minimize shape change in the spine, also minimizes the breath movements. Add to this the chal- lenges of balancing, inversion, and strong upper-body action, and breathing is likely to be relegated to an afterthought at best. Many people instinctively hold their breath in handstand, partly out of fear, but also because of a need to stabilize the movements of the spine. Of course, to maintain this balance for more than a few seconds, the breath must be integrated into the pose—not necessarily as deep, full breaths, but as quick, efficient breaths that don’t disrupt the balancing or stabilizing actions of the core musculature",

    "content": "Obstacles and Notes This pose is a variation of parsva bakasana (addressed later in this chapter). It requires the same action in the spine, although the spine is often slightly more extended (toward neutral) in astavakrasana, which allows for a more even distri- bution of the rotation through the spine. In astavakrasana, the binding of the feet keeps the legs symmetrical. This symmetry in the legs and hip joints means that the rotation has to happen more in the spine and less in the hip joints. With the wrapping of the legs around the arm, less twist is needed than in parsva bakasana, because the bottom leg doesn’t have to reach quite as far. In parsva bakasana, the legs can release asym- metrically as the underneath leg slides forward, and the hip joints contribute to the rotational action of the spine. As in ardha matsyendrasana, if the spine does not rotate, potentially risky compensatory twisting can occur through abduction or adduction of the scapulae on the rib cage. Also, the wrapping of the legs around the arms creates a fairly stable pivot point. The challenge of this pose (if one can do parsva bakasana) is more about balance and flexibility than strength. The extended legs in this pose make the counterbalance on the support of the arms challenging. Breathing As compared to side crane, in which the body weight is lifted and supported on the upper arms, astavakrasana requires you to “hang” the weight of the lower body off the support of the upper arm. It’s interesting to examine which pose affords easier breathing",

Working Spine: Maintaining spinal flexion are the psoas major and minor, abdominal muscles, and pelvic floor. The deep intrinsic muscles in the posterior neck need to find cervical extension while maintaining thoracic flexion, which is a challenge because cervical extension tends to flatten the thoracic curve. Legs: The psoas and iliacus work to flex the hip joints. The pectineus, adduc- tor longus, and adductor brevis both adduct and flex the hip. The gracilis adducts and flexes the hip and knee, while the hamstrings maintain knee flexion. Arms: The infraspinatus and teres minor externally rotate the humerus; the subscapularis and supraspinatus protect the front of the shoulder joints. The anterior deltoids, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major and minor abduct and downwardly rotate the scapulae. The serratus anterior abducts the scapulae, and the triceps work against gravity to extend the elbow. The flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, and the intrinsic muscles of the hand, maintain the hand’s arches.

Obstacles and Notes In bird poses (eagle, crow, rooster, peacock), common factors are flexion of the thoracic spine, abduction of the scapulae, and extension of the cervical spine. In other words, wings are spread and the beak is lifted. These actions require precision and strength in the muscles of the spine to achieve cervical extension without engaging the trapezius, which will interfere with the action of the scapulae and arms. Breathing Because the thoracic region is maintained in flexion, breath movements in the rib cage are minimized in crane pose. The lower abdomen is also stabilized some- what by the deep abdominal and hip flexor action, but the upper abdomen is relatively free to move.

Because this is a bound pose, it can put a lot of force into the lower back when it is in a vulnerable position. That force comes not only from the knees on the arm, but also from the weight of the body. Breathing Similar as in bakasana, but even more restricted because of the twisting of the spine. 190 Mayurasana Peacock Pose ma-yur-AHS-anna mayura = peacock Classification and Level Advanced extended arm balance Joint Actions Cervical extension of the spine; mild thoracic flexion; mild lumbar extension; hip extension, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle plan- tarflexion; scapula downward rotation and abduction; glenohumeral joint external rotation, flexion, adduction; elbow flexion; forearm supination; wrist dorsiflexion.

    "content": "It’s unusual to balance on the arms with the forearms supinated. This changes the action in the wrist, because the extensors are more active to resist plantarflexion (falling into gravity). Breathing The pressure of the elbows into the abdomen stimulates the organs. Many ben- efits have traditionally been ascribed to this effect. All the abdominal muscles produce a strong isometric contraction to resist the pressure of the elbows into the viscera. Although no hip flexion is involved in peacock, the psoas muscle also works strongly from behind the peritoneum, to reduce the pressure on the ante- rior lumbar spine. So, the abdominal organs are being strongly squeezed from front and back—as well as from above and below—by the respiratory and pelvic diaphragms. Considering how much muscular energy is expended to maintain this pose, and the minimal amount of breathing it permits, it’s no wonder that it is rarely held for more than a few moments. The lungs in their limited capacity are simply unable to supply enough oxygen for that degree of muscular effort. A variation of mayurasana with legs in padmasana (lotus), is actually easier to maintain. This is due to the reduced muscular effort of stabilizing the lower body and the necessary repositioning of the elbows into the upper abdomen. This position takes less energy to stabilize than when the elbows press into the lower abdomen (which is the balance point when the legs are fully extended). 192 Pincha Mayurasana Feathered Peacock Pose pin-cha ma-yur-AHS-anna pincha = a feather of a tail mayura = peacock Rectus femoris Rectus abdominis Deltoid Triceps Hamstrings Gluteus maximus Psoas Serratus anterior Pronators Classification and Level Advanced inverted arm support Joint Actions Extension is maintained throughout spine: The more extension there is in the thoracic spine, the less there will have to be in the cervical and lumbar spines",

    "content": "This is a great preparation pose for handstand, because it strengthens the arms. If tightness in the forearm (either in the supinators or in the interosseus mem- brane between the radius and the ulna) restricts full pronation, the elbows will swing open or the hands will come together. This common forearm issue is often interpreted as tightness in the shoulders or weakness in the wrists. Shortness in the latissimus dorsi can also pull the elbows wide, by internally rotating the humerus. This can feel like tight shoulders, but can actually be addressed by side bending and other actions that lengthen the latissimus dorsi. Shortness in these muscles will also cause too much lumbar extension and inter- fere with breathing. Breathing The base of support for this pose is formed by the forearms, rib cage, and tho- racic spine, and these structures need to be quite stable to maintain balance. Because of this, excessive chest breathing interferes with supporting a forearm stand. On the other hand, the weight of the legs and pelvis and the curve of the lumbar spine need to be stabilized by the abdominal muscles, making too much abdominal movement counterproductive. Because of these factors, a breathing pattern that moves equally and smoothly throughout the body is needed. 194 Purvottanasana Upward Plank Pose POOR-vo-tan-AHS-ahna purva = front, east ut = intense tan = extend, stretch Classification and Level Basic backbending arm support Joint Actions Spinal extension; sacroiliac counternutation; hip extension, internal rota- tion, and adduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; toe extension; scapula adduction, downward rotation, elevation; glenohumeral joint extension, neutral rotation (some people need to internally rotate and some people need to externally rotate their humerus to maintain neutral alignment); elbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist extension; finger extension.

Gastrocnemius Hamstrings Psoas minor Spinal extensors Triceps Internal obliques Platysma 195 In the cervical spine, gravity creates the extension, and the anterior neck muscles (longus capitis, longus colli, and so forth) can work eccentrically to keep the forces in the neck balanced. In the thoracic spine, semispinalis thoracis, spinalis thoracis, the thoracic part of interspinalis, and the rota- tores are the most active. Legs: To extend the hips, the hamstrings should be primary, perhaps assisted by the extensor portion of the gluteus maximus. The adductor magnus creates internal rotation, extension, and adduction; the gracilis can help with adduction. The vastii and articularis genus work to extend the knees; the gastrocnemius and soleus plantarflex the ankle, while the intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles extend the toes. Arms: The teres major, posterior deltoids, and triceps work to extend the humerus, with the rhomboids and trapezius acting to maintain adduction. The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor) act to keep the humerus in neutral alignment. The triceps extend the elbows, while the pronators of the forearm and the intrinsic muscles of the hand distribute weight through the whole hand. This protects the heel of the hand from too much pressure. Lengthening Spine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, psoas major, sternocleidomastoid, supra- hyoid and infrahyoid muscles; psoas minor and obliques. Legs: Rectus femoris, iliacus, and psoas major.

    "content": "A problem with this, however, is that it brings in external rotation, which is harder on the lower back. The gluteus maxi- mus can also overdo the lumbar extension. If the hamstrings are too weak to do purvottanasana, then tabletop (chatus pada pitham, discussed later in this chapter) is a great preparation. The latissimus dorsi are not so helpful in this pose, because they can fix the scapulae on the rib cage and inhibit extension in the thoracic spine. Breathing It’s an interesting challenge to downwardly rotate the scapulae and still extend the spine. This is because depressing the scapulae tends to create flexion in the spine. The solution to this dilemma is to allow the breathing movements to mobilize the upper rib cage and sternum, which will deepen the extension in the upper back from the front line of the body. 196 Salamba Sirsasana Supported Headstand sah-LOM-bah shear-SHAHS-anna sa = with alamba = that on which one rests or leans, support sirsa = head Classification and Level Intermediate inverted arm support Vastus lateralis Rectus femoris Rectus abdominis Serratus anterior Triceps Hamstrings Spinal extensors Infraspinatus Deep neck muscles.

Weight Placement For some, the ideal placement of the weight on the skull is on the bregma—the juncture between the coronal and sagittal sutures, where the frontal bone meets the two parietal bones. This leads to a slightly more arched final position. Placing the weight more toward the crown of the head leads to a more neutral spine and more balanced action between the front and back of the body",

Supporting weight near the crown—lighter blue spot—leads to a more neutral spine position. (continued) Working Spine: The intrinsic muscles of the spine (intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius capitis and cervicis, longissimus, and iliocostalis) are all active to lift up into headstand, and to prevent falling down forward. Entering the pose demands work in the extensors of the thoracic spine, which may be unaccustomed to lifting the weight of the whole lower body. The psoas minor, obliques, rectus abdominis, and transversus are very active in the pose, to keep from falling backward. The pelvic diaphragm also is drawn into action along with the lower abdominal muscles, creating a strong mula bandha effect. 198 Neck: The rectus capitis anterior, rectus capitis posterior major and minor, obliquus capitis superior and inferior, longus capitis, and longus colli all work to balance the front and back of the atlanto-occipital joint and the atlanto-axial joint. Arms: Serratus anterior acts to wrap the scapulae; infraspinatus and teres minor externally rotate the arms; and supraspinatus and subscapularis help hold the head of the humerus in its socket. The triceps are active to stabi- lize the elbows as the extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris press the little finger side of the hands into the floor. Legs: The adductor magnus and hamstrings act to hold the legs together and extend the hip joints. The vastii extend the knees, and the medial fibers of gluteus maximus extend the hips (without external rotation). Obstacles and Notes Spine: Many people have asymmetries and slight rotations in their spines, which become more apparent in this pose. Note the rotational shifts, sco- liosis, and other asymmetries in the illustration of the author in sirsasana",

Salamba Sirsasana (continued) Semimembranosus Semitendinosus Biceps femoris Adductor magnus Gluteus maximus The author’s scoliosis is exaggerated in sirsasana. 199 Legs: It can be a challenge to find full hip extension in this pose. If the abdominal muscles are not strong enough, the hips can flex to keep the work of the pose in the back muscles instead of in the front. Note: Contrary to popular notions of increased blood or oxygen flow to the brain in inversions, it should be noted that the body has very robust mechanisms that control the amount of blood delivered to any given region—irrespective of the orientation to gravity. Regional changes in blood pressure have been observed based on inversion or compression of major blood vessels by body position, but this is a distinct issue from movement of blood volume and thus oxygen delivery. That said, inversions do offer a very beneficial opportunity for increased venous return from the lower body, as well as improved lymph drainage—not to mention the benefits derived from inverting the action of the diaphragm. Technique Even if you favor the “bregma” version of this pose, and enter into the pose with straight legs with the intention to end up in a more arched position, the strength and coordination required to maintain headstand safely demands certain skills that can be best developed by practicing the bent-leg entry into the pose. The key test is whether you can raise the weight off the feet without jumping, and maintain the difficult pose known as acunchanasana for several breaths. Breathing When the support for sirsasana is derived from the deeper intrinsic mus- cles of the spine, as well as the coordi- nated action of the hamstrings, vastii, psoas minor, internal obliques, transver- sus abdominis, and serratus anterior, the weight forces of the body will be more neutralized in gravity",

At that point, the inverted nature of the diaphragm’s action is emphasized because of the strong action of the abdominal muscles and pelvic diaphragm, which help to stabilize the center of gravity over the base of support.

    "content": "To deepen from pincha mayurasana into scorpion, the scapulae need to slide together on the back, which lowers the rib cage toward the floor and creates more mobility in the thoracic spine. The head then can lift and the thoracic spine can extend further. This also changes the balance point from between the shoul- ders to further caudal in the spine, made necessary by the bending of the knees. The lifting of the head is important to shifting the balance point; otherwise, the legs might overbalance the pose backward, causing you to fall into a back- bend. As the knees bend actively toward the head, the hamstrings are in the shortest working length. For this reason, they often cramp while trying to do this action. As important as getting into this pose is the ability to get out of it and find the relative neutrality of pincha mayurasana again. It’s a good idea to practice it in a manageable range—entering and exiting the pose with control. This is a good challenge because it gets muscles at maximum length to contract concentrically. Breathing Breathing in this pose is similar to breathing in pincha mayurasana, except that the abdominal breath movement is limited by the stretch of the muscles there, rather than by their stabilizing contraction. 202 Urdhva Dhanurasana Upward Bow Pose, Wheel Pose OORD-vah don-your-AHS-anna urdhva = upward dhanu = bow Deltoid Triceps Anconeus Pronators Rectus abdominis Psoas major Gluteus maximus Hamstrings Vastus lateralis 203 Classification and Level Intermediate inverted backbend Joint Actions Full-spine extension; sacroiliac counternutation; hip extension, internal rota- tion, adduction; knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula upward rota- tion, abduction (deepens into scapular adduction with more thoracic extension); glenohumeral flexion, external rotation, adduction; elbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist dorsiflexion",

Legs: The hamstrings work to extend the hips; the adductor magnus extends, internally rotates, and adducts the hips (the other adductors are less help- ful because they tend to pull the hips into flexion). The gluteus maximus helps to extend the hips, but too much gluteus action will also externally rotate the legs; vastii extend the knees. Arms: The infraspinatus, teres minor, and posterior deltoids create external rotation at the glenohumeral joint, and the subscapularis protects the front of the joint. The serratus anterior abducts the scapulae and elevates the arms; the deltoids flex the arms at the shoulders, and the triceps and anco- neus extend the elbows. The coracobrachialis flexes and adducts the arms at the shoulders. The pronators in the forearms turn the palms toward the floor. Lengthening Legs: Rectus femoris, psoas major, and iliacus. Torso: Abdominal muscles and anterior rib cage muscles, primarily internal intercostals and anterior neck muscles. Arms: Pectoralis major and minor, latissimus dorsi.

Most people instinctively use their quadriceps in a pushing action, which thrusts weight toward the head and arms, making it very difficult to raise the upper body off the floor. Initiating the lift of the pelvis with more of a “pulling” action resolves this difficulty. One of the challenges to accomplishing this is to use the hip extensors to sup- port the action in the legs, rather than the quadriceps as knee extensors",

    "content": "The strength of the hamstrings and adductor magnus can significantly decrease the work in the quadriceps. Of the adductor group, the adductor magnus is most useful for upward bow, because it creates hip extension and internal rotation along with adduction—all actions that support the alignment of the pose. The gluteus maximus is less useful for hip extension in this position, because it can create external rotation, which can lead to compression in the sacrum and lower-back pain. The arms need to move freely overhead, and a combination of mobilizing the scapulae and stabilizing the external rotation in the shoulder joints with the rota- tor cuff creates the necessary balance. If the latissimus dorsi are tight, they will restrict the ability of the scapulae to upwardly rotate. This can force excessive action into the spine or shoulder joints. Similarly, if there is restriction in hip extension, too much of the action can accumulate in the lumbar spine. Breathing Many students have been frustrated by their inability to take deep, full breaths in urdhva dhanurasana. The reason for this is simple: In this shape, the body is stabilized in a maximal inhalation, and there is very little one can do to expand further if attempting to inhale deeply. Quiet, relaxed breathing is preferable. The more efficient the muscle action in the pose is, the less oxygen you’ll need to fuel the effort",

Bottom arm: serratus anterior, to maintain neu- tral scapulae against the adduction force of gravity; infraspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the humerus; subscapularis and supraspinatus, to stabilize the head of the humerus in the glenoid fossa; deltoid, to help stabilize the head of the humerus in the glenoid fossa; triceps, to extend the elbow; pronators in the forearm; flexor carpi ulnaris and radialis; intrin- sic muscles of the hand to support the wrist and palm of the hand. Lengthening Latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis. Obstacles and Notes The challenge of this pose is not one of flexibility, but instead of how to maintain the neutral alignment of the spine and legs and the simple position of the arms against the action of gravity. The asymmetrical relationship to gravity means that muscles have to work asymmetrically to create a symmetrical alignment of the body—essentially tadasana turned on its side. There are many ways that gravity pulls the body out of tadasana in this pose: The spine may twist, the hips may fall forward or the shoulders may fall back (or vice versa), the bottom scapula and bottom leg may both adduct, and the pelvis may fall to the floor. It’s easy to overcompensate by lifting the hips too high, or to create lateral flexion of the spine in either direction, by either giving in to gravity or overresisting it. Overall, the side plank pose is very simple, but not very easy. Breathing From the standpoint of the breath, this pose has much in common with nira- lamba sarvangasana (unsupported shoulder stand). It is also a challenging bal- ance pose that requires a lot of stabilizing action in the abdominal and thoracic musculature",

    "content": "Side plank is a bit easier, because the arms can be used for support and balance, but deep breathing will still have the effect of destabilizing the pose.

Deltoid Triceps Anconeus Spinal extensors Gluteus maximus Hamstrings Quadriceps Rhomboids Gluteus minimus Biceps femoris Semitendinosus Semimembranosus Trapezius 209 Working Legs: The body weight in gravity wants to flex and abduct the hips, so the ham- strings and adductor magnus must maintain hip extension, adduction, and internal rotation. The gluteus maximus helps with hip extension but not so much that it will externally rotate the leg. The quadriceps are working eccen- trically, and the tibialis anterior is drawing the knees forward, over the feet. Arms: This is one of the few yoga poses that concentrically works the rhom- boids, which along with the middle trapezius, adduct the scapulae. The levator scapulae work to elevate the scapulae. The teres major, triceps, posterior deltoids, and latissimus dorsi work to extend the arms and down- wardly rotate the scapulae. The triceps extend the elbows; pronators in the forearms turn the hands toward the floor. Torso: The abdominal muscles (obliques and rectus abdominis) and the psoas minor work to resist lumbar hyperextension from gravity.

Arms: Pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis. Obstacles and Notes Weakness in the hamstrings makes it hard to create neutral extension of the hip joints, so many people use the quadriceps to extend the knee and push the foot into the floor. The problem here is that this tends to also create hip flexion, which obstructs the opening at the front of the hip joint. Overusing the gluteus maxi- mus will also externally rotate the hip, which the adductors will counter, creating even more restriction at the hip joint. Too much tightness in the pectoral region will prevent the scapulae from moving into position (adduction) and will result in either too much movement in the glenohumeral joint or flexion of the spine, which will challenge the breathing. If the chest is able to rise effectively in relation to the shoulder girdle, the base of the skull can (in most people) find a resting place on a “shelf” that’s formed by the upper trapezius muscles. This can provide a very nice release of the ante- rior neck structures without the risk of hyperextending the cervical spine (see a similar effect in ustrasana in chapter 6). Breathing Unlike urdhva dhanurasana (upward bow), tabletop pose is not an extreme backbend that restricts major respiratory movements. The combination of lifting action in the back body and release in the front body makes for an interesting opportunity to experiment by moving the breath around the abdominal and tho- racic regions. Some breathing patterns will have more of an effect on the stability of the pose, whereas others will assist in opening the upper rib cage.",

    "content": "C H A P T E r o n e OPTIMIZING HEALTH THE DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES (DRIS) We all need the same nutrients, but the amounts we need depend on our age, sex, and a few other factors. For exam- ple, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need more of most nutrients. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, a group of nutritional scientists from the United States and Canada, has established the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), a set of recommendations for nutrient intake. The DRIs are age- and sex-specific. With the exception of fats and carbohydrates (whose requirements depend only on our calorie needs), a separate DRI is set for each of the known nutrients for each of 10 different age groups. From the age of 9 years, males and females have separate DRIs, and additional DRIs are set for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How did the nutrient recom- mendations originate? Concerned with the need to provide proper nutrition for newly drafted World War II soldiers, many of whom were undernourished, the Department of Defense commissioned the first set of nutrient recommendations (called the Recommended Dietary Allowances) in 1941. Since then, nutrient recommendations W e are surrounded by a vast array of foods to eat and activities to pursue. Every day we make choices among those foods and activities based on our cultural background, knowledge, experiences, and goals. Each choice may have an impact on our overall health and qual- ity of life. Our ancestors’ food choices were limited by what they could gather, catch, cultivate, and harvest. Physical pursuits were determined by the work that needed to be done. Today, advances in agriculture, transportation, food preservation, and storage bring nearly every type of food from every country of the world to our local supermarkets through- out the year. With such a lim- itless array of foods, choosing the ones that promote health is easier than ever, but making these choices requires knowledge and motivation",

Today, nutrition research addresses not only the preven- tion of nutritional-deficiency diseases but also the role of nutrients in reducing the long-term risk for diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Taking into consideration the resulting expansion of scientific knowledge about the roles of nutrients in health since the first recommendations were established, the latest revision was begun in 1997. The new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) include the Recommended Dietary Allowance, the Estimated Average Requirement, the Adequate Intake, and the Upper Limit. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the amount of each nutrient that is sufficient to prevent nutri- tional deficiencies in practically all healthy people. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the amount of a nutrient that is estimated to meet the requirement of half the population of an age- and sex-specific group. For some nutrients, too little is known about them to establish an RDA. For these, an Adequate Intake (AI) is determined. This is the intake that should be adequate to meet the needs of most people. A safe Upper Limit (UL) has been established for some nutrients. Establishment of this value reflects our growing recognition that some nutrients may help promote health and prevent disease in amounts that exceed the RDA. The UL is the maximal daily intake of a nutrient that is likely to be free of the risk of adverse health effects in almost all individuals in the designated group. How are the DRIs used? They are the basis for all nutri- tional plans used by health care facilities and providers, food services, food manufacturers, and others who plan diets",

In addition, the Daily Values, the information on food labels that helps you determine how a food contributes to your total nutrient intake, are based on the DRIs (see the Appendix: Dietary Reference Intakes, page 421). AMERICA’S HEALTH GOALS According to recent statistics, our eating habits—the foods we eat and drink and those we avoid—play a major role in preventing 4 of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. These include heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes (see sidebar: Top 10 Causes of Death, this page). In addition, one in four adults has high blood pressure, a leading contributor to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and premature death. (See Chapter 3, page 47, for the important role of diet.) We didn’t always have this knowl- edge. But now that we do, experts in nutrition working with the federal government have provided us with nutri- tion and physical activity guidelines for staying healthy and preventing disease. Many government and health care associations focus their efforts on helping Americans eat well. Chief among them is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which created a set of national health goals entitled Healthy People 2010. Healthy People 2010 The ultimate goals of Healthy People 2010 are to improve the nation's health status and to eliminate health disparity among segments of the U.S. population.

TOP 10 CAUSES OF DEATH* (U.S. POPULATION) Many of the leading causes of death in the United States are directly related to diet and excessive alcohol consumption. habits. The primary means for achieving these goals is through various nutrition initiatives (see sidebar: Healthy People 2010, above). Mounting scientific evidence supports a link among diet, health promotion, and disease prevention. Improved nutrition has the potential to prevent or delay many diseases often associated with advancing age. With prevention of illness comes the possibility of reducing health care costs. Therefore, one of the main nutrition objectives is to promote health and reduce chronic diseases associated with diet and obesity. This includes reducing the number of people who die of heart disease, reducing the number of cancer deaths, reducing the prevalence of overweight and diabetes, and reducing growth retardation in children. To help achieve these health goals, specific nutrition targets were set. These include: • increasing the proportion of the population who are at a healthy weight • optimizing food and nutrient consumption, emphasiz- ing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains • improving nutrition and nutrition education at schools and at worksites • including nutrition counseling as a regular part of health care • increasing access to a healthful and safe food supply Coalitions of government health agencies and the food industry are working collaboratively to provide consistent messages that emphasize the importance of eating a diet rich in plant foods—fruits, vegetables, and grains—and containing less fat (see Other Voices, page 14)",

    "content": "5 a Day for Better Health The National Cancer Institute of the United States and the Produce for Better Health Foundation (a nonprofit consumer education foundation representing the fruit and vegetable industry) collaborated in a unique partnership in 1991 to develop the 5 a Day for Better Health program. This is a nationwide educational effort to encourage Americans to eat 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables every day for better health. A minimum of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day provides the RDA for many of the vitamins and minerals (see Chapter 2, page 29). The rec- ommendation that we eat 5 to 9 servings of fruits and veg- etables each day also is based on the results of numerous studies showing the positive effects of fruits and vegetables on health as a result of their ability to reduce the risk of can- cer and other diseases. Ample consumption of fruits and vegetables forms the basis of some of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the guidelines of the American Cancer Society and others, outlined below. The 5 a Day program works through state public health departments, retail food stores, school classrooms and cafeterias, the military, and various media. The goal of the program is to educate the public about the benefits of fruits and vegetables and to demonstrate easy and delicious ways to fit more of them into your diet (see Chapters 4 and 5, pages 79 through 149). Have We Made Progress? The explosion of health information and nutrition educa- tion programs has led to good progress on several fronts. Deaths from heart disease have declined and, to a slight degree, so have deaths from some cancers. On average, the intake of total fat and saturated fat has decreased. Food labeling provides much more useful information now. Restaurants offer more low-fat and low-calorie options on their menus. Although consumption of grain products is on the rise, many grains are in the form of snacks such as corn chips and popcorn",

Overall, fat intake is decreasing (from 40 percent of calories in the late 1970s to 33 percent in the mid-1990s). However, only about a third of adults meet the “30 percent or fewer calories from fat” recom- mendation of nutrition experts. Nutritionists are now assessing our progress in meeting the goals of Healthy People 2010. These efforts will include evaluating healthful behaviors in the areas of fitness and nutrition, ensuring a safe food supply, and reducing and pre- venting diseases such as osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Of course, national goals are met one person at a time. Fortunately, there is a road map for achieving fitness and health. Scientists and nutrition experts have mapped out a sound plan for healthful eating and exercise based on the most current findings about nutrition. THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS Aim for Fitness Aim for a healthful weight Research clearly shows that being overweight greatly increases your risk for many diseases, including heart dis- ease, cancer, and diabetes.

If you are at a healthy weight, your goal is to maintain that weight. Chapter 3 (page 47) provides further information on weight control. Be physically active each day Everyone—young and old—can improve their health by being more active. Choose activities that you enjoy and can do reg- ularly. Although you will gain more health benefits with high- intensity exercise that lasts 30 minutes or more, low-to-mod- erate activities can be part of your routine.

This could include using the elevator less and using the stairs more, parking farther from rather than closer to your destination, gardening, or golfing without a cart. For others, a more structured program might be preferred, such as at a worksite or health club. Whichever you choose, the goal is to include at least 30 minutes of activity every day. The need for regular physical activity is so important that the Surgeon General of the United States has issued a report entitled Physical Activity and Health, which has its own guidelines for achieving activity. They are the following: • Physical activity should be performed regularly. Include a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity (such as brisk walking) on most, if not all, days of the week. For most people, greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in activity that is more vigorous or of longer duration. • Previously sedentary people should start with short durations of moderate activities and gradually increase duration or intensity. • Physical activity should be supplemented with strength-enhancing exercises at least twice a week to improve musculoskeletal health, maintain independence in performing the activities of daily life, and reduce the risk of falling. • Consult with a physician before beginning a new physical activity program if you have—or are at risk for—a medical condition (such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes), or if you are a man older than 40 years or a woman older than 50.

Choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of sugars Some foods that contain natural sugar (such as fruits, vegetables, and milk products) also contain essential nutrients. Others, such as table sugar, sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages, candy, and some baked goods, supply calories but few other nutrients. When consuming sugar, moderation is key. (See Chapter 2, Carbohydrates, page 18.) Choose and prepare foods with less salt Sodium, a nutrient, is a major part of table salt (sodium chlo- ride). It is found naturally in many foods in small amounts. Salt and sodium compounds are also added to processed foods, and salt may be used in cooking or added at the table. Reducing sodium intake lowers high blood pressure in some individuals. Moderation in sodium intake is recom- mended. (See Chapter 3, High Blood Pressure, page 53.)

The Pyramid is designed to address the needs of all persons older than 2 years by providing a range of recommended servings for each food group (see sidebars: Sizing Up Your Servings, page 12, and How Many Servings Do You Need Each Day? page 13). The number of servings that you should choose from each food group depends on your calorie needs, which in turn depend on your age, size, sex, and activity level. The lower number of servings provides a total daily energy intake of about 1,600 calories. This calorie level meets the needs of most sedentary women and some older adults. The higher number of servings, which provides approximately 2,800 calories, is recommended for physically active men, teen boys, and some very active women. The middle range of servings is designed to provide about 2,200 calories, sufficient for children, teen girls, active women, and most men. These calorie estimates assume that you choose lean meats, lower-fat dairy foods, and vegetables and grains prepared and eaten with minimal added fat and sugar. In 1999, the USDA released a Children’s Pyramid. The Children’s Pyramid was designed to address the needs of 2- to 6-year-olds. It has proportionally smaller portions and numbers of recommended servings from each group of foods except fruits and vegetables. This emphasizes that children, too, need at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Similar to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the Food Guide Pyramid undergoes periodic updates to reflect what we have learned about the role of nutrition in disease prevention.

    "content": "Other Pyramids The risk for heart disease and some types of cancer among people who live in the Mediterranean region—southern Italy, France, Spain, and Greece—is significantly lower than the risk in Americans. Nutritional scientists have uncovered strong evidence that the eating, drinking, and exercise habits of the Mediterranean people play a major role in their low risk for disease. The Mediterranean diet has been illustrated as a “Mediterranean Pyramid,” based on our own Food Guide Pyramid. It is built on a foundation of pasta, bread, rice, and other grains, with large contribu- tions of vegetables and legumes (beans and peas) and small portions of meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products. The fat used in cooking and for dressings is olive oil, rather than butter. Desserts consist of fresh fruits, and meals are accompanied by wine. This plant-based diet is naturally low in saturated fat, higher in monounsaturated fats (from olive oil), and rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (see Chapter 2, page 33). In addition to adhering to a plant- based diet (which includes generous servings of legumes such as kidney beans, peas, and lentils), Mediterranean people have a more physically active lifestyle than most Americans. This factor also may contribute to their lower risk of heart disease. The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the USDA Food Guide Pyramid lies in the distinction between the recommendation to lower total fat, which places all high-fat foods at the tip of the Pyramid, and the Mediterranean practice of including monounsaturated fats but limiting saturated fats (see Chapter 2, page 26). You also may have heard of other Pyramids, such as a Vegetarian Pyramid and an Asian Pyramid. Like the Mediterranean Pyramid, these pyramids were constructed to illustrate dietary practices of groups whose risk of heart disease and some types of cancer is lower than that of people who consume a typical Western diet",

    "content": "Not surprisingly, these pyramids also illustrate diets that are plant-based and low in saturated fat. Still other pyramids are designed merely to showcase foods that are native to particular regions or pro- duced by particular companies. The Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight Pyramid and the California Pyramid, however, have one unique feature that we may see incorporated into a future Food Guide Pyramid, that is, the inclusion of fruits and veg- etables, rather than grains, as the foundation of the Pyramid. By replacing grains with fruits and vegetables at the base, the critical need to increase our intake of these foods is emphasized. OTHER VOICES: GUIDELINES OF HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS In addition to the Food Guide Pyramid and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, several private health organiza- tions (the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Institute for Cancer Research) have issued their own nutritional guidelines. When the guidelines of all the major health organizations are compared, they are similar. Recognizing this, experts from the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Chapter 1: Optimizing Health 15 Society, the American Dietetic Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, and the National Institutes of Health met in 1999 to review scientific evidence and to identify practices that are effective against major diseases. The dietary rec- ommendations that these groups have in common include: • Total fat: no more than 30% of calories • Saturated fat: less than 10% of calories • Monounsaturated fat: no more than 15% of calories • Polyunsaturated fat: no more than 15% of calories • Cholesterol: no more than 300 milligrams daily • Carbohydrates: 55% or more of calories • Salt (sodium chloride): less than 6 grams daily (4 grams of sodium) These recommendations can be achieved by following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (page 9) and by using the Food Guide Pyramid (page 11)",

Nutrition experts agree that when you lower the total fat, saturated fat, and added sugar in your diet and increase the vitamins, minerals, and fiber by eating more fruits, vegetables, and grains, you can improve your quality of life and help prevent many of the diseases that are the leading causes of death. Now that you know the goals and guidelines for healthful eating, we will provide you with the nutrition and food selection knowledge you need to put those guidelines into practice. Chapter 2 explains the nutrients we all need, the roles they play in promoting health, the best food sources for these nutrients, and how your nutritional needs change throughout your life. Chapter 3 describes how your risk for serious illnesses is influenced by your diet. Chapters 4 and 5 help you learn to use the Food Guide Pyramid to choose the most nutritious foods, and they give you guidance about planning and preparing healthful, appetizing meals.

    "content": "to get more complex carbohydrates, what do they mean and what foods contain those nutrients? In this chapter, we focus on the nutrients themselves—how they are digested, what happens to them in the body, and what they do for you. We also say a little about the best food sources of each nutri- ent, because, after all, when you go to the supermarket, you don’t look for protein, starch, fiber, and antioxidants, you look for chicken, rice, raisin bran, and orange juice. Nutrients are sorted into categories on the basis of their chemical structures and functions. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats contained in foods are known as the macronutrients, because they are required in the largest quantities. In addition to their other functions, macronutrients provide energy in the form of calories. Vitamins and minerals are known as the micronutrients. They are required by your body in much smaller quantities. Although the micronutri- ents help your body use the energy in macronutrients, they provide no energy (calories) themselves. Water is also an essential, calorie- free nutrient. The work our bodies do each day causes us to deplete some of our stores of these essential nutrients. Only by maintaining a diet that is rich in various nutrient-containing foods can we replace those lost nutrients. C H A P T E r t w o NUTRIENTS AND OTHER FOOD SUBSTANCES THE T here is no one perfect food. We need an assortment of nutrients that can be obtained only by eating a wide variety of foods. What is it that our bodies need? Scientists have identified more than 40 different nutrients in food. These substances are essential for growth and for the chemical reactions and processes that keep us alive and functioning (metabolism). Except for an extremely small number of foods that consist almost entirely of one nutrient, the vast majority of the foods we eat are mixtures of many nutrients",

    "content": "Nevertheless, each group of foods included in the Food Guide Pyramid (grains, fruits and vegetables, milk products, and meats) (see Chapter 1, page 11) is unique in the types of nutrients it contributes to our diets. For example, fruits and vegetables are the main source of many vitamins, minerals, and complex carbohydrates in our diets, and the meat group (includ- ing dry beans and legumes, eggs, poultry, and fish) is the main source of protein for most people. It can be difficult to understand the difference between the nutrients themselves and the foods that con- tain them. For example, when you hear nutrition experts talk about the need In addition to the known nutrients, substances in foods of plant origin, called phytochemicals or phytonutrients (phyto is the Greek word for plant), have been identified in recent studies. These phytochemicals may promote health and help prevent certain diseases. Hundreds of such compounds are being identified in the fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and grains we eat, although only a few have been thoroughly studied. How these various phytochem- icals influence our health is a promising new area of research for nutrition experts. THE MACRONUTRIENTS: CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, AND FATS Each of the macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—plays various roles in the function of our bodies. In addition to their unique functions, all of the macronutrients supply calories. When we eat more protein, carbohydrate, or fat than we need to replenish what we have used, the excess is converted to and stored as fat. Calories are used to support all muscular activity, to carry out the metabol- ic reactions that sustain the body, to maintain body temperature, and to support growth. But when we con- sistently take in more calories than we use, we gain weight. Weight is maintained when energy (calorie) intake balances energy output (see Chapter 3, page 48). CARBOHYDRATES The carbohydrates are a vast and diverse group of nutrients found in most foods",

    "content": "CARBOHYDRATES The carbohydrates are a vast and diverse group of nutrients found in most foods. This group includes simple sugars (like the sugar you add to your morning coffee) and complex forms such as starches (contained in pasta, bread, cereal, and in some fruits and vegetables), which are broken down during digestion to produce simple sugars. The main function of the simple sugars and starches in the foods we eat is to deliver calories for energy. The simple sugar glucose is required to satisfy the energy needs of the brain, whereas our muscles use glucose for short-term bouts of activity. The liver and muscles also convert small amounts of the sugar and starch that we eat into a storage form called glycogen. After a long workout, muscle glycogen stores must be replenished. Both simple sugars and starches provide about 4 calories per gram (a gram is about the weight of a paper clip). Because carbohydrates serve primarily as sources of calories (and we can get calories from other macronutrients), no specific requirement has been set for them (see Chapter 1, The Dietary Reference Intakes [DRIs], page 5). But health experts agree that we should obtain most of our calories (about 60 percent) from carbohydrates. Our individual requirements depend on age, sex, size, and activity level. In contrast to the other carbohydrates, fiber (a substance contained in bran, fruits, vegetables, and legumes) is a type of complex carbohydrate that cannot be readily digested by our bodies. Even though it isn’t digested, fiber is essential to our health. Nutrition professionals recommend 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily. Simple Sugars Simple sugars make foods sweet. They are small molecules found in many foods and in many forms. Some simple sugars occur naturally in foods. For example, fructose is the sugar that naturally gives some fruits their sweet flavor. Table sugar, the sugar that we spoon onto our cereal and add to the cookies we bake, also called sucrose, is the most familiar simple sugar",

    "content": "A ring-shaped molecule of sucrose actually consists of a molecule of fructose chemi- cally linked to a molecule of another simple sugar called glucose. Sugars such as fructose and glucose are known as monosaccharides, because of their single (mono) ring structure, whereas two-ringed sugars such as sucrose are known as disaccharides. Another disaccharide, lactose, the sugar that gives milk its slightly sweet taste, consists of glucose linked to yet another simple sugar called galactose. The inability to digest lactose to its constituent sugars is the cause of lactose intolerance, a condition common to adults of Asian, Mediterranean, and African ancestry. The table sugar that we purchase is processed from sugar cane or sugar beets. As an additive to many different types of prepared or processed foods, sucrose adds nutritive value (in the form of calories only), flavor, texture, and structure, while helping to retain moisture. Today, sucrose is most often used to sweeten (nondietetic) carbonated beverages and fruit drinks (other than juice), candy, pastries, cakes, cookies, and frozen desserts. One of the most com- monly consumed forms of sugar is called high-fructose corn syrup. High-fructose corn syrup is also commonly used to sweeten sodas, fruit drinks (not juices), some ice creams, and some manufactured pastries and cookies. Other forms of sucrose include brown sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado (raw) sugar. 18 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Foods that are high in added sugar are often low in essen- tial nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, these foods are often eaten in place of more nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and low-fat whole-grain products, and they may prevent us from obtaining essen- tial nutrients and lead to weight gain. Nutritionists are concerned by the enormous increase in sugar consumption by Americans during the past 30 years, particularly because much of this sugar is in the form of soft drinks",

    "content": "On average, teens today drink twice as much soda as milk, and young adults drink three times as much soda as milk. As a result, their intake of calcium-rich foods is low, a factor that is thought to contribute to lower bone mass. This can lead to an increased risk of bone problems as we grow older (see Chapter 3, Osteoporosis, page 67). The increase in sugar consumption also has been attrib- uted to the increasing availability of low-fat versions of such dessert and snack foods as cookies, cakes, and frozen desserts. Often, the sugar content of these foods is high because sugar is used to replace the flavor lost when the fat is decreased. Sugar promotes tooth decay, when consumed in forms that allow it to remain in contact with the teeth for extended periods (see sidebar: “Hidden” Sugar in Common Foods, this page). Thus, foods that are high in sugar, or sugar and fat, and have few other nutrients to offer appear at the top of the Food Guide Pyramid because they should be eaten sparingly. In contrast, choosing fresh fruits, which are naturally sweetened with their own fructose, or low-fat yogurt, which contains lactose (natural milk sugar), allows us to get the vitamins and minerals contained in those foods as well as other food components that contribute to health but may not have yet been identified. On the positive side, there is no credible evidence to demonstrate that sugar causes diabetes, attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder, depression, or hypoglycemia. No evidence has been found that sugar-containing foods are “addictive” in the true sense of the word, although many people report craving sweet foods, particularly those that are also high in fat. Complex Carbohydrates Found almost exclusively in foods of plant origin, complex carbohydrates are long chains of molecules of the simple sugar glucose. The complex carbohydrates in plant foods can be divided into two groups: starch and fiber. Starch is the form of carbohydrate that is found in grains, some fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds",

Fiber appears to sweep the digestive system free of unwanted substances that could promote cancer and to maintain regularity and prevent disorders of the digestive tract. Fiber also provides a sense of fullness that may help reduce overeating and unwanted weight gain. Diets that are rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates have been associated with lower serum cholesterol and a lower risk for high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and some types of cancer. But does this mean that it’s okay just to take a fiber pill? No! Rather, the studies that have shown the beneficial effects of a high- fiber diet (containing 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day) have been those in which the dietary fiber is in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and cereals.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see Chapter 1, page 8) recommend that we obtain most (about 60%) of our calories from carbohydrates, preferably complex carbohydrates, in the form of foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. These foods are good sources of fiber, essential vitamins, minerals, and other phytochemicals and are also more likely to be low in fat. The average American today consumes only about a third of the recommended amount of fiber. To obtain as many of the potential benefits as possible, you need to obtain complex carbohydrates and fiber from various food sources. Although studies indicate that our intake of carbohydrates is increasing, the contribution of whole-grain foods remains small, partly because identifying whole-grain foods can be confusing. For ideas on what whole-grain foods to look for in your supermarket, see the sidebars Where Are the Whole Grains? and Finding Fiber, this page. Foods that are naturally good sources of fiber or have fiber added are allowed to make claims on their labels regarding their fiber content. What do the terms used to describe fiber content mean? When you see the phrase “high fiber” on a food label, it means that 1 serving (defined on the Nutrition Facts panel) of the food contains 5 grams of fiber or more per serving. A food that contains 2.5 to 4.9 grams of fiber in a serving is allowed to call itself a “good source” of fiber, and a food label that says “more fiber” or “added fiber” has at least 2.5 grams more fiber per serving. Sugar Substitutes For the same reason that people have recently sought sub- stitutes for fat, noncaloric sugar substitutes became popular in the 1960s as people began to try to control their weight. Sugar substitutes are of two basic types: intense sweeteners and sugar alcohols",

WHERE ARE THE WHOLE GRAINS? Intense sweeteners are also called non-nutritive sweet- eners, because they are so much sweeter than sugar that the small amounts needed to sweeten foods contribute virtually no calories to the foods. These sweeteners also do not promote tooth decay. Currently, four such intense sweeteners are available, both for use in processed foods and for home consumption. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set “acceptable daily intakes” (ADI) for these sweeteners. The ADI is the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without risk. One of these sweeteners is aspartame (NutraSweet brand). It is manufactured by chemically modifying the naturally occurring amino acid phenylalanine",

This sweetener can’t be used by people with phenylketonuria (a rare congenital disorder that disrupts the body’s ability to metabolize phenyl- alanine and can result in severe nerve damage). Despite extensive safety testing showing aspartame to be safe, its use has been implicated by the popular press in everything from headaches to loss of attentiveness. At this time, there is no scientific validity to these claims. Aspartame is not heat stable, so it can’t be added to foods that will be cooked or baked, although it can be added to some foods (such as coffee) after heating. Saccharin, a second non-nutritive sweetener, was asso- ciated with cancer in mice when it was fed in very large amounts. However, further studies have found no links between saccharin and human cancer. This recently led the U.S. government to remove it from its list of potential cancer-causing chemicals. Although saccharin is heat stable, in some cases it cannot satisfactorily be used in baking because it lacks the bulk of sugar. Acesulfame K (Sunnett), a third intense sweetener, was approved by the FDA in 1998 for use in soft drinks, although it was used in various food products before that. About 200 times sweeter than sugar, this noncaloric prod- uct has been extensively tested for safety. After reviewing more than 90 studies, the FDA deemed the sweetener safe in amounts up to the equivalent of a 132-pound person consuming 143 pounds of sugar annually (an Acceptable Daily Intake of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight; 1 kilogram is about 2.2 pounds). Because it is not metab- olized, acesulfame K can be used safely by people with diabetes. The sweetener is more heat stable than aspartame, main- taining its structure and flavor at oven temperatures more than 390° Fahrenheit and under a wide range of storage conditions. Like saccharin and aspartame, acesulfame K lacks bulk, so its use in home baking requires recipe mod- ification",

A fourth intense sweetener, sucralose (Splenda), was approved by the FDA in 1998 for sale and use in com- mercial food products. Sucralose is made by chemically modifying sucrose (table sugar) to a non-nutritive, non- caloric powder that is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. Before approving sucralose, the FDA reviewed more than 110 research studies conducted in both human and animal subjects. It concluded that the sweetener is safe for consumption by adults, children, and pregnant and breast- feeding women in amounts equivalent to the consump- tion of about 48 pounds of sugar annually (an Acceptable Daily Intake of 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight). People with diabetes may also safely consume the sweetener, because it is not metabolized like sugar. In addition, sucralose is highly stable to heat and so will not lose its sweetness when used in recipes that require prolonged exposure to high temperatures (such as baking) or when stored for long periods. The product is currently available in the form of a powdered sugar substitute and in some commercial baked goods, jams and jellies, sweet sauces and syrups, pastry fillings, condiments, processed fruits, fruit juice drinks, and beverages, and its use is approved for various additional products. However, use of sucralose in home baking is expected to be limited by its low bulk in comparison with table sugar. Foods containing intense sweeteners should not be given to infants or children, who need energy to grow and to sustain their high activity levels. Foods that contain intense sweeteners and lack any nutritive value also should not replace nutrient-dense foods in your diet",

Unfortunately, excessive consumption can cause diarrhea or bloating in some people. So-called “natural” sweeteners provide the same number of calories as sugar and have acquired the reputation, albeit incorrectly, of being healthier than sugar, because they seem more natural than processed table sugar. These include honey, maple syrup and sugar, date sugar, molasses, and grape juice concentrate. In reality, these sweeteners contain no more vitamins or minerals than table sugar. Honey may harbor small amounts of the spores of the bacteria that produce botulism toxin and should never be given to babies younger than 1 year. The Bottom Line on Carbohydrates Carbohydrates—sugars and starches—are the main source of fuel for our bodies. When we choose carbohydrate-rich foods, our best bets are fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, because these foods are also rich sources of health-promoting vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber. But like all calories, extra calories from carbohy- drates beyond those we need to replenish the energy we burn are converted to fat and stored in our fat cells. Non-caloric sweeteners seem to be a safe alternative to sugar for most people, but the foods that contain them are often nutri- tionally empty and their use in home cooking is limited. The so-called natural sweeteners are no better for you than sugar. PROTEIN Protein is an essential part of our diets. Proteins are large, complex molecules resembling tangled strings of beads. Each of the “beads” on the string is one of a group of smaller molecules called amino acids. Amino acids are composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and some contain sulfur. Using the amino acids from the protein you eat, the body makes more than 50,000 different proteins",

These proteins are the main structural elements of our skin, hair, nails, cell membranes, muscles, and connective tissue. Collagen, the main protein in our skin, provides a barrier to the invasion of foreign substances. Proteins in cell mem- branes determine what substances can enter and exit cells. Our muscles, which contain some 65 percent of the body’s total protein, give our bodies their shape and strength. Proteins in connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and cartilage enable our skeletons to function, form inter- nal organs, and hold the organs in place. Proteins in the blood carry oxygen to all cells and remove carbon dioxide and other waste products. The proteins in muscle, connective tissue, and blood make up most of the protein in the body. Other proteins called enzymes accelerate meta- bolic processes, and still other proteins and amino acids are hormones and neurochemicals, the substances that deliver signals throughout the body and regulate all meta- bolic processes. During periods of growth, our bodies must manufac- ture and store large amounts of protein. Therefore, the requirement for protein in our diets is higher during growth. But even when we are not growing, each of the unique Chapter 2: The Nutrients and Other Food Substances 23 proteins in the body has a finite lifespan and must be replaced continuously. So the need for protein never ends. Dietary Protein and Body Protein The thousands of proteins that make up our bodies are assembled on demand from some 20 different amino acids. What are these amino acids, and where do they come from? The protein from the meat we ate last night is not directly incorporated into our muscles. The proteins in the foods we eat are digested first into small “peptides.” Some of these peptides are further digested into their constituent amino acids. Only amino acids and small peptides are actually absorbed by the small intestine into the blood- stream",

Of the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, 9 are considered “essential” because they cannot be made in our bodies and must be obtained from the foods we eat. Of the remaining 11, some are essential for infants and persons with certain diseases (see sidebar: Amino Acid Classification, page 25). The rest of the amino acids are considered “nonessential,” because our bodies can make them in adequate amounts, if necessary. Nevertheless, they are easily supplied by eat- ing a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of foods. Most foods contain protein. Some foods are better sources of protein than others. “Complete” proteins are those that contain all the essential amino acids in amounts needed to synthesize our body’s proteins. The best sources of complete protein are lean meats and poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and eggs (see Part II, High-Protein Foods, page 291, and Dairy Foods, page 345). 24 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Lean meats (including poultry and fish) and dairy products aren’t the only foods that contain protein. By eating a variety of foods, including grains and legumes, you are likely to meet your needs. The grains and cereals group of foods, which form the base of the Food Guide Pyramid, are excellent sources of protein, but because these proteins often lack one or more essential amino acids, they are called “incomplete” proteins. For example, the proteins in corn are low in the essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan, and wheat is low in lysine. In contrast, legumes tend to be rich in lysine but a bit low in methionine. Among the legumes, soybeans contain the most complete protein. Does this mean you must eat meat, eggs, and dairy products (foods of animal origin) to get all the amino acids you need? Not at all",

    "content": "By eating a variety of different foods, including grains and legumes, you are likely to get all the amino acids you need and in the correct amounts. People of many cultures and vegans (vegetarians who eat no foods of animal origin) get adequate amounts and types of protein by eating various combinations of plant proteins including beans, corn, rice, and other cereal grains. Although it was once thought necessary to combine these foods at the same meal, nutrition experts now agree that they can be eaten at various times throughout the day. When we eat grains and legumes, rather than foods of animal origin (a more frequent source of protein in our diets), we gain additional health benefits. Whole-grain foods and legumes are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other substances that optimize health. If that does not seem like reason enough to make the trade, grains and legumes lack the high levels of saturated fat present in foods of animal origin, which, as you will learn below, are linked to many diseases. Contrary to popular belief, simply eating more dietary protein, in excess of recommended amounts, will not result in bigger muscles. Our bodies do not store excess protein. If we eat more protein than our bodies need to replenish the amino acids we have used during the day, the excess amino acids are converted to, and stored as, fat. Dietary protein, like carbohydrates, supplies about 4 calories of energy per gram. Because our requirements for protein mainly depend on our body’s size, our need for protein increases during times of rapid growth. Therefore, the recommendations for protein are age-dependent and are slightly higher for preg- nant and breastfeeding women than for other adults (see the Appendix: Dietary Reference Intakes, page 421). The rec- ommended allowances ensure an adequate protein intake by nearly all healthy people",

Nevertheless, many Americans typically consume twice this amount, often in the form of meat and dairy products that are high in saturated fat, which increases the risk for coronary artery disease and some forms of cancer. What if we eat too little protein? Few Americans are at risk of eating too little protein. However, individuals on severely restricted diets, those who are unable to eat, and those whose needs are increased because of illness or trauma may experience protein deficiency. To replenish the pools of essential amino acids that have been depleted, in order to make critical proteins such as enzymes and hormones, the body of a protein-deficient person begins to rob protein from muscle by digesting that protein to its constituent amino acids. Because muscle is needed for various vital functions (for example, diaphragm muscles for breathing and heart muscles for pumping our blood), the loss of large amounts of muscle protein can be fatal. Fortunately, the vast majority of people, even those who engage in regular, rigorous endurance exercise, can easily meet their need for protein by eating a balanced diet based on the Food Guide Pyramid.

The Bottom Line on Protein Adequate protein is critical for growth, metabolism, and health, but eating more protein than we need will not build bigger muscles. Conversely, excess protein is converted to fat. Foods of animal origin are high in protein but may also be high in total and saturated fat. Lean meats and dairy products, fish, legumes, and grains are the best sources of protein. FATS It’s difficult to read a newspaper or listen to the evening news without hearing something new about fat and its connection with disease. Diets that are high in fat are strongly associated with an increased prevalence of obesity and an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and certain types of cancer. Health authorities recommend that we reduce our total fat intake to about 30 percent of total calories. They also recommend that we limit our intake of saturated fat (the type of fat most often found in meat and dairy products) to less than 10 percent of our fat calories and try to be sure that the fat we do eat is mostly the monounsaturated or polyunsaturated type. These changes have been shown to decrease our risk for several diseases. Fat as a Nutrient Fat is an essential nutrient, because our bodies require small amounts of several fatty acids from foods (the so-called essential fatty acids) to build cell membranes and to make several indispensable hormones, namely, the steroid hormones testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen, and the hormone-like prostaglandins. Dietary fats also permit one group of vitamins, the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), to be absorbed from foods during the process of digestion. Fats help these vitamins to be transported through the blood to their destinations. The fat in our bodies also provides protective insulation and shock absorp- tion for vital organs. As a macronutrient, fat is a source of energy (calories)",

    "content": "As a macronutrient, fat is a source of energy (calories). The fat in food supplies about 9 calories per gram, more than twice the number of calories as the same amount of protein or carbohydrate. As a result, high-fat foods are considered “calorie-dense” energy sources. Any dietary fat that is not used by the body for energy is stored in fat cells (adipocytes), the constituents of fat (adipose) tissue (see Chapter 3, Obesity, page 47). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that no more than 30 percent of our calories should come from fat, and only a third of that should be saturated fat. Sorting Out the Fats Our health is influenced by both the amount and the type of fat that we eat. Fats are molecules; they are classified according to the chemical structures of their component parts. But you don’t need to be a chemist to understand the connection between the various fats in foods and the effect these fats have on the risk for disease. Some definitions will help. Dietary fats, or triglycerides, are the fats in foods. They are molecules made of fatty acids (chain-like molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) linked in groups of three to a backbone called glycerol. When we eat foods that contain fat, the fatty acids are separated from their glycerol backbone during the process of digestion. Fatty acids are either saturated or unsaturated, terms that refer to the relative number of hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon chain. Fat in the foods that we eat is made up of mixtures of fatty acids—some fats may be mostly unsat- urated, whereas others are mostly saturated (see sidebar: A Comparison of Fats, page 27). Monounsaturated fatty acids are fatty acids that lack one pair of hydrogen atoms on their carbon chain. Foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids include canola, nut, and olive oils; they are liquid at room temperature",

    "content": "A diet that provides the primary source of fat as monounsatu- rated fat (frequently in the form of olive oil) and includes only small amounts of animal products has been linked to a lower risk of coronary artery disease. This type of diet is commonly eaten by people who live in the region sur- rounding the Mediterranean Sea (see Chapter 1, page 14). Polyunsaturated fatty acids lack two or more pairs of hydrogen atoms on their carbon chain. Safflower, sun- flower, sesame, corn, and soybean oil are among the sources of polyunsaturated fats (which are also liquid at room temperature). The essential fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acid, are polyunsaturated fats. Like monoun- saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats lower blood choles- terol levels and are an acceptable substitute for saturated fats in the diet. Saturated fatty acids, or saturated fats, consist of fatty acids that are “saturated” with hydrogen. These fats are found primarily in foods of animal origin—meat, poultry, dairy products, and eggs—and in coconut, palm, and 26 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition palm kernel oil (often called “tropical oils”). Foods that are high in saturated fats are firm at room temperature. Because a high intake of saturated fats increases your risk of coronary artery disease, nutrition experts recommend that less than 10 percent of your calories should come from sat- urated fats. To find out how to calculate your fat allowance, see the sidebar Recommended Fat Intake, page 28, and to determine the total and saturated fat contents of some foods, see the sidebar Where’s the Fat? page 28. Omega-3 fatty acids are a class of polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish (tuna, mackerel, and salmon, in particular) and some plant oils such as canola (rapeseed) oil. These fatty acids have made the news because of the observation that people who frequently eat fish appear to be at lower risk for coronary artery disease.

Hydrogenated fats are the result of a process in which unsaturated fats are treated to make them solid and more stable at room temperature. The hydrogenation process, which involves the addition of hydrogen atoms, actually results in a saturated fat. Trans-fatty acids are created by hydrogenation. An increase in consumption of these fats is a concern because they have been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Hydrogenated fat is a common ingredient in stick and tub margarine, commercial baked goods, snack foods, and other processed foods. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is a necessary constituent of cell membranes and serves as a precursor for bile acids (essential for digestion), vitamin D, and an important group of hormones (the steroid hormones). Our livers can make virtually all of the cholesterol needed for these essen- tial functions. Dietary cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin, that is, meat, poultry, milk, butter, cheese, and eggs. Foods of plant origin, that is, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, grains, and the oils derived from them, do not contain cholesterol. Eggs are the food most often associated with cholesterol, because the average large egg contains about 210 milligrams of cholesterol (only in the yolk), and the recommended daily cholesterol intake is 300 mg or less",

Fat Substitutes To appeal to our desire for lower-fat substitutes for our favorite high-fat foods, the commercial food industry has developed low- or lower-fat versions of many foods using various fat replacers. Until recently, fat replacers always consisted of proteins or carbohydrates, such as starches or gels, but the kinds of foods that could be prepared with these fat replacers were limited by their inability to withstand the high temperatures of frying. In 1996, after a long period of development, safety testing, and governmental review, the first non-caloric fat, olestra, was approved by the FDA for use in the manufacture of savory (non-sweet) snacks (such as crackers and chips). Because olestra is a modified fat, it is the first heat-resistant fat substitute, which allows it to be used to make fried foods. In addition, olestra gives foods the flavor and creamy “mouth feel” of high-fat foods. FDA approval of olestra was controversial for two reasons",

    "content": "Some scientists predicted that the substance would cause serious gastrointestinal complaints despite controlled studies demonstrating its safety. However, in the first year of availability of olestra- containing foods, the predicted intestinal problems were not significant. Tests in which volunteers ate large quantities of olestra-containing potato chips or regular potato chips without knowing which type they were eating showed no differences in gastrointestinal complaints between the two groups. Second, tests of olestra showed that it inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble compounds (vitamins A, D, E, and K and some carotenoids) from foods eaten at the same time as the olestra-containing foods, whereas it has no effect on the absorption of other nutrients or on the body’s stores of fat-soluble vitamins. To compensate for this effect of olestra on fat-soluble vitamin absorption, foods pre- pared with olestra have small amounts of these vitamins added to them. At this writing, the range of foods that can include olestra as a fat substitute is quite narrow. Some questions do remain about the long-term safety of the prod- uct, although long-term studies in young, growing animals and several studies in humans have shown no negative effects. How should you decide whether to include foods with fat replacers in your eating plan, and how much of these foods do you include? From a health standpoint, small amounts of olestra-containing foods appear to be harmless. But from a purely nutritional standpoint, most foods that contain fat replacers are snack foods essentially devoid of nutritional benefit. In addition, these foods are not calorie- free. Many remain high in calories, and some foods that contain carbohydrate fat replacers are even higher in calories than their higher-fat counterparts, so they are still calorie- dense, nutritionally poor foods",

This increased risk is the reason that health experts encourage us to reduce our intake of total and sat- urated fats by: • increasing our intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole- grain foods, which are naturally low in fat, and prepar- ing them with a minimum of added fats • consuming low-fat dairy products such as nonfat milk and yogurt and reduced-fat cheeses • limiting our intake of red meat, poultry, and fish to 5 to 7 ounces daily • choosing lean cuts of red meat and poultry, removing the skin before eating poultry, and preparing the meat with a method that uses little or no additional fats • choosing some fish that is high in omega-3 fatty acids and preparing it with little or no added fat THE MICRONUTRIENTS: VITAMINS AND MINERALS Vitamins and minerals are required by every process in your body. Unlike the macronutrients, vitamins and minerals by themselves do not contain energy. Instead, they work with the energy-rich macronutrients—carbohydrates, pro- tein, and fats—and with each other to help your body to release, use, and store the energy from those macronutrients.

Each of the vitamins was discovered and its require- ment determined by its ability to cure and prevent a particular disease or group of symptoms. For example, the discovery that a substance in limes could cure and prevent the disease called scurvy led to the discovery that our bodies require vitamin C and that scurvy is the result of vitamin C deficiency. Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are being established for each vitamin. They describe the amount of the vitamin that should prevent symptoms of deficiency in most people, with a little extra added. Today, the diseases that result from vitamin deficiencies rarely occur except in severely malnourished individuals or in those with certain medical conditions. Rather, in a virtual nutrition revolution, research has progressed beyond the identification and treatment of simple nutrient deficiencies to the realization that some of the vitamins (or foods that contain them) may help maintain health by preventing the development of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease in otherwise well-nourished people. The Food Guide Pyramid is based on the DRIs. It tells us the number of servings, in each group of foods, that will supply us with the recommended allowance of most of the vitamins",

This idea raises some questions. Is there such a thing as too much of a vitamin? Should these extra vitamins come from food, or is it okay to take a supplement if you just can’t eat that much? And, should the recom- mended amounts for these vitamins be increased? Although there really is no answer to the last question yet, the answers to the first two questions depend on the type of vitamin. As we begin our discussion of vitamins, we want to empha- size that although it is virtually impossible to overdose on vitamins from food alone, some vitamin supplements def- initely offer too much of a good thing (see sidebar: What Are Daily Values? this page, and Supplement Sense, page 38). The 14 essential vitamins can be classified into two groups: water-soluble and fat-soluble. They are classified on the basis of their molecular structure, which determines the way the vitamins are carried in food and in the blood- stream and the manner in which they are stored in your body. The text that follows describes which vitamins fall into which category and what that means for your health. Water-Soluble Vitamins There are 10 water-soluble vitamins. The B complex vitamins have various roles, some of which involve their action, in concert, to regulate the body’s use of energy from food. Folic acid is an important factor in the regulation of growth. During the early stages of pregnancy, folic acid is important for preventing a type of birth defect known as a neural tube defect. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, functions in various ways, many of which seem to be related to its antioxidant properties (see the Appendix: A Quick Look— Vitamins, Their Functions and Food Sources, page 430)",

Surplus water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine and through perspiration, because they are not stored in the body to any appreciable extent. Water-soluble vitamins must be replenished almost daily, preferably by eating foods that are rich in these vitamins. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans are excellent sources of the water-soluble vitamins (with the exception of vitamin B12, which is found only in foods of animal origin). However, if you choose to use 30 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Have you ever wondered what “% Daily Value” means on the Nutrition Facts label? How does it relate to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)? As you may recall from Chapter 1, the DRIs, set by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, are the amounts of each nutrient recommended for most healthy people. Because DRIs are both sex- and age-specific, each nutrient has a range of DRIs. To make it easier to show how a food meets your recommended allowance for some of the more critical nutrients, the Food and Drug Administration has established a Daily Value for each nutrient, which is approximately the highest recommended amount for that nutrient. The “% Daily Value” reported on the Nutrition Facts label is based on a maintenance calorie level of 2,000 calories daily. If your maintenance calorie level is 1,500 calories, your daily values may be a bit lower, so the nutrient contents of the food satisfy a higher percentage of your daily value. WHAT ARE DAILY VALUES? multivitamins or single-nutrient supplements to get your water-soluble vitamins, moderation is advised (see Supplement Sense, page 38), because high doses of several of the B vitamins can have harmful effects, and high doses of vitamin C may contribute to the formation of kidney stones",

    "content": "Fat-Soluble Vitamins The fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K, are found in the food you eat, absorbed into your bloodstream, and carried throughout your body attached to fat molecules. Because fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body, they do not need to be replenished on a daily basis. Vitamins A and D are stored in the liver, and reserve supplies may be sufficient for as long as 6 months. Reserves of vitamin K, however, may be sufficient for only a few weeks, and the supply of vitamin E can last somewhere between several days and several months. If taken in excess, usually in the form of a supplement, fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body. Large stores of vitamins A and D can actually become harmful. Fortunately, it is difficult to get an excess of fat-soluble vitamins from food. For example, beta-carotene, the molecule found in some foods of plant origin that gives carrots and squash their yellow-orange color, is converted to vitamin A in the body. But because the chemical reaction that converts beta-carotene to vitamin A is carefully regulated, it is nearly impossible to get vitamin A toxicity from eating fruits and vegetables. Foods that provide vitamins D, E, and K would need to be consumed in such quantity that achieving toxic levels of these nutrients is highly unlikely. However, a high intake of vitamin K- containing foods may contribute to abnormal bleeding in people who are receiving blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medication. Therefore, it is important to keep foods that are high in vitamin K relatively constant. Vitamin E supplements also are not recommended for these individuals. The recent development of diet drugs that work by inhibiting your body’s absorption of fat has raised concerns about the possibility that the use of such drugs could lead to deficiencies in the fat-soluble vitamins. Preliminary results suggest that when taken as directed, these drugs may interfere with the absorption of beta-carotene and vitamin D from foods",

    "content": "If these findings are confirmed, persons who take these prescribed drugs to manage their weight also will be required to take a daily multiple vitamin that contains the fat-soluble vitamin. As mentioned in the discussion of fat substitutes, early research on the fat substitute olestra showed that eating olestra-containing snack foods interferes with the body’s ability to absorb some of the fat-soluble vitamins from the other foods we eat. To compensate for this effect, the man- ufacturers of snack foods that contain olestra were required to fortify these products with fat-soluble vitamins. Thus, eating olestra-containing snack foods does not seem to cre- ate a significant risk for deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (unless you consistently choose to eat them in place of more nutritious foods). To learn about the many roles of vitamins, how much of each of them you need, and the best food sources for each one, see the Appendix: A Quick Look—Vitamins, Their Functions and Food Sources, page 430. Minerals Minerals are just what the term indicates—elements found in the earth. Like the vitamins, minerals play a multitude of roles in our bodies. Unlike the vitamins, some minerals— calcium and phosphorus—have a structural function. These minerals are the main components of our bones and teeth. Calcium has an additional critical role. Along with several other major minerals—sodium, chlorine, potassium, and magnesium—calcium is a regulator of cell function. The minerals sodium, chloride, and potassium (also referred to as electrolytes) are responsible for maintaining the balance of fluids inside and outside of cells and, along with calcium, controlling the movement of nerve impulses. Trace minerals are those that your body needs in smaller amounts, usually less than 20 milligrams daily. These include iron, chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc",

Although DRIs have been established for some of the trace minerals, those for which too little is known to establish precise DRIs have a recommended Adequate Intake (AI) (see the Appendix: A Quick Look—Minerals, Their Functions and Food Sources, page 432). Vitamins and Minerals as Antioxidants Several vitamins and minerals are considered antioxidants. These include vitamins E and C, beta-carotene (which can be converted to vitamin A), other carotenoids (some may be converted to vitamin A and also play a role in cell devel- Chapter 2: The Nutrients and Other Food Substances 31 opment), and the minerals selenium, copper, zinc, and manganese. What are antioxidants? What do they do? Every cell in our body needs oxygen to use the nutrients that food provides. However, when oxygen is used by cells, by-products called free radicals are formed. If allowed to accumulate, these free radicals can damage tissues, cells, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the genetic material of cells). The process of oxidative damage can be observed as the browning that occurs when sliced apples or potatoes are exposed to the air or the rancid flavor that butter and cooking oils develop when stored for long periods. Environmental pollutants such as cigarette smoke and ultraviolet light from the sun also contribute to the for- mation of free radicals in our bodies. Although not proved, studies suggest that excess free-radical production can increase the risk of cancer, heart disease, cataracts, and the other types of cell deterioration that are associated with aging. Just as the vitamin C in lemon juice can prevent sliced apples from browning, antioxidants scavenge and neutralize the effects of free radicals in our bodies. Each antioxidant has its own unique effect",

Fruits, vegetables, and grains provide a wide variety of both known and yet to be discovered antioxidants that appear to protect your body’s vital functions. WATER As an essential nutrient, water is the most often overlooked and taken for granted. Yet 75 percent of our body weight is water. Water contributes to nearly every major process in our bodies. It keeps our body temperature stable, main- tains body chemicals at their proper concentrations, carries nutrients and oxygen to cells, and removes waste products. Water also cushions joints and protects organs and tissues",

An insufficient intake of water or excessive loss of water can result in dehydration and heat exhaustion, a condi- tion characterized by dizziness, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and confusion. Fortunately, under most circum- stances our bodies are good at telling us when we are nearing dehydration. When we feel thirsty, our bodies need water. However, as we get older, our bodies’ ability to sense dehy- dration decreases, and older adults often lose the sense of thirst. Our need for water increases with exercise; exposure to hot or even warm, dry, or extremely cold conditions; pregnancy and breastfeeding; and the use of some medications. Nutritionists recommend that we drink 8 or more 8-ounce glasses of water daily. Many fruits and vegetables are 80 to 90 percent water. Therefore, in addition to the vitamins and minerals they supply, fruits and vegetables also contribute to our total water intake. For more information on water, see Part II, Encyclopedia of Foods, page 150. ON THE NUTRIENT HORIZON: PHYTOCHEMICALS Carotenoids. Isoflavones. Capsaicins. You may have heard these words in radio advertisements for the latest supplement or seen them in last week’s newspaper. But what are they? All of them fall into the category of substances called phyto- chemicals or phytonutrients. A phytochemical is, literally, any chemical found in a plant (phyto is the Greek word for Chapter 2: The Nutrients and Other Food Substances 33 When oxygen is used by cells, by- products called free radicals are naturally formed. Free radicals are molecules with a missing electron. Simply put, free radicals “want” their full share of electrons. They will take electrons from vital cell structures, causing damage and leading to disease. Antioxidants are able to donate electrons. Nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, or beta- carotene are antioxidants that block some of this damage by donating electrons to stabilize and neutralize the harmful effects of free radicals",

Armed with the knowledge that people whose diets are rich in foods of plant origin are at lower risk for many serious diseases, nutritional scientists have begun to try to isolate the actual chemicals in foods that may be responsible for promoting health and preventing disease. Nutritionists have adopted the term “phytochemical” or “phytonutrient” to refer to any one of a growing list of substances they have isolated that appear to prevent disease in laboratory animals. The phytochemicals identified so far are known to have various roles in the plants from which they originate, including capturing the energy from sunlight and confer- ring resistance to infection by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. How they function in our bodies, and how they may be responsible (along with the known vitamins, minerals, and fiber found in plant foods) for the health-promoting effects, is just beginning to be understood. The antioxidant beta-carotene is one of a group of phy- tochemicals known as carotenoids. Beta-carotene, the substance that gives carrots their orange color and their name, is converted to vitamin A (retinol) in our body. Other carotenoids include lutein and zeaxanthin (from green vegetables) and lycopene (from tomatoes). Diets rich in foods containing carotenoids have been associated with a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease. Researchers are also investigating whether lutein-rich diets may be linked to a lower risk for macular degeneration, a disease of the retina that may lead to blindness. The isoflavones found in soybeans are associated with lower blood cholesterol and a decreased risk for coronary artery disease. In addition, isoflavones, which are also referred to as phytoestrogens (estrogen-like molecules iso- lated from plants), appear to reduce some of the symp- toms of menopause and may confer a lower risk for breast and other cancers (see sidebar: Soy What? this page)",

Although some phytochemicals are now available in pill form, we do not yet know enough about how they function to assume that any one, on its own, will promote health and prevent disease without the presence of the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other, as yet unidentified, substances in plant foods. Scientists are making progress in determining how phytochemicals work, but the best way to ensure an adequate intake of all potentially health- promoting substances in foods of plant origin is to eat the foods themselves—fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. See the Appendix: Phytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484. SUPPLEMENTS: FOODS, OR FUNCTIONAL FOODS? Supplements are concentrated forms of vitamins, minerals, fiber, amino acids, fatty acids, herbal products, enzymes, plant or animal tissue extracts, or hormones. Some sup- plements contain one or two known nutrients or a small group of nutrients such as B vitamins or antioxidants. There is increasing evidence that isoflavones, plant estro- gens found in soy foods, may have some of the same effects as estrogen. Beneficial effects may include: • Lower blood lipid levels—Soy may decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. • Decreased cancer risk—Cancer population studies show a decreased risk for hormone-related cancers of the breast, ovary, endometrium, and prostate in countries where plant-based diets with a high content of phytoestrogens are consumed. • Diminished menopausal symptoms—Population studies show that women who eat soy as their main protein source may have far fewer distressing menopausal symptoms",

When we build our diet on a foun- dation of whole foods, we reap the added benefit of phytochemicals (known and unknown) and all the types of fiber we have begun to realize are important for health. Dietary supplements can be enticing. However, because of a law passed in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is more limited in what it can do to regulate the safety, purity, and labeling of supplements than what it does for drugs or even foods. Supplement manufacturers are required to list the ingredients of their products but are not accountable for the validity of those lists. Supplements may contain more or less of the active ingredient than they claim or may contain various impurities. Moreover, manufacturers are not required to list possible side effects of supplements on labels or in promotional materials (see sidebar: A Closer Look: Supplements and the Law, this page). Finally, we don’t yet know the active ingredient or ingredients in many herbal supplements and plant foods, so we have no way of knowing whether the commercially available extracts of those herbs or foods will have the same benefits as the foods themselves. Herbal Supplements The popularity of herbal products, those made from extracts of plants and believed to have medicinal properties, continues to increase.

Because herbal products are considered dietary supple- ments rather than drugs, the FDA is limited in its ability to regulate these substances. Ongoing studies continue to investigate selected herbs for their safety and effectiveness, so that more information will be available to consumers in the future. There is no guarantee of quality control. In the meantime, follow these precautions when considering a supplement: • Do not use herbal remedies for treatment of serious illnesses. • Do not give herbal (or other) supplements to infants and children. • Avoid all herbal supplements if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. When a dietary supplement is available in the store, it is naturally assumed that it is safe. Some government agency has checked to make certain it is not harmful, right? Not anymore. In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act removed dietary supplements from pre- market safety evaluations required of food ingredients and drugs. Drugs and food ingredients still undergo a lengthy Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety review before they can be marketed, but the 1994 legis- lation eliminated the FDA’s authority to regulate the safety of nutritional supplements before they go on the market. Now, the FDA can intervene only after an ill- ness or injury occurs. Claims may not be made about the use of dietary supplements to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure a spe- cific disease.

Those that contain more than 100 percent of your estimated daily needs may result in serious nutrient imbalances or even toxicity.

Protein or amino acid powders provide no benefit and are a poor substitute for protein-rich foods that contain necessary vitamins and minerals. Similarly, pills that promise to deliver all the fiber we need daily are a bad risk, because these pills invari- ably provide only one type of fiber, whereas each type of fiber found in foods of plant origin appears to confer unique health-promoting benefits. The fatty acids we need also are available in more than adequate amounts in various foods. Who Needs a Vitamin or Mineral Supplement? Eating a variety of foods, especially those of plant origin, allows most of us to acquire all the known nutrients, food substances, and as yet unidentified nutrients that our bodies need. Nevertheless, supplements may be appropriate for some individuals. Who are these people? • Pregnant or breastfeeding women have an increased need for most vitamins and minerals. Folic acid is espe- cially important early in pregnancy. Women who are capable of becoming pregnant should ensure that their daily intake of folic acid from supplements and fortified foods is 400 micrograms. These vitamins and minerals are contained in the prenatal supplements that are prescribed by your health care provider. • Older adults may absorb some nutrients poorly, partic- ularly folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. They there- fore may require supplements. • People on restricted diets may require supplements of some vitamins and minerals. • People with diseases of the digestive tract or other serious illnesses that limit their absorption of some vitamins and minerals may require supplements. • People taking prescription medications may have altered needs for a variety of nutrients. • Smokers appear to have an increased need for antioxi- dants, especially vitamin C",

Supplements do not replace the hundreds of nutrients in whole foods needed for a balanced diet, and they will not fix poor eating habits. If you are considering taking a supplement, heed the following: • Do not self-prescribe. • See your doctor or health care provider if you have a health problem. • Discuss any supplement that you are taking. Supplements may interfere with medications. • Read the label. Supplements can lose their potency over time, so check the expiration date on the label. Also, look for the initials \"USP.\" They stand for the testing organization, US Pharmacopeia, which estab- lishes testing standards for compounds. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not analyze supplements before they enter the marketplace. • Stick to the Daily Value (DV). Choose supplements that are limited to 100 percent or less. Take no more than what is recommended by your doctor or health care provider. The toxic levels are not known for some nutrients. • Do not waste dollars. Synthetic supplements are the same as so-called natural types. Generic and synthetic brands are less expensive and equally effective. • Store in a safe place. Iron supplements are the most common cause of poisoning deaths among children. USING SUPPLEMENTS • Vegetarians who eat no animal products may not get adequate vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.

As the fastest growing category of new food products, these are foods or food components to which manufacturers have added ingredients that are known or believed to promote health and prevent disease (see Chapter 4, What Do the Terms “Fortified” and “Enriched” Mean? page 92). Although the name “func- tional foods” is new, the concept is not: when it was dis- covered in the early part of the 20th century that some thyroid disease was caused by a deficiency of the mineral iodine, manufacturers began enriching table salt with iodine. Since that time, we have also seen vitamin D-for- tified milk, breakfast cereals fortified with a variety of vit- amins and minerals, and the addition of preservatives that are themselves antioxidants to almost all processed foods (see Chapter 3, Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine, page 66). The past few years, though, have seen a virtual explo- sion of functional foods, some based on careful research and supported by nutrition experts and some with question- able, if any, potential benefits. The Bottom Line on Supplements With a few exceptions, most of us should get all the vitamins, minerals, fiber, essential fatty acids, protein, and phytochemicals we need from the food we eat, rather than from supplements. Always consult your health care provider before trying a supplement. A few of the func- tional foods that have recently appeared on the market have proven benefits, although most have yet to demonstrate their value",

Using the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Food Guide Pyramid as standards for your food choices and amounts, you will be well on your way to establishing healthful eating habits for your entire life. Unfortunately, many people become discouraged by nutrition advice because they mis- takenly think they cannot eat their favorite foods. A more positive and encouraging approach is to consider that no food is forbidden. Good health comes from eating a variety of foods—meats, dairy products, and especially Chapter 2: The Nutrients and Other Food Substances 39 vegetables, fruits, and grains—in sensible amounts. Keep in mind that your sex, age, weight, and health status are also important considerations when it comes to determining your nutritional needs and maintaining good health throughout life. In other words, what is nutritionally right for one person may not be the same for you. In the following pages, you will explore several natural transition points during a lifetime which prompt variances in nutritional needs",

    "content": "These specific times of life, from infancy to preschooler, school-age to adolescence and teen years, to young and then older adulthood, are important to understanding the changes you can expect as you age and the strategies needed to meet your need for specific nutri- ents and optimal health. Infancy No human being grows more rapidly than an infant. On average, a baby triples his or her weight during the first year and grows taller by 50 percent. A newborn may grow from 7 pounds to 14 pounds in just 6 months, then to 20 or 21 pounds by the end of the first full year. It is easy to understand why proper nourishment for infants can pro- vide a healthy head start on life. Breast milk contains just the right balance of nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. It also provides the infant with antibodies to fight some common childhood illnesses, and it may be unique in that it decreases the risk of food allergies. Breast milk is also easy for the baby to digest. Mothers who cannot or choose not to breastfeed can still provide good nourishment to their infants with bottle feed- ing of commercial formulas. Careful preparation is required for each feeding, and formulas must be stored safely. As a baby becomes more hungry, it is best to increase the frequency of the breast- or bottle-feedings. Most nutri- tion experts recommend that solid food should not be started until after the fourth month. Many suggest wait- ing until your baby is at least 6 months old. Although babies may be ready for solid foods in a few weeks or months, the decision to start giving solid foods should be based on a baby's daytime behavior and eating habits and coordinated with a baby's increasing nutritional needs. Even if solid foods are started, breast milk or formula should continue to be included in a baby’s diet for at least 1 year. A baby's first solid food will probably be cereal",

Cereal is a versatile food because it can be mixed very thin for babies just starting on solid foods and can be thickened as babies work on chewing and swallowing. After cereals, fruits and vegetables are easiest for babies to digest. From 9 months on, babies make a gradual transition into toddlerhood and develop a feeding schedule that mim- ics the family’s mealtimes. Sometime after 12 months, babies may be on a schedule of three meals a day with the family and breast milk, formula, or snacks between meals. By 1 year of age, babies may have as many as four to six teeth and be developing a more defined and stronger chew- ing motion. With these developments, babies can handle foods of thicker consistency, such as lumpy or chopped foods. Continue offering new solid foods at the rate of one new food a week. One of the most important con- siderations at this age is offering baby food in a form that is appropriate to the baby's development. Any solid food should be tender and soft enough to be easily squashed with your fingers. The typical meal for a 1-year-old includes 1 tablespoon from each of the major food groups: milk, meat, vegetables, fruits, breads, and cereal grains. That menu may translate into a tablespoon of cooked carrots, two bites of rice, a taste 40 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Breastfeeding provides the right balance of nutrients—and more. of meat, and a couple bites of pear.

    "content": "Because a child is not growing at the same rate as during infancy, he or she may not want the same quantities of food that were once enjoyed. Some preschoolers may be uninterested in eating, whereas others seem finicky. Sometimes preschoolers are reluctant to try new foods or expand their food reper- toire beyond three or four favorites. There are several things you can do to help overcome these challenges without forc- ing a child to eat (see sidebar: Tips for Feeding Toddlers, page 42). By this time, a child should be eating foods from each of the food groups represented in the Food Guide Pyramid. However, do not expect a preschooler to eat a completely balanced diet every day. When allowed to choose from a selection of nutritionally sound foods, most children tend to select diets that, over several days, offer the necessary balance. Until age 2, fat should not be limited in a child's diet. Dietary fat and cholesterol are important for an infant's growth. After age 2, children can begin to consume fats in moderation just as the rest of the family does. This type of diet includes grain foods, vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, and their substitutes. Keep in mind that every child's energy needs are different. Thus, snacks are often appropriate for children, especially for smaller preschoolers who cannot eat enough to satisfy their energy needs all at once. Small amounts of various foods eaten frequently over the course of the day as a snack are healthful and normal. However, completely uncon- trolled snacking can diminish a child's appetite for meals",

    "content": "As children approach their teen years, boys and girls differ distinctly in growth patterns. Puberty generally begins about age 10 in girls and age 12 in boys and normally lasts for 2 to 3 years. During these years, growth spurts occur. It is during the school-age years that the guidance of parents is especially important to formulating good nutri- tion habits. Modeling healthful eating practices such as eating foods that are low in fat and high in complex car- bohydrates and fiber is important. Emphasize breakfast as an important meal. Pack healthful lunches that include fruit, vegetables, bread or some other form of starch, a meat or other protein, and low-fat milk. If a child partic- ipates in the school lunch program, talk about how to make nutritious food choices. Provide fruits, vegetables, whole- grain breads, or low-fat yogurts as after-school snacks. If a child participates in vigorous physical activity, more calories may be needed. One of the major challenges for some school-age chil- dren is controlling weight. If a child eats more calories than are used, the pounds will add up, particularly if the child is inactive. Besides the social and emotional stresses that may result from peers who make fun of a child's excess weight, a higher than desirable weight at this age can increase the risk for later health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and increased blood cholesterol or triglyceride values. Still, overweight children have the same nutrient needs as other children. The goal should be to stop or slow the rate of weight gain and allow height (growth) to catch up. Do not allow a child to restrict certain foods or to try fad diets. Instead, provide healthful foods in lesser amounts. The best way to teach a child about good nutrition is to set a good example in your own eating habits. 42 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition • Make it comfortable for a child to eat—comfortably seated, foot support, finger foods. • Develop a routine—schedule regular meals and snacks",

Foods with color and crunch are interesting—and fun—for youngsters. TIPS FOR FEEDING TODDLERS Teenage Years: Ages 13 to 19 The teen years and the arrival of puberty are the second period of remarkable growth for youngsters. It is a period of profound development that has important nutritional implications. As a result, requirements increase for energy and all nutrients. The growth and energy requirements of the teen years nudge daily calorie needs upward. On average, boys 11 to 14 years old need to have approximately 2,500 calories per day. From age 15 to 18, daily calorie requirements increase to 2,800 calories. Teenage girls also require more calories, but in the neighborhood of 2,200 calories a day. Most of the calories a teenager consumes should take the form of the complex carbohydrates found at the bottom of the Food Guide Pyramid. It is also a good idea for teens to have 3 servings of calcium-rich foods a day (milk, yogurt, cheese, certain vegetables) to make certain that needs are met for growing bones. Iron is also important to the expand- ing volume of blood in the body and for increasing muscle mass. Teenage girls can be at risk for a shortage of iron as a result of iron loss through menstruation. To ensure ample dietary iron, encourage teens to eat fish, poultry (especially dark meat), red meat, eggs, legumes, potatoes, broccoli, rice, and iron-enriched grain products. Growing, active teenagers have a real need to snack between meals. Encourage healthful snacks such as fresh fruits and raw vegetables, low-fat yogurt, low-fat milk, whole-grain bread, popcorn, pretzels, and cereals",

    "content": "Several factors challenge the ability of teenagers to eat well. The typical teen has a busy school schedule, extracur- ricular activities, and often part-time employment. These may lead to skipping breakfast and other meals in favor of more meals from vending machines and fast-food restau- rants, and more snacking on convenience items. For example, adolescence is an especially important time to get adequate calcium. Inadequate calcium may make teens more prone to the development of osteoporosis and other diseases in the future. When weight gain accompanies these habits, many teenagers turn to fad diets for quick weight loss. All of these pressures may lead to nutritional excesses, deficiencies, and, at the extreme, eating disorders. Excessive weight concerns can have more serious impli- cations. Extremes in eating patterns, either severe under- eating or excessive overeating, may result in serious—even life-threatening—health risks. These extremes may impair some bodily functions, including decreased hormone pro- duction, and thereby slow sexual maturation in both girls and boys. Consult a health care professional if an adoles- cent has a problem with weight. Adulthood The adult body is dynamic, changing subtly as the years march by. Therefore, what was a good diet for you in your second or third decade of life may no longer be a good fit at age 50 or 60. For example, your metabolism—the way in which your body converts the food you eat into energy—slows. This means that you gradually need less food for a similar activity level. Fewer and fewer calories are needed as you grow older—about 10 percent less per decade from age 50 onward. This slowing of the metabolism is perfectly nat- ural and occurs because you lose muscle mass (which utilizes most of the energy you produce) as you age. Exercise helps to maintain muscle mass and helps you burn calories. However, most Americans still need to reduce calories. Variety and moderation remain the keys to a healthful diet",

Moderation controls calories and is especially important with regard to consumption of alcohol. Drinking plenty of water, eating fiber-rich foods, and staying as active as possible can help to stave off constipation. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding The best time to start thinking about good nutrition is before a woman becomes pregnant. Then she can be certain that her baby will have all the essential nutrients from the moment of conception. Babies born at low weights (less than 5.5 pounds) have a greater likelihood for development of health problems. Mothers-to-be can help prevent this from occurring by eating the well-rounded diet that women their age would ideally eat, as well as achieving an appropriate weight for their height. Women who are 15 percent or more under- weight present a special risk for a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. Before becoming pregnant, talk to your health care provider about your need for a folic acid (a B vitamin) supplement. Doctors and scientists agree that use of folic acid supplements can reduce the occurrence of a birth defect called a neural tube defect. One form of this defect is spina bifida, an incomplete closure of the spine. Folate levels also may be affected by consuming alcohol and Chapter 2: The Nutrients and Other Food Substances 43 “Morning” sickness “Morning” sickness is not necessarily unique to mornings.

Even with the increased need for calories, it is nearly impossible to get sufficient amounts of iron, which is needed in double the amounts recommended for non- pregnant women. The added iron is needed for the expand- ed blood volume that accommodates the changes in your body during pregnancy. Iron is also needed for the formation of tissue for both your baby and the placenta. At birth, a newborn needs enough stored iron to last for the first 6 months of life.

Senior Years Maintaining a healthful diet into older adulthood can be a challenge, particularly if part of what makes eating a pleasurable experience—the senses of taste and smell— decline. Tooth loss or mouth pain can further complicate the act of eating. The medicines that must be taken to treat chronic diseases may affect appetite, when meals are eaten, and, in some cases, how food tastes. Other life changes, including the loss of a spouse, fewer social contacts, economic hardships, and increasing depen- dence on others for day-to-day care, combine to make getting a healthful diet more difficult, but more impor- tant than ever. As people become older, they can expect to need fewer calories than they did when they were younger—about 10 percent less per decade from age 50 onward. Persons age 70 should be eating about 80 percent of the calories they were eating 20 years earlier. Nonetheless, older people con- tinue to need other nutrients in the same quantities as ever. This decline in calorie intake translates into a need for food that is rich in nutrients, to provide what you used to get with more calories when you were younger. Keeping a lower-calorie intake in mind, you can simply follow the basics of the Food Guide Pyramid as you get older: heavy on the grain foods, fruits, and vegetables; adequate meats and dairy products; light on the fats, oils, and sweets. Watch for signs of poor nutrition in older adults and consult a physician, registered dietitian, or other health care professional to address their nutritional needs and to determine whether supplementation with vitamins is needed.

In this chapter, you will read about the importance of nutrition in maintaining or improving your health. Whether you are healthy, have a medical problem, have a family history of one, or know a family member or friend with an illness, nutrition plays a major role in prevention and treatment of common diseases. K nowing what nutrients comprise a well-balanced diet, in what foods to find them, and in what quantities to eat them are some of the first steps to good health. Applying this knowledge by eating nutrient-rich foods and incor- porating physical activity into your schedule at any stage of life are the greatest investments you can make in sustain- ing good health. Although healthful eating may lower your risk for certain diseases, there are no guarantees that adhering to the tenets of good nutrition will prevent an illness from developing. Science has shown that not all diseases or disorders are asso- ciated with what you eat. However, statistics do show that lifelong food selections may influence the risk for some diseases. Research continues to evaluate and clarify the role that diet and nutri- tion play in the promotion of health and in the development of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and other illnesses. The nutritional recommendations for prevention of many diseases are similar (see Chapter 1). In this chapter you will learn about selected conditions in which nutrition plays an important role and how proper nutrition may affect and even alter the course of these conditions.

It is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, lipid abnormalities, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers (such as breast, colon, and gallbladder in women and colon and prostate in men), stroke, degenerative arthritis, respiratory problems, sleep disturbances, and gallbladder disease. Obesity places a huge burden on society in terms of lost lives, ongoing illnesses, emotional pain, discrimination, and economic cost (nearly $100 billion annually). The most ominous burdens posed by being overweight are reduction of the quality of life and shortening of life span. The likeli- hood of dying early (compared with the average age at death of all people in the population) progressively increases the more overweight you are. Diseases caused by obesity are the second leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. C H A P T E r t h r e e FOOD-HEALTH CONNECTION THE The Battle of the Bulge With countless diet programs and products promising to help you shed pounds, losing weight should be easy. Simply eating too much and not being active enough are the causes of most overweight problems. But you also know it is hard to lose weight and even harder to keep it off. The cause of overweight and obesity is a chronic imbalance of calories ingested and calories burned. Genetic and environmental factors also contribute to obesity. Americans spend more than $33 billion a year on weight-loss products and services, but they are losing the “battle of the bulge.” Despite the great desire of Americans to be thinner, they have become more obese. Some have even declared that the United States has an “obesity epi- demic.” It is estimated that more than 50 percent of adult Americans are overweight.

    "content": "“Overweight” refers to having excess body weight com- pared with the norm for a person’s height, but the term does not account for what tissue is making up the weight. For example, athletes are often overweight according to weight-for-height tables because they have increased muscle mass. However, for most people, overweight means having too much fat. “Obesity” refers to body fat in excess of what is healthful for an individual. In healthy women, an acceptable level of body fat ranges from 25 to 35 percent. In contrast, an acceptable range of body fat in men is from 10 to 23 percent. How Your Body Uses Food The number of calories used by an individual is deter- mined by three factors: basal metabolic rate, the thermic effect of the food eaten, and the calories used during phys- ical activity. The basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy needed to maintain bodily functions when an indi- vidual is at rest. This component accounts for 60 to 75 per- cent of the daily calorie requirement in sedentary adults. The major determinant of the basal metabolic rate is the amount of fat-free mass in the body. Muscle is one example of fat-free mass. Resistance (strength) training can increase the amount of muscle and therefore increase the basal meta- bolic rate. Resistance training also can help prevent the loss of lean mass that normally occurs with aging. Men tend to have more muscle than women and therefore burn more calories. The thermic effect of food is the energy required to digest, metabolize, and store nutrients. The thermic effect of food accounts for about 10 percent of the total daily calorie use. The number of calories burned during exercise can vary tremendously depending on the amount of exercise performed. For most so-called sedentary persons, the activi- ties of daily living (such as walking, talking, and sitting) account for 15 to 20 percent of the daily calorie use",

    "content": "Should You Lose Weight? How do you determine whether you are overweight or obese? Scientists can use sophisticated tests to measure body composition. However, these are not necessary for most individuals. You can measure your change in weight over time. Alternatively, you can calculate your body mass index (BMI) and determine its relationship to health risks. Pinpointing Your Risk There are risk factors that indicate a predisposition for obesity. Among these risk factors are the following: Body mass index (BMI)—BMI is defined as your weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of your height (in meters). Simpler still, look it up in the Body Mass Index Table on page 49. The advantage of BMI over bathroom scales and weight-for-height tables is that it normalizes weight for height and helps determine whether you have a healthful or unhealthful percentage of total body fat. People who should not use the BMI for determining health risks include competitive athletes and body builders. Their BMI will be high because they have a larger amount of muscle. BMI is also not predictive of health risks for growing children, women who are pregnant or lactating, and frail, sedentary older adults. A BMI from 19 to 24.9 is associated with a minimal to low health risk. A BMI from 25 to 29.9 is considered over- weight and is associated with moderate health risks. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese and is associated with a substantially greater risk for development of various diseases. Extreme obesity is a BMI of more than 40. Body shape—Increasing attention has been focused on the distribution of body fat as a potential indicator of health risk. Specifically, excess fat in the abdomen is asso- ciated with an increased risk for development of various metabolic illnesses, including diabetes mellitus, increased blood lipid levels, and high blood pressure.

    "content": "What Is There to Lose? To Gain? Although no one is without health risk—even the fittest person can have a heart attack, diabetes, or cancer—health and well-being are apt to be in less jeopardy if BMI, body shape, and family health history do not indicate problems. However, if your BMI is 25 or more, if your fat is primarily located in your upper body, and if you have a personal or family history of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or sleep apnea, losing weight can greatly improve your health. Keep in mind that BMI and waist circumference are just starting points. Other factors also are important. When in doubt, seek a medical evaluation by your physician. A thorough history, examination, and blood studies can clarify whether your weight is having adverse effects on your health. The appropriate plan of action then can be tailored to meet your individual needs. 50 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Measuring your waist circumference can be helpful to determine how your body distributes fat. Fat in your abdomen increases your risk for high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, stroke, and certain cancers. The body has a nearly unlimited capacity to store fat. Excess fat in the abdomen can lead to illnesses, includ- ing diabetes, high blood lipid levels, and high blood pressure. It is also associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Losing weight will reduce these risks and lessen the strain on the lower back, hips, and knees. Getting Started Losing body fat and keeping it off are not easy. Losing weight and then maintaining a healthful weight require collaboration with knowledgeable health care professionals. Obesity is not only a medical issue but also is a lifestyle issue. Your habits can help you maintain a desirable body weight or they can hamper your efforts to lose weight or even cause you to gain further weight",

Therefore, experts recommend that any weight loss program should consist of three main components: nutrition, exercise (or activity), and behavior modification. (See sidebars: Weight Management Programs: Look for These Criteria, and Special Situations, this page.) Nutrition Liquid meals, over-the-counter diet pills, and special combi- nations of foods promising to “burn” fat are not the answers to long-term weight control and better health. Learning to eat differently—to enjoy a well-balanced diet of fewer calories— is the best strategy to achieve health and weight goals. You should begin by substituting the words “healthful nutrition program” for “diet.” Most people try to lose weight by eating 1,000 to 1,500 calories a day. In many instances, eating fewer than 1,400 calories makes it difficult to eat a balanced diet containing the recommended levels of nutrients. Therefore, nutrition programs that are too low in calories may be hazardous to your health. You can lose weight by eating fewer calories or by increasing exercise. A caloric deficit of 3,500 calories is required to lose 1 pound of fat. Over 7 days, this can be Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 51 WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS: LOOK FOR THESE CRITERIA Nearly 8 million Americans enroll in some kind of structured weight-loss program each year. Choose a safe and helpful program that meets these criteria. • Physician participation—Consult a doctor if you have a health problem or it is necessary to lose more than 15 to 20 pounds. • Qualified staff—Registered dietitians can design a nutrition plan. Specialists in behavior modification and exercise are also recommended. • Nutritionally balanced diet—Any weight management plan should ensure adequate nutrition. • Exercise—At a minimum, there should be instructions for starting a safe exercise program. • Reasonable weight loss goals—Weight loss should be slow and steady",

A loss of 10 percent of starting weight is also a reasonable initial goal. • Help in changing lifestyle—Programs should help improve life-long eating and exercise habits. There should be opportunity for follow-up support—even after goals are reached. • The only way to lose weight and keep weight off is to combine a healthful nutrition program (“diet”) with regular physical activity. Prescription medications for weight loss may be considered in moderately overweight or obese people with weight-related health problems. Use of these medications does not eliminate the need for healthful nutrition and activity or behavior modification strategies. Medical supervision is essential because there are potential risks, in addition to benefits. • Weight-loss surgery may be considered only in clinically severe obesity (BMI of more than 35) with weight-related medical problems or in extreme obesity (BMI more than 40). • Over-the-counter diet products are a huge financial success.

However, these effects can be dangerous, and any weight loss isalmost always temporary. achieved by cutting 500 calories each day from your usual food intake or by cutting 250 calories each day (such as one or two fewer cookies) and burning an additional 250 calories with exercise (such as by walking briskly for 30 SPECIAL SITUATIONS minutes). The good news is that a relatively small loss of weight can make a big difference in reducing the risk of health complications from obesity. Even a 10 percent weight loss can lead to improvement in your blood sugar level, lipid values, and blood pressure.

    "content": "Rather than aiming for an “ideal” weight, which may not be achievable or desirable, focus on achieving and maintaining a healthful weight. A healthful diet for controlling weight includes foods from all food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid—ensuring balance and variety—in sensible amounts (see Chapter 1, Food Guide Pyramid, page 11. Also see Chapters 4 and 5 for planning and preparing healthful meals). It is helpful to review the energy density of the food consumed. Fat con- tains 9 calories/gram, protein 4 calories/gram, and carbo- hydrates 4 calories/gram. Alcohol contributes 7 calories/gram. For most people, the volume of food consumed deter- mines how full you feel. Therefore, eating a small amount of an energy-dense food (such as fat) is usually not filling, whereas eating a large enough amount to fill you up results in a very large calorie intake. To lose weight, decrease your total calories by cutting back on the fat while filling up on low-calorie high-nutrient foods such as vegetables, fruits, and grains. You also can eat lower-fat versions of foods. However, be careful, because low-fat is not always low- calorie (see sidebar: Low-Fat Is Not Necessarily Low-Calorie, this page). Healthful eating habits also avoid the feast or famine phenomenon. Distributing food selections throughout the day provides nourishment to support daily activities and can help to eliminate energy highs and lows. Three meals and occasional snacks also keep one’s appetite in check. It is also important to avoid the hazards of repeatedly losing and gaining weight. Although repeated dieting is still a matter of debate, some studies suggest that it may lower the rate at which calories are burned. When a person is off the diet and more food is eaten, the body stores fat faster and more efficiently. This effect causes regain of the lost weight. In this circumstance, the amount of weight regained often is more than that lost in the first place",

Physical Activity Improved eating habits in combination with decreased calorie intake and calorie-burning exercise is the best way to lose weight and maintain the results. In addition to enhancing weight loss efforts, physical activity promotes loss of body fat, increases muscle mass, and increases cardio- vascular fitness. Regular exercise not only helps you lose weight by increasing the number of calories you burn but also makes it easier to keep off the weight that you have already lost. Walking is a good choice for getting started on an exercise plan. A daily 2-mile walk burns approximately 1,000 to 1,200 calories per week. In addition, do not dis- count the physical activity that is part of ordinary activities of daily living—housework, climbing stairs, gardening— all important forms of exercise that can contribute to weight loss.

An exercise stress test may be helpful because it can measure the response of the heart to exercise and help establish a safe starting level. (See Chapter 1, pages 8 to 10, for further discussion about the benefits of exercise.) Behavior Modification Behavior modification programs help identify triggers and treatments for unhealthful eating habits—such as uncon- trolled snacking or late night eating. Such programs often explore the reasons behind an inactive lifestyle. Food diaries and activity logs frequently are used to heighten your aware- ness of what and how much is eaten and the type and amount of exercise done daily. These journals often provide insight into what triggers undesirable eating and what can be done to avoid or change this behavior. Other key behavioral elements needed for success include: Commitment—There must be personal motivation to change—to eat healthfully and to get regular physical activity. Priorities—It takes significant mental and physical energy to change deeply ingrained habits. If other major issues or life stresses are present, it is important to seek help for dealing with them. When balance in life is regained, you can focus on healthful nutrition more effectively. Realistic goals—The best goals are those that can be achieved. Set daily or weekly goals that allow progress to be measured and rewarded. Aim to lose about 1 to 2 pounds weekly. It is important to know that small losses of weight— or improvements in physical activity—can improve health.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common major health condition in the United States. It is one of the leading causes of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death. It also can damage parts of the circulatory system—including blood vessels in the heart, brain, eyes, and kidneys. Sometimes called the “silent killer,” high blood pressure is a disease that can go undetected for years. The higher the blood pressure or the longer it goes undiagnosed, the worse the outlook. More than 50 million Americans have high blood pressure. Of that number, an estimated one-third do not know they have the disease. There has been remarkable progress in detecting, treating, and controlling high blood pressure. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the number of individuals who are aware of their high blood pressure and who are being treated for it. At the same time, the incidences of coronary artery disease and stroke have significantly decreased, partially as a result of progress in the detection, treatment, and control of high blood pressure. Despite these efforts, most people with high blood pressure do not have adequately controlled blood pressure. Unfortunately, high blood pressure remains a serious medical problem. Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 53 Physical activity enhances weight loss efforts by promoting loss of body fat, increasing muscle mass, and increasing cardiovascular fitness. Approximately 5 percent of cases of high blood pressure can be traced to underlying diseases, such as kidney disorders or conditions that cause narrowing of the arteries. This is called “secondary hypertension.” But most cases have no known cause. This type is called “primary” or “essential” hypertension",

Risk Factors for High Blood Pressure There are risk factors that indicate a predisposition for the development of high blood pressure. Among these risk factors are the following: Family history—A family history of high blood pressure is a risk for hypertension. Age—High blood pressure becomes more common among all people as they grow older. After all, nearly two- thirds of Americans aged 70 or older have the disease. Sex—Although men and women are typically equally affected, women who use birth control pills and smoke cigarettes have a greater chance of having high blood pressure. Race—As an example, high blood pressure is more common among blacks than whites. You either have or don’t have the above risk factors. There are also other factors that increase your risk for high blood pressure which you can do something about: • obesity—control your weight • lack of exercise—get moving • alcohol consumption—take control or abstain • excessive salt (sodium) intake—cut down Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the force that the blood exerts on the artery walls as the heart pumps it through the body. The amount of force depends on various factors, including how hard the heart pumps and the volume of blood it pumps. Another factor is the amount of resistance blood encoun- ters in the arteries—the thicker or more clogged the blood vessels, the greater the resistance. The elasticity of arteries also plays a role in blood pressure. The less elastic arteries are, the less they expand under the force of a heartbeat and the higher the resistance. The standard way to measure blood pressure is in mil- limeters of mercury (mm Hg). This unit of measurement refers to how high the pressure inside the arteries is able to raise a column of mercury. Each blood pressure measure- ment has two numbers. The top number is the systolic blood pressure, or the highest pressure within the arteries that occurs during “systole,” when the heart is contracting",

For most people, a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg or lower is considered healthy. Effects of High Blood Pressure Repeated blood pressure measurements that are more than 130/85 mm Hg indicate a potential for problems, a greater risk of progressing to definite high blood pressure, and the need to have regular blood pressure checks. A measurement of 140 systolic or more, 90 diastolic or more, or both indi- cates high blood pressure, which requires treatment. Recent guidelines stress the importance of treating to achieve a pressure less than 130/85. Indeed, treating to these lower levels of blood pressure further reduces the incidence of stroke, heart and kidney damage, and other vascular prob- lems. When high blood pressure occurs, it means that the force of the blood in the arteries is excessive and many health complications can occur (see illustration on page 55). Heart High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood to distant tissues and organs. Another way to understand blood pressure is to think of it as a weight or a load that the heart muscle must “push” against.

Bleeding within brain (stroke) Bleeding within eye (hemorrhage) Enlarged (hyper- trophied) heart Shrunken (ischemic) kidney Partially obstructed artery (ath- erosclerosis) Enlarged artery (aneurysm) weights. Eventually, the heart’s pumping efficiency decreas- es when the muscle can no longer adapt to the excessive workload that the high blood pressure demands. When this occurs, the heart muscle may weaken and the heart can fail. Arteries High blood pressure can also accelerate the development of plaque within the arteries, a condition known as athero- sclerosis. With the narrowing of the artery walls, the risk of heart attack is increased. High blood pressure also can lead to bulges (aneurysms) in the arteries. If an aneurysm in a major artery ruptures, the results can be catastrophic and possibly fatal. Brain High blood pressure increases the risk of having a stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel within the brain either ruptures or is blocked. Kidneys The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and main- tain proper blood minerals and blood volume. When these functions are impaired or compromised, so is their role in helping to maintain blood pressure. These effects can produce a destructive cycle that results in increasing blood pressure and a gradual failure of the kidneys to remove impurities from the blood.

Examination of the retina can reveal narrowing of the arteries, small hemorrhages, and accumulations of protein that have leaked from affected blood vessels (exudates).

Treating the high blood pressure is the only way to reverse this vision loss. Treating High Blood Pressure Fortunately for many people, high blood pressure is preventable. Even those who already have high blood pressure or are at increased risk may be able to reduce the number and doses of medications needed to control it and minimize other health complications by the following lifestyle modifications. or biking for 30 to 45 minutes most days of the week is a very effective means of lowering blood pressure. Limit alcohol—Excessive alcohol intake is a risk factor for high blood pressure and stroke. It also can interfere with the effects of blood pressure medications. Men who drink should limit their intake to no more than 2 drinks a day; women should have no more than 1 drink daily (see Chapter 4, A Drink Defined, page 87). Do not smoke—Smoking a cigarette temporarily increases blood pressure for up to 30 minutes. Smoking is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Everyone, especially people with high blood pressure, needs to quit smoking or never start. Limit or avoid high-sodium foods—A high intake of sodium in the diet increases blood pressure in some people. The average American consumes about 4,000 milligrams or more of sodium a day. People with high blood pressure should limit their sodium intake to less than 2,400 mil- ligrams a day, and many experts recommend the same limit for everyone",

THE COMBINATION DIET FROM THE DASH STUDY This eating plan is from the \"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\" (DASH) study from the National Institutes of Health. This diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy foods and low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. It is also high in potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Follow a balanced nutrition program—A low-fat, high- fruit and vegetable diet can lower blood pressure impres- sively, all by itself. A large percentage of people with high blood pressure may be able to decrease their need for blood pressure medication if they follow the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid. A diet following this plan promotes weight loss and is high in minerals such as calcium, potassi- um, and magnesium, which have been associated with lower blood pressure.

    "content": "Chapters 4 and 5 (pages 79 through 149) provide ideas for planning and preparing healthful meals. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recently sponsored a study testing the effects of different diets on blood pressure, called the “DASH” (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study. Participants in the study ate one of three diets: an average American diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a “combination” diet that empha- sized fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and was low in fat and saturated fat. Sodium consumption was the same in all three diets. Participants were asked to limit obviously salty food, to rinse canned vegetables, and to not add extra salt to food. Both the fruit-and-vegetable diet and the “combina- tion” diet lowered blood pressure. However, the combi- nation diet was the most effective. Within that group, people with above-normal blood pressure (more than 129/80 mm Hg) and those with high blood pressure (more than 140/90 mm Hg) experienced reductions of their blood pressure similar to those achieved with some blood pressure medications. Researchers believe that people following the combi- nation diet fared better because of the low saturated fat and high fruit and vegetable mixture that provided adequate potassium, magnesium, and calcium. For people with normal blood pressure, the combination diet may help to avoid blood pressure problems. If blood pressure is only slightly increased, following this diet may actually eliminate the need for medication. For people with severe high blood pressure, the diet may allow reduction in blood pressure medication (see sidebar: The Combination Diet From the DASH Study, page 56). When Medications Are Needed When lifestyle changes alone are not effective for lower- ing high blood pressure, medications may be required. Medications vary in the way they control blood pressure",

Some types help the kidneys to eliminate sodium and water, some make the heart beat more slowly and less forcefully, and others enable the blood vessels to relax and decrease the resistance to blood flow. Your physician will determine which drug or combination of drugs is best suited for you. DIABETES MELLITUS Each year, the words “you have diabetes” are spoken with greater frequency, often to unsuspecting individuals. Among Americans, the prevalence of diabetes has grown dramatically during the 20th century. Today, more than 16 million Americans have diabetes—90 percent of them are older than 40 years. Interestingly, half of these adults do not even know they have the disease because symptoms develop gradually and, at first, are hard to identify. Early diagnosis is important, though, because the longer diabetes goes untreated, the greater your risk for serious complications. What Is Diabetes? Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of metabolism—the way the body uses digested food for energy and growth. The origin of the name “diabetes mellitus” is Greek, referring to sweetness or honey (mellitus) that passes through (diabetes). After a meal, food is broken down into simpler forms and absorbed by the body. Simple sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids are used by the body or converted by the liver into sugar (glucose), the preferred fuel the body burns for energy. For cells to use this form of sugar, insulin—a hormone that is produced by the pancreas—must “unlock” the cells to allow glucose to enter. The pancreas, a long, thin organ that is about the size of a hand, is located behind the stomach. Normally the pancreas produces the right amount of insulin to accom- modate the amount of sugar that is in the blood. Diabetes is actually not a single condition but a group of diseases with one thing in common—a problem with insulin. In a person with diabetes, the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin to meet the body’s needs",

    "content": "In a person with diabetes, the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin to meet the body’s needs. This insuffi- ciency may develop if the pancreas stops producing the right amount and quality of insulin, if the rest of the body’s cells do not respond properly to insulin, or a combination of both. Insulin is required for glucose to be metabolized properly. If there is not enough insulin, excess glucose builds up in the blood, and the resulting condition is called hyperglycemia. Persistent hyperglycemia causes almost all the symptoms that may alert an individual to the development of diabetes. Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 57 These symptoms can include frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, recurrent infection, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands or feet, and hunger. With diabetes, the excess glucose spills into the urine, and the urine output increases. Consequently, the person with diabetes becomes dehydrated and thirsty. Fatigue results when the supply of glucose to cells is not available, causing energy levels to decline. To compensate for the lost fuel, the body burns stored fat, and weight loss and hunger may occur. Left untreated, persistent hyperglycemia is also responsible for most of the long-term complications of diabetes (see Long-Term Complications of Diabetes, this page). There are several types of diabetes—different disorders with different causes. The two most common types are described here. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes occurs in 1 in 10 people with diabetes. In these individuals, the pancreas produces little or no insulin. To control blood sugar, insulin must be taken. Most people whose diabetes is diagnosed before age 30 have the insulin- dependent type. It used to be called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile-onset diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects both sexes equally. In most cases it is due to an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas",

    "content": "This type of diabetes commonly develops in child- hood, but it can occur at any age. It can develop unnoticed for several years and then suddenly become apparent, often after an illness. Some people—particularly children and teenagers—may first become aware of the disease when they develop ketoacidosis. This is a serious complication in which the blood becomes more acidic because of severe insulin deficiency. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of diabetes in people older than 30. It was previously called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes. Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. For people with this type of diabetes, total absence of insulin is not the problem. The problem is that the body does not make enough insulin to meet its needs and the insulin does not work normally to control glucose levels. This is termed “insulin resistance” and leads to hyperglycemia. Excess weight is by far the greatest risk factor for devel- opment of type 2 diabetes. Most people who develop type 2 diabetes are overweight, a condition that appears to impair insulin action. Someone who is overweight and has diabetes may be able to achieve a normal blood sugar without medication simply by losing weight. Losing as little as 10 percent of body weight has been shown to lower blood glucose. Surprisingly, persons who are not overweight by traditional criteria also may be at risk for diabetes. Excess body fat distributed mostly in the abdomen increases the chance for development of type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors include age, race, heredity, and lack of physical activity. Type 2 diabetes may go undetected for many years, because hyperglycemia develops slowly and the disease may not immediately produce the classic symptoms of diabetes. Unfortunately, even without symptoms, there are hidden dangers, including damage to major organs such as the heart and kidneys",

    "content": "Because the disease usually develops after age 40, and the incidence increases more steeply after age 55, it is important that people in middle age be screened for the disease and see their physician if symptoms develop. Type 2 diabetes is more common among Native Americans, Hispanics, African-Americans, and western- ized Asians than among people of European ancestry. Long-Term Complications of Diabetes Numerous studies have shown that keeping the blood glucose level close to normal delays the onset and prevents the progression of eye, kidney, and nerve diseases caused by diabetes. Even if blood glucose has not been controlled in the past, any improvement in diabetes control may help to avoid or delay complications of diabetes and their progression. Treatment of high blood lipid values and high blood pressure, which are commonly associated with diabetes, is also important. Eye disease—In the absence of good glucose control, eye disease develops in nearly everyone with diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy occurs because high blood sugar (especially coupled with high blood pressure) can damage the small blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive area within the eye). Diabetes also can lead to cataracts, damage the macula (the area in the eye where the optic nerve is located), and increase the risk of glaucoma. In addition to keeping your glucose levels under control, it is important to have regular eye examinations with an ophthalmologist, who dilates the eyes and does a thorough 58 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition examination of them. A non-dilated eye test is not adequate for screening. Kidney failure—In the absence of good glucose control, a person with diabetes is 20 times more likely to develop kidney failure than someone who does not have the disease. Kidney disease results when chronic high blood sugar damages the small vessels in the kidneys which are responsible for filtering waste from the blood. Ultimately, kidney failure may occur, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant",

    "content": "Ultimately, kidney failure may occur, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. People with diabetes should have the function of their kidneys evaluated routinely. Nerve damage—Also called neuropathy, nerve damage occurs in 30 to 40 percent of people with diabetes. Nerve damage can cause numbness and tingling, pain, insensitivity to pain and temperature, and extreme sensitivity to touch. Experts think the damage results from the effect of chronic high blood sugar on blood vessels that supply nerve cells. The feet are especially vulnerable to neuropathy. Cardiovascular disease—Chronic high blood sugar is associated with narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. It is also associated with increased blood levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat) and decreased levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol. Unless appropriately treated, an individual with diabetes is 5 times more likely to have a stroke and 2 to 4 times more likely to have coronary artery disease. Also, smoking dramatically accelerates the development of these cardiovascular complications. Anyone with diabetes should stop smoking. Infections—High blood sugar impairs the function of immune cells and increases the risk of infections. The mouth, gums, lungs, skin, feet, bladder, and genital area are common sites of infection. Nerve damage in the legs and feet can make someone with diabetes less aware of injuries or infection, increasing the risk of amputation. With prop- er care of the feet, foot complications can be minimized or avoided. Can Diabetes Be Prevented? Although an area of active research, there is currently no proven means of preventing type 1 diabetes. However, these lifestyle changes minimize the risk of, and may actually prevent, type 2 diabetes: Maintain a healthful weight—Most people who develop type 2 diabetes are overweight. Aggressive efforts aimed at achieving and maintaining a healthful weight may be bene- ficial, especially in combination with exercise",

Exercise—People who exercise regularly have a signif- icantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes. Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 59 Blood sugar can be kept within normal levels by balancing the main treatment tools for diabetes—nutrition, weight control, exercise, and medication. In some people, blood sugar may be controlled by a combination of loss of excess weight, good nutrition, and regular exercise. Others may need medication. How Is Diabetes Diagnosed? It is important that diabetes be diagnosed early, before too much damage is done. As a first step, the American Diabetes Association recommends that everyone should visit a physician and get a fasting blood glucose test at age 45. A sample of blood is drawn after fasting overnight, and its glucose level is measured. A normal fasting result is between 70 and 110 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). A retest every 3 years is advised. If an individual has any risk factors for diabetes or any symptoms, testing at more frequent intervals or at an earlier age is recommended. Diabetes is diagnosed when a fasting blood glucose value is more than 125 mg/dL or a glucose value is more than 200 mg/dL accompanied by symptoms of diabetes. The diagnosis should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day. Tools for Controlling Diabetes Persons with diabetes can live a full life by following a few basic principles to control their disease. Diabetes can be managed with at-home blood glucose tests, healthy nutrition habits, weight control, routine exercise, and medications (if needed). The most important step is to learn to control the blood sugar value, which means maintaining it as near to normal as possible or in the goal range determined by your physician. Vigilant control of blood sugar levels may dramatically reduce the risk of eye, kidney, and nerve damage",

Blood sugar can be kept within normal levels by balancing the main treat ment tools for diabetes— nutrition, weight control, exercise, and medication. In some people, blood sugar may be controlled by a combination of weight loss, good nutrition, and regular exercise. Others may need medication. Blood Sugar Levels The level of glucose in the blood depends on several factors: when meals are eaten, how many calories are consumed, activity level, and the dose of medication prescribed. The stress of an illness may also alter the level of blood glucose. Successful daily management of diabetes may prevent or minimize emergencies that may result when blood sugar levels are too high or too low. Because these emergencies can cause mental confusion or loss of consciousness, people with diabetes should wear a medical alert identification and acquaint family members, friends, neighbors, and coworkers with the signs and symptoms of an emergency and steps to a proper response. Blood sugar levels can be monitored with home testing meters. Testing not only measures the amount of sugar in the blood but also enables the person to identify the reasons behind high and low values so that adjustments can be made in the dose of diabetes medications. Frequently the person can learn how to adjust the dose of oral medication or insulin to achieve the desired glucose value. The health care team caring for the person with diabetes can deter- mine reasonable blood sugar goals. Nutrition The old restrictive diets for diabetes no longer apply. It is now known that the best diet for diabetes control is consistent with what everyone should eat for good health. How much you eat is just as important as what you eat in controlling blood sugar. To keep blood sugar on an even keel, people with diabetes should not eat large meals or skip meals; they should eat smaller servings at regular intervals instead",

    "content": "As for the menu, choices should follow Food Guide Pyramid recommendations—emphasize whole grains, legumes, and vegetables. These foods are higher in complex carbohy- drate and fiber and can help control blood sugar. Even though fruit contains sugar, it should not be avoided. Because people with diabetes are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, it’s important to keep the fat intake to about 30 percent of total daily calories and to limit cholesterol-containing foods. Items at the top of the Food Guide Pyramid—such as fats and sweets—should be eaten sparingly. Research has shown that the total amount of carbohydrate consumed at a given time, rather than the type of carbohydrate, is the most important factor in control of blood sugar. Therefore, if not present in excess, sugar can be included as a part of a well-balanced meal. Many tools are available to help with meal planning. For most people, eating three meals at regular times and avoid- ing excessive sweets are enough to control blood sugar. Dietitians may provide a simple method, such as the Food Guide Pyramid, to encourage variety, proportion, and 60 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition moderation in food selections and to also ensure healthful food choices. Chapters 4 and 5 provide ideas for planning and preparing healthful meals. Other techniques may be needed and recommended by your physician, registered dietitian, or certified diabetes educator. Weight Control Because many people who have diabetes are overweight, maintaining a healthful weight and level of activity is the key to keeping the disease under control and minimizing the risk for serious complications. The more overweight people are, the more resistant their cells become to their own insulin; losing weight decreases that resistance. Often, weight loss of just 10 percent can improve blood sugar and have lasting beneficial effects.

Studies have shown that those at high risk for diabetes who exercise have a 50 percent lower incidence of type 2 diabetes. Exercise helps control weight, makes cells more sensitive to insulin, increases blood flow, and improves circulation in even the smallest blood vessels. A leaner body also helps burn calories more efficiently. Moreover, exercise lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease. Exercise can affect blood sugar levels up to 24 hours. So if insulin is a part of the treatment plan, check with a physician to receive guidelines for frequency of blood sugar testing and insulin adjustment. Medications Along with nutrition, weight control, and exercise, med- ications may be necessary to achieve a desired glucose level. Persons with type 1 diabetes must take insulin by injection. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because it breaks down in the digestive tract. The type of insulin and number of daily injections depend on individual needs. Insulin also can be administered by pump. In some persons, type 2 diabetes can be managed by healthful nutrition and exercise alone. If the desired glucose level is not achieved, oral medications may be prescribed. There are several classes of oral medications. Some stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, and some help insulin to work more effectively in the body by decreasing the sugar made by the liver and by increasing the sugar removed from the blood to the cells. If oral medications do not achieve the glucose goal, insulin injections may be required. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Knowing your blood lipid (fat) levels—the various forms of cholesterol and triglycerides—is important. But what these numbers mean can be confusing, and how the different types of cholesterol—not to mention other blood fats—relate to coronary artery (heart and blood vessel) disease also can be a puzzle.

There is plenty of good news to suggest that public awareness of heart disease and its risk factors is making a difference. Deaths from cardiovascular disease continue to decrease. Much credit for this encouraging trend goes to improved treatments and modification of the risk factors for heart disease, including lowering cholesterol levels. Despite these substantial improvements, the American Heart Association reports that cardiovascular disease still kills almost 1 million Americans each year. This is more than all cancer deaths combined. More than 6 million Americans experience symptoms due to coronary artery disease. As many as 1.5 million Americans will have a heart attack every year, and about half a million of them will die. Blockage of the coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle (which can lead to heart attack) causes more deaths, disability, and economic loss than any other type of heart disease. Atherosclerosis The coronary arteries are the heart’s own circulatory system. They supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients. The heart uses this blood supply for energy to perform its continuous task of pumping. Coronary artery disease can take many different forms, but each has essentially the same effect: the heart muscle does not get enough blood and oxygen through the coronary arteries. Consequently, its own demands for oxygen and nutrients are not met. This condition can be either temporary or permanent. Most coronary artery disease is caused by atherosclerosis (also known as “hardening of the arteries”). The term Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 61 62 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition In atherosclerosis, plaque deposits gradually accumulate in the lining of the arteries. As the deposits enlarge, blood circulation is impaired. This increases the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other vascular problems",

    "content": "This increases the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other vascular problems. “atherosclerosis” comes from the Greek ather (meaning “porridge”) and sklerosis (meaning “hardening”). Healthy arteries are flexible, strong, and elastic. The inner layer of arteries is smooth, enabling blood to flow freely. Atherosclerosis can be a silent, painless process in which cholesterol-containing fatty deposits accumulate in the walls of the arteries. These accumulations occur as lumps called plaques. As plaque deposits enlarge, the interior of the artery narrows, and the flow of blood is then reduced (see the illustration below). If reduced flow occurs in the coronary (heart) arteries, it can lead to a type of chest pain called angina pectoris. As a plaque enlarges, the inner lining of the artery becomes rough. A tear or rupture in the plaque may cause a blood clot to form. Such a clot can block the flow of blood or break free and plug another artery. If the flow of blood to a part of the heart is stopped, a heart attack results. If the blood flow to a part of the brain stops, a stroke occurs. Atherosclerotic plaque deposits A Closer Look at Blood Lipids Many factors influence the clogging of arteries, but cho- lesterol is a primary one. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance (a lipid). Although it is often discussed in negative terms, it is an essential component of the body’s cell mem- branes. It also serves to insulate nerves and is a building block in the formation of certain hormones. The liver uses it to make bile acids, which help digest food. Confusion about cholesterol is due in great part to the all-purpose use of the term. Cholesterol has two sources: the foods we eat (about 20%) and the cholesterol that is made by the body (about 80%). Dietary cholesterol is found only in animal products, such as meat and dairy products, or foods made with animal products. Examples include all meats, fish, and poultry, eggs, and milk products",

Both saturated (primarily from animals) and trans-saturated (oils that have been processed to make them more solid) fats increase the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. (See Chapter 2, page 26, for further description of dietary fats.) Unique Roles: LDL and HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerides Cholesterol and triglycerides are fats and are insoluble in the blood. However, when they combine with protein they become lipoproteins and are able to dissolve in and be carried by blood throughout the body. (See sidebar: Mini- Glossary of Lipid-Related Terms, above.) Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the main cholesterol carrier in the blood. There is a direct relation- ship between the level of LDL cholesterol (or total choles- terol) and the rate of coronary artery disease. When there is too much LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood, it can slowly build up in the walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. For this reason, LDL is often referred to as the “bad” cholesterol. If there are too many LDL particles in the blood, or the liver (the normal site of metabolism) does not remove LDL quickly enough from the blood, it builds, particularly in blood vessels. It is the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to counteract this effect. About a third to a fourth of blood cholesterol is carried by HDL. HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it is removed from the blood. It is therefore often referred to as the “good” cholesterol. A high level of HDL seems to protect against atherosclerosis and heart attack. The opposite is also true: a low HDL level indicates an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Thus, the goal is to have a high HDL cholesterol level and a low LDL cholesterol level",

    "content": "Thus, the goal is to have a high HDL cholesterol level and a low LDL cholesterol level. Triglycerides in the blood are derived from fats eaten in foods or produced when the body converts excess calories, alcohol, or sugar into fat. Most triglycerides are transported through the bloodstream as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Some cholesterol is also present in VLDL. A certain amount of triglycerides in the blood is normal. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue to meet the body’s needs for energy between meals. However, at high levels, triglycerides may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Increased triglyceride levels also may be a consequence of other diseases, such as untreated diabetes mellitus. Calories ingested at a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Blood Testing The only way to determine whether cholesterol and other blood lipids are in a desirable range is to have them measured by a blood test. The National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines recommend that total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides be measured at least once every 5 years in all adults age 20 or older. However, your Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 63 • Apolipoprotein—Proteins that combine with lipids to make them dissolve in the blood. • Cholesterol—A soft, waxy substance in the blood and in all your body's cells.

This is why LDL cholesterol is often called the “bad” cholesterol. • Lipoproteins—Lipids combined with apoproteins. • Triglycerides—Triglycerides are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other sources such as carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not needed immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue to meet the daily need for energy between meals. • VLDL cholesterol—In the fasting state, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) contain 15 to 20 percent of the total blood cholesterol, along with most of the triglycerides. MINI-GLOSSARY OF LIPID-RELATED TERMS 64 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition physician also may recommend that the screening include LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Triglycerides must be measured after an overnight fast because eating can have a marked effect on blood triglyc- eride levels. Therefore, fast for at least 12 hours before blood is drawn. Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before the test. If you have a risk factor(s) for heart disease, consult your physician regarding the optimal frequency of testing. (See sidebar: Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease Other Than LDL Cholesterol, below.) In a sense, it is incorrect to think of a cholesterol (or triglyceride) level as being strictly abnormal or normal. Although ranges of cholesterol levels have been identified which are considered “too high,” there is no “magic number” that separates risky levels from safe levels. Actually, the ranges for adults are based on a consensus of experts. They have identified lipid levels in the blood above which the risk for development of coronary complications is high enough to warrant medications or lifestyle changes",

    "content": "People with cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the higher-risk zones are said to be hypercholesterolemic or hypertriglyceridemic (hyper means “high,” and emic means “in the blood”). But, as with all risk factors, being in the “high” range does not guarantee that coronary artery disease will develop, nor does being in the “low” range guarantee avoiding it. Blood test numbers are only guidelines. If the numbers stray from the desirable range, a physician can provide advice on what to do. Remember that each number takes on greater meaning in light of the other lipid results and in the presence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors (see sidebar: Your Blood Lipid Test Results—What Do Those Numbers Mean? page 65). The Reasons for High Blood Lipid Levels Why do some people have high cholesterol and triglycerides? High levels may result from genetic makeup or lifestyle choices or both. Heredity may endow people with cells that do not remove LDL or VLDL cholesterol from the blood efficiently, or with a liver that produces too much cholesterol as VLDL particles or too few HDL particles. Lifestyle factors such as a high-fat diet, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity also can cause or contribute to high cholesterol levels, increasing an individual’s risk for athero- sclerosis. For a more complete picture of cardiovascular health, other risk factors—beyond cholesterol and triglycerides— must be considered. The more risk factors an individual has in combination with undesirable lipid levels, the greater the chances for development of cardiovascular disease. The risk factors for cardiovascular disease are divided into those that can be changed and those that cannot. Risk Factors That Can Be Changed or Treated Smoking cigarettes damages the walls of the blood vessels, making them more receptive to the accumulation of fatty deposits. Smoking also may lower the HDL by as much as 15 percent. Quitting smoking may return the HDL to a higher level",

Some medications for high blood pressure increase LDL and triglyceride levels and decrease HDL levels. Others do not. Blood pressure that is properly managed decreases the progression and risk for cardiovascular disease. Sedentary lifestyle is associated with a decrease in HDL. Aerobic exercise is one way to increase HDL. Aerobic activity is any exercise that requires continuous movement of the arms and legs and increases the rate of breathing. Even 30 to 45 minutes of brisk walking every other day helps protect the cardiovascular system. Obesity is a risk to cardiovascular health. Excess body fat increases total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyc- eride levels. It also lowers the HDL cholesterol level. Obesity increases blood pressure and the risk for diabetes, which can increase the chances of heart disease developing. Losing just 10 percent of excess body weight can improve triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Diabetes can increase the triglyceride level and decrease the HDL cholesterol level. Good control of blood sugar helps reduce increased triglyceride levels. • Age: males 45 years or older and females age 55 years or older, or females who have had premature menopause without estrogen replacement • Family history of early coronary artery disease • Current cigarette smoking • High blood pressure • Low HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL) • Diabetes mellitus RISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE OTHER THAN LDL CHOLESTEROL Estrogen deficiency and menopause increase the risk of heart disease. Conversely, estrogen replacement lowers the risk in certain groups of estrogen-deficient women. Risk Factors That Cannot Be Changed Aging—Aging usually increases the level of LDL cho- lesterol, although the reasons are not understood. It could be the aging process itself that causes this, or an increase in body fat with advancing age",

It is the number one killer of women, claim- ing the lives of 500,000 women every year. Cardiovascular disease occurs in women almost as often as it does in men. It just happens later in life. Before menopause, a woman’s risk of coronary artery disease is lower than that of a man. Menopause results in an increase in LDL cholesterol and a decrease in the protective HDL cholesterol. After menopause, a woman’s risk of heart disease is the same as that of a man. Treatment with estrogen helps to return the risk to premenopausal levels. Family history—A family history of abnormal lipid levels or early heart disease increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Lifestyle Changes to Reduce Risk There is significant opportunity to reduce the risk of getting cardiovascular disease. Changes in nutrition along with increased physical activity and learning to decrease stress can improve blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Making dietary changes to improve blood cholesterol and triglyc- eride levels involves these steps: Maintain a desirable weight—A diet that is high in fat also can be unnecessarily high in calories and contribute to an unhealthy weight. Decrease the total amount of fat eaten. Limit fat—saturated, polyunsaturated, and monoun- saturated—to less than 30 percent of your total daily calories (see Chapter 2, pages 26 to 29, for a description of these types of fat). Some individuals may need to restrict fats even more. Because all foods with fats contain a combina- tion of these fats, it is important to reduce total fat",

Minimize your intake of sat- urated fat. Foods high in saturated fat include red meats and dairy products as well as coconut, palm, and other tropical oils (check the ingredient portion of the food label). Replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat— Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats should make up the remaining fat allowance. In the recommended amounts, polyunsaturated fats reduce LDL cholesterol, but at the expense of the protective HDL cholesterol, whose levels also may decrease. Polyunsaturated fats are usually liquid at room temperature and in the refrigerator. Vegetable oils such as safflower, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oil are high in polyunsaturated fat",

Monounsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature but may start to solidify in the refrigerator. Olive, canola, and nut oils are sources of monounsaturated fats. (See Chapter 2, pages 26 to 29, for further discussion of unsaturated fats, and see sidebar: Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine? below.) Limit trans fat—This fat is also called partially hydro- genated vegetable oil. This type of fat may be as harmful to your health as saturated fat because it increases blood cholesterol levels, among other effects. Major sources are hardened vegetable fat, such as margarine or shortening, and products made from these fats, such as cereals, cookies, and crackers. Reduce dietary cholesterol—The daily limit for dietary cholesterol is 300 milligrams. Dietary cholesterol is found only in foods made from or containing animal products. A good way to lower dietary cholesterol is to limit the amount of meat and dairy products. Organ meats and egg yolks are also high in cholesterol. (See Chapter 2, page 27.) Eat a plant-based diet—A diet that has generous amounts of grains, vegetables, and fruits is naturally lower in fat and has good sources of soluble fiber and antioxidants, which may protect blood vessels from damage and plaque buildup. Chapters 4 and 5 present ideas for planning and preparing healthful meals. Fruits and vegetables and whole-grain products are also natural sources for folate—a B vitamin that controls the amount of homocysteine in the blood. Homocysteine is an amino acid (a building block of protein) normally found in your body. Your body needs homocysteine to manufac- ture protein to build and maintain tissue. Problems arise when there is too much homocysteine, which can cause the tissues lining the arteries to thicken and scar.

Adequate intake of this vitamin can help normalize homocysteine levels and may reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease (see sidebar: Folate and Heart Disease, page 67). There is also accumulating evi- dence that vitamin E may reduce the risk of heart attack. Cardiovascular Disease and Physical Activity Unfortunately, most of the population of the United States is sedentary. Sedentary people have nearly twice the risk of having a fatal heart attack as active people of the same age when other factors—such as smoking and high choles- terol—are equal. Consult a physician before embarking on an exercise program. Then, follow these tips for maximal results: • Choose an aerobic activity. It can be something like walking, jogging, bicycling, or swimming. • Gradually increase the time and frequency of the exercise. Work up to exercising for 30 minutes daily. When Are Medications Necessary? If changes in lifestyle have not brought lipid values into the goal range, medication may be necessary. Before recom- mending a medication, your physician will use careful judg- ment and weigh many variables—sex, age, current health, family history of early heart disease or abnormal lipids, and the side effects of medication. Who would have thought a person could consume margarine and possibly lower cholesterol? This functional food was approved for use in the United States and was introduced to the grocery shelves in 1999. Two types are available: Benecol and Take Control. Benecol is made with a refined form of plant sterol called stanol ester, which is derived from wood pulp. Take Control contains sterol esters, which are made from vegetable oils, soybean, and corn. These new margarines may help lower LDL choles- terol when used as directed by a physician. The margarines may lower LDL cholesterol 7 to 10 percent",

CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MARGARINE? OSTEOPOROSIS The word “osteoporosis” literally means “porous bones.” With osteoporosis, bones become weak and brittle—so brit- tle that even mild stresses, such as bending over to pick up a book, pushing a vacuum, or coughing, can cause a fracture. The strength of your bones relates to their mass or den- sity and is in part due to the calcium, phosphorus, and other mineral levels. In osteoporosis, the strength is decreased as calcium and other minerals are slowly depleted and bone density is undermined. Bone is living tissue that is continually changing—new bone is made and old bone is broken down, a process called “remodeling” or “bone turnover.” The cells called osteoclasts dissolve or “resorb” old bone cells, leaving tiny cavities. Another type of bone cells, called osteoblasts, line or fill these cavities with a soft honeycomb of protein fibers that become hardened by mineral deposits. A full cycle of bone remodeling takes 2 to 3 months. When you are young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone, and bone mass increases. Peak bone mass is reached in your mid-30s. The mineral-hardened honeycomb, which accounts for bone strength, depends on an adequate supply of calcium. Estrogen also plays a key role in bone health by slowing the resorption of old bone and promoting new growth. With aging, bone remodeling continues, but people lose slightly more than they gain. At menopause, when estrogen levels decrease, bone loss accelerates to 1 to 3 percent per year. Around age 60, bone loss slows again but it does not stop. Men can also have osteoporosis. By an advanced age, women have lost between 35 and 50 percent of their bone mass, and men have lost 20 to 35 percent (see illus- tration on page 70)",

    "content": "Risk Factors for Osteoporosis Despite the gloomy statistics, osteoporosis is not an inevitable part of aging. With identification of the major causes of the disease and their risk factors, osteoporosis can be detected early and treated. Moreover, a greater under- standing of the role of nutrients and hormones and new and continually emerging medications are raising hopes for prevention of the disease. How do you assess your personal chances for getting osteoporosis? Listed below are several risk factors that should be considered and evaluated: Sex—One’s sex is the most significant indicator of risk. Fractures from osteoporosis are about twice as common in women as in men. Women build less bone than men by early adulthood. Women also generally consume less calcium than men. Prolonged calcium deficiency is a risk. Moreover, studies have documented a tendency for low Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 67 FOOD SERVING FOLATE AMOUNT % DAILY VALUE SIZE (MICROGRAMS) (BASED ON 400 (CUP) MICROGRAMS) Breakfast cereals 1/2 to 1 100-400* 25-100 (check label) Lentils (cooked) 1/2 180 45 Chickpeas 1/2 140 35 Asparagus 1/2 130 33 Spinach 1/2 130 33 Black beans 1/2 130 33 Kidney beans 1/2 115 29 *Manufacturers of grain-based foods now fortify their products with folic acid—a synthetic form of the vitamin. FOLATE AND HEART DISEASE Homocysteine is an amino acid that is made from dietary protein. Too much homocysteine can damage arterial walls, allowing fatty plaque deposits to clog arteries and promote blood clotting. Folate can decrease homocysteine levels. About 400 micrograms a day is enough to lower your blood concentration of homocysteine. To get more folate, eat plenty of beans, fruits, and vegetables—preferably raw or lightly cooked. Half the folate in foods can be lost in cooking. calcium intake among adolescent girls—a time at which calcium is especially needed for bone development.

African-Americans have the lowest risk. Whites have a higher risk because they generally attain a lower peak bone mass than the others. Age—The older an individual, the higher the risk for osteoporosis. Small body frame—In general, the smaller the body frame, the thinner the bone. Lifestyle choices—Smoking increases bone loss, per- haps by decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes and reducing the absorption of calcium in the intestine. In addition, women smokers tend to enter menopause ear- lier than nonsmokers—a significant risk factor in itself. Consumption of too much caffeine or alcohol can lead to bone loss. A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor. Weight- bearing physical activity strengthens bones. Prolonged calcium deficiency does not merely mean that newly consumed calcium is not going into the bones. Because the body also needs calcium circulating in the blood, it will “rob” calcium from the bones to provide ade- quate calcium in the blood. Estrogen deficiency—The less a woman’s lifetime exposure to estrogen, the higher her risk for osteoporosis. For example, a woman will have a higher risk if she has an early menopause or began menstruating at a later age. Early menopause due to surgical removal of the ovaries also increases the risk for osteoporosis. Women generally experience a sudden drop in estrogen at menopause, which accelerates bone loss. Men experience a much more gradual decline in the production of testos- terone, and therefore they do not experience as rapid a loss of bone mass. Recent evidence suggests that estrogen also may play an important role in bone metabolism in men. There also can be a deficiency of estrogen as a result of very low weight caused by eating disorders such as anorex- ia nervosa or excessive physical activity. 68 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition HOW YOU GROW SHORTER In osteoporosis, bones become porous and weak",

Someone who is bedridden or otherwise off their feet for any extended period could have such a problem. Medications—Some medications can contribute to osteoporosis. Long-term use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, cortisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone, is very damaging to bone. People who need to take such medications for other conditions (for example, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis) should have their bone density monitored because they may require treatment to slow the rate of bone loss. Too much thyroid hormone caused by an overactive thyroid gland or excess thyroid replacement also can cause bone loss. In addition, other medications also can adversely affect bone health. If you are at risk for osteoporosis, your physician will take this into account when prescribing medications. Bone Health An individual’s risk for the development of osteoporosis depends on how much bone mass has been attained by age 25 to 35 (peak bone mass) and how rapidly it is lost after- ward. The higher the peak bone mass, the more bone a person has “in the bank” and the less likely that person is to develop osteoporosis as bone is lost during normal aging or during menopause. The decrease in bone mass and the microscopic dete- rioration of the skeleton can lead to an increased risk of bone fragility and fractures, back pain, and a loss of height (see illustration on page 70). The most common fractures resulting from osteoporosis include vertebra, hip, forearm, and wrist. Fractures can also easily occur in other bones. Fractures can severely compromise lifestyle and limit mobility. If an older woman breaks a hip, for instance, she has only a 25 percent chance of ever resuming her former level of physical activity",

Although osteoporosis generally is considered a disease that plagues elderly women, it can begin in others in their 40s and 50s. This potential crippler affects 8 to 10 million American women and about 2 million older American men. The cost of osteoporosis to the American economy is about $13 billion per year. Given current aging trends, these costs will increase dramatically in the coming decades. Testing for Osteoporosis Physicians can detect early signs of osteoporosis with a simple, painless bone density test. This test uses x-ray or ultrasound technology to measure bone density at likely sites for fractures. The test also can predict the risk of future fractures. Measuring bone density helps identify individuals who have osteoporosis or the threat of osteo- porosis. (See sidebar: Recommendations for Measuring Bone Mineral Density in Women, below.) In addition, other tests for osteoporosis are being developed and tested. Reducing the Risk for Osteoporosis Although osteoporosis may not be fully preventable, researchers are agreeing that the following steps can delay its onset or improve the treatment outlook and thereby the quality of life. Maximal Bone Mass Building maximal bone mass will make bone fractures later in life less likely. Maximal bone density depends partly on the inherited ability to make bone, the amount of calci- um consumed, and the level of exercise",

This includes women who: • have x-ray findings that suggest the presence of osteoporosis • are beginning or receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy (such as prednisone) • are perimenopausal or postmenopausal and have parathyroid disease • are undergoing treatment for osteoporosis, as a way of monitoring the effects of therapy RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEASURING BONE MINERAL DENSITY IN WOMEN risks and benefits of this type of therapy and it is closely monitored by a physician. Estrogen receptors are present in bone, and estrogen inhibits bone breakdown. Estrogen replacement therapy can decrease or prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of spine and hip fractures by as much as 50 percent. For women who already have osteoporosis (and who have no conditions prohibiting the use of estrogen), starting estrogen replacement therapy can increase bone density by as much as 10 percent in the spine and 5 percent in the hip. However, there are some risks associated with estrogen replacement therapy. Taking estrogen alone, without its natural balancing hormone progesterone, increases the risk of cancer of the uterus. And there may be a small increase in the risk of breast cancer from long-term use of estrogen. However, estrogen treatment may help decrease the risk of heart disease in certain groups and may also decrease the risk of other diseases, such as dementia. Women who have breast or uterine cancer, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or a tendency to form blood clots should avoid estrogen",

There are new types of estro- gen (estrogen analogs) that may prevent or slow the rate of bone loss without the increased risk of breast cancer. However, these drugs may not be as effective as estrogen and may not have all of the beneficial effects. In addition to estrogen and estrogen analogs, other types of medications are available and new ones are under development to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Calcium and Vitamin D Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D are critical for building peak bone mass in younger years and for slowing bone loss in later years (see sidebar: How Much Vitamin D Is Enough? page 71). Calcium is a vital mineral in the body. In addition to being one of the essential building blocks of bone, calcium is essential to the function of the muscles (including the heart) and the function of the nerves, and it helps the blood to clot in case of injury. If people fail to get enough calcium in their diets, their bodies will take calcium from the bones to keep the blood calcium level constant. Recommendations for calcium vary a bit according to age and medical status. For ages 9 to 18, 1,300 milligrams of calcium daily is recom- mended. For ages 19 to 50, the recommendation is 1,000 milligrams. Finally, for ages 51 or older, 1,200 milligrams is recommended. During pregnancy and lactation, the recommendation is 1,300 milligrams. 70 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Although osteoporosis mainly affects women, 2 million men have the disease, including one-third of men older than 75 years.

If your diet is not adequate in calcium, a supplement may be indicated (see sidebar: Tips for Selecting and Taking a Calcium Supplement, below). Dietary absorption of calcium can be assessed by your physician. A 24-hour urine collection can measure the calcium content to determine how well or how poorly calcium is being absorbed from your diet. Vitamin D helps the body absorb and metabolize calcium and deposit it in the bones. People can get vita- min D from vitamin D-fortified milk, liver, fish, egg yolks, and exposure to sunshine.

If elemental calcium is not listed on the label, the amount can be calculated as follows: • Calcium carbonate (40 percent calcium): multiply total amount of calcium carbonate by 0.4 • Calcium citrate (21 percent calcium): multiply total amount of calcium citrate by 0.21 • Calcium lactate (13 percent calcium): multiply total amount of calcium lactate by 0.13 • Calcium gluconate (9 percent calcium): multiply total amount of calcium gluconate by 0.09 Look for “USP” on the label. The U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) sets standards for quality that manufacturers must meet. These supplements meet the requirements for quality, purity, and tablet disintegration and will be better absorbed. Enhance calcium absorption—Various factors may affect calcium absorption: • Take supplements with meals—Although some foods may interfere with calcium absorption, taking a supplement with meals is more convenient. Many older adults also have reduced levels of stomach acid. Eating stimulates acid production and may enhance overall absorption. • Add vitamin D—Be sure to get adequate vitamin D in your diet. Vitamin D helps increase the absorption of calcium. If you are in doubt, take a standard multivitamin, which includes 400 units, the recom- mended standard. Minimize side effects—Some forms of calcium may be gas- forming and constipating. To minimize these effects, drink plenty of water, take the supplement with a meal, and take several smaller doses during the day. Try different calcium compounds to find one with fewer side effects. TIPS FOR SELECTING AND TAKING A CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT If a calcium supplement is indicated, here are tips to help decide which type of calcium to take and how to take it. Weight-bearing exercise increases bone density, muscle strength, and coordination, which can lower your risk for osteoporosis, falls, and broken bones",

Older adults or persons with certain diseases often benefit from a supplement. A multivitamin pill with 400 international units of vitamin D provides an adequate amount. Caffeine Limiting caffeine is a prudent idea. Too much caffeine can cause extra calcium to be lost in the urine. If an individual has only 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day and is consuming enough calcium in the diet, there should be no problem. Alcohol Consuming more than 2 drinks a day can inhibit bone formation and interfere with calcium absorption. Smoking Smoking decreases your body’s ability to form healthy bones. Weight-Bearing Exercise Weight-bearing exercise is any activity done while the bones are supporting the body’s weight. It can slow bone loss, strengthen the bones and back, improve posture, and aid in balance, which helps prevent falls. Exercises in which bone sustains repeated impact have added benefit because, for example, the leg bones respond to the impact of the feet striking the ground by slowing bone loss. Remember, it is never too late to begin an exercise program. Bone-building exercises for prevention of osteoporosis include walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skiing, and impact-producing sports. Because strong muscles exert more force, and bones respond by becoming stronger, weight lifting (or strength training) is another excellent way to forestall osteoporosis. Of course, anyone with osteo- porosis may benefit by consulting with a physician to design a safe exercise program. Trauma Avoiding trauma is a given at any stage of life, but even more so for persons with osteoporosis. Wear sturdy, low- heeled shoes with nonslip soles, and check your home for potential obstacles that could cause a fall, such as low tables, loose rugs, or inadequate lighting. The broken bones that come from tumbles and falls can produce serious, even life-threatening, medical complications",

Countless numbers of Americans who are alive today have had cancer and are now considered to be cured. (“Cured” is defined here as being free of any evidence of the disease for 5 years or more.) They may have the same life expectancy as others of the same age and sex who have never had cancer, and they can anticipate leading mean- ingful and productive lives. Despite such impressive statistics, cancer remains a serious disease. Annually, cancer is diagnosed in more than a million people (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the United States. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Some cancers affect just one organ, and others are more general- ized. In each of its types, however, cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells (see illustration on page 74). Why cancer develops in some people who are exposed to potentially cancer-causing agents but not in others is Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 73 “Cancer” is derived from a Latin word meaning “crab” and was first described in writings attributed to Hippocrates and other Greek physicians (500 B.C. to 200 A.D.). These physicians described various tumors and classified them as either “carcinos” (benign growths that do not spread) or as “carcinomas” or “crab-like” (growths that invade surrounding tissues and cause death). The term “neoplasm” was described by Galen (200 A.D.) as mean- ing “new growth that is contrary to nature.” The word “metastasis” is also a Greek word meaning “to change places.” It is used to describe the ability of cancer to migrate to other tissues or organs and to form additional tumors.

The Biology of Cancer A biomedical revolution is advancing knowledge of the causes of cancer, yielding new and more effective treatments and inspiring greater hope for cancer prevention. This revolution is built on scientific investigation of the basic processes that cause cancer. The body is a living, growing system that contains billions of individual cells. These cells carry out all of the body’s functions, such as metabolism, transportation, excretion, reproduction, and locomotion. The body grows and develops as a result of increases in numbers of new cells and their changes into different types of tissue. New cells are created through the process of cell division (mitosis). Different types of cells are created by a process called cell differentiation, by which they acquire specialized function. Cell division results in the normal pattern of human growth; 74 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Cancer cells, left untreated, invade and penetrate the walls of blood and lymph vessels. Once in these systems, they travel to other sites, such as the lungs, bone, or brain. Primary tumor Normal tissue cell Invading tumor cell Blood vessel not fully understood. But what is known is that many cancers develop slowly. It may be 5 to 40 years after expo- sure to a cancer-causing agent before there is any evidence of the disease. Cancer of the lung, for example, may not appear until 25 years or more after sustained exposure to tobacco smoke. This long delay between exposure and development of the disease may partly explain why so many people ignore the warnings associated with smoking. The Nutrition-Cancer Connection During the past 30 years, research has shown that nutri- tion plays a significant role in the development of many cancers and that proper food choices might help to reduce the risk of cancer or even prevent it",

    "content": "About a third of the 500,000 cancer deaths that occur each year in the United States can be attributed to dietary factors. The good news is that in addition to engaging in regular exer- cise and not smoking, people have control over this impor- tant factor in cancer development—their food choices. cell differentiation makes possible the normal, orderly pattern of growth and development. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells lack the control mech- anisms that stop, or “switch off,” growth. They divide without restraint, displacing neighboring normal cells, affecting their normal function and growth, and compet- ing with them for available nutrients. These uncontrolled cells can grow into a mass called a tumor and invade and destroy nearby normal tissue. They also can migrate in a process called “metastasis,” spreading via the blood or lymph system to other parts of the body. Not all cells that have rapid or uncontrolled growth are cancerous. Cells may amass as benign tumors, which do not invade or destroy surrounding tissues. Although science has yet to understand the processes by which all cells grow, divide, communicate, and differentiate, much has been learned about how normal cells are activated or altered into cancerous cells in both inherited and non- inherited forms of cancer. The Causes of Cancer Cancer is caused by factors that are external (chemicals, radiation, viruses, and diet) and internal (hormones, immune and metabolic conditions, and inherited [genet- ic] alterations). Some of these factors are avoidable; oth- ers are not. Scientists have identified many of the controllable risk factors that increase the chances of get- ting cancer. A complex mix of these factors, acting togeth- er or in some cascade of events, promotes cancer cell growth. When the genetic programming of a normal cell is disrupted, its malignant potential is released. Everyone carries this malignant potential within them in normal genes known as proto-oncogenes",

Products of these genes perform useful functions, such as regulating cell division and cell differentiation. These functions, however, may be compromised with aging or by exposure to cancer-causing (carcinogenic) agents. When this happens, they may be activated to become oncogenes, coordinating the conver- sion of normal cells to cancer cells. Nutrition can influence any of the steps involved in the development of cancer. The development of cancer (carcinogenesis) and its relationship to nutrition is a com- plex process. Isolating and proving dietary cause-and-effect relationships can be difficult. In addition, studies can be con- fusing and sometimes show conflicting results. Nevertheless, the potential for nutrition to increase or decrease the risk of various cancers is compelling. Dietary Guidelines to Reduce the Risk of Cancer Just as negative dietary and lifestyle choices can signifi- cantly increase the risk of cancer, evidence is mounting that appropriate food choices can be powerful tools in reducing risk and even defensive shields in preventing cancer. The American Cancer Society offers these four guidelines to reduce cancer risk: • Choose most of the foods you eat from plant sources. • Limit your intake of high-fat foods, particularly from animal sources. • Be physically active: achieve and maintain a healthful weight (see Chapter 1, page 8). • Limit consumption of alcoholic beverages, if you drink at all. The Society’s recommendations are consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see Chapter 1, pages 8 and 11). Although no diet can guarantee full protection against disease, the American Cancer Society believes that these recommendations offer the best nutrition information currently available to help reduce your risk of cancer.

Choose Most of the Foods You Eat From Plant Sources Choosing foods from plant sources is vital to a healthful diet. Many scientific studies have shown that increased con- sumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains reduces the risk for cancers of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and for lung cancer. This reduction is one of the reasons foods of plant origin form the basis of the Food Guide Pyramid. Plant foods contain beneficial vitamins, minerals, fibers, and hundreds of other cancer-protective substances. Although more research is needed to understand what specific properties or substances in plant foods may specif- ically protect against cancer, there are already many candidates under investigation—from vitamins and minerals to fiber and phytochemicals (including carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenes, sterols, indoles, and phenols). Because the positive effects from these components may derive from the whole foods in which they are found, experts recommend food over supplements (see sidebar: Food Versus Supplements, page 76; and see Chapter 2, Phytochemicals—A Food Pharmacy That May Fight Disease, page 35). Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 75 Antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may help to prevent cancer. These are nutrients that seem to offer the body some protection against oxidation—damage done to tissue in the course of normal cellular function which may contribute to the effects of aging and to increased cancer risk. Various antioxidant nutrients—including vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and carotenoids —may provide the body with some defense against cancer. Researchers are studying the protective role of antioxidants (see sidebar: Food Sources of Antioxidants, page 32, and see Appendix, Phytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484). Grains provide vitamins and minerals, such as folate, calcium, and selenium, which may also protect against cancer",

    "content": "Whole grains are preferable to refined grains because they have more fiber and an abundance of certain vitamins and minerals. Beans and legumes are also good sources of nutrients that have cancer-protective qualities. (See page 20 for more information about fiber.) Although more research is needed to clarify the specific roles of these food components, there is still ample evidence to support eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegeta- bles a day (especially deep-green and dark-yellow to orange fruits and vegetables, those from the cabbage family, and legumes and soy products) and 6 to 11 servings of grains (with an emphasis on whole grains). Limit High-Fat Foods, Particularly From Animal Sources Decreasing the intake of high-fat foods, especially from animal sources, is very important. Studies show that people who eat a high-fat diet have increased rates of cancers of the colon, rectum, prostate, and endometrium (lining of the uterus). Although these relationships exist, it is not clear whether they are due to the total amount of fat in the diet, to a particular kind of fat (saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated), or to another, unknown, factor. Because fat, by weight, contains twice the number of calories than protein or carbohydrate, it is difficult to separate the effects of the fat from the effects of its calories. People who eat a high-fat diet are often heavier and tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables, which also increases cancer risk. Consumption of red meat, a major source of fat in the American diet, is linked to an increased cancer risk, particularly of the colon and prostate. Scientists are unable to determine whether the connection between red meat and cancer is due to total fat, saturated fat, or other com- pounds. Meat contains compounds linked to cancer, such as heterocyclic amines, which are produced when it is cooked (see sidebar: Meat—Cooking and Cancer, page 77). This may be a link to colon cancer",

There is no evidence that mineral or vitamin supplements are better than obtaining nutrients through whole foods. In fact, studies in which subjects received supplements of beta- carotene showed conflicting and even harmful results. Smokers given supplemental beta-carotene had a higher incidence of lung cancer. Other studies of supplemental beta-carotene have shown neither benefit nor harm. There are more than 500 known carotenoids. Of these, only a few have been analyzed: alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. At this time, it is not known which exerts benefits—or risks. Experts recommend a diet rich in fruits, grains, and vegetables rather than taking supplements. Plants contain hundreds of cancer-protective substances. It is not known which of the substances may specifically protect against can- cer. In addition, it is not known whether these substances work independently or benefit from working together. Plus, relying on supplements rather than eating a variety of foods makes it impossible to benefit from these now unknown food compounds. FOOD VERSUS SUPPLEMENTS Every day there seems to be a headline announcing that some nutrient or food compound has been linked to preventing some sort of cancer. Driving this is the tremendous amount of research exploring specific food components and their role in the cancer process. DO SUPPLEMENTS OFFER CANCER PROTECTION? Different fats (such as omega-3 fatty acids and vegetable oil) may have different effects on your risk of cancer. Saturated fat is a particular concern for cancer risk and for coronary artery disease. How food is prepared is also important. Some cooking methods, such as baking, stewing, boiling, and poaching, are healthier ways than frying, broiling, or grilling",

There is no question that limiting alcohol consump- tion reduces cancer risk. The risk of cancer begins to increase with an intake of as few as 2 drinks a day. Alcohol Chapter 3: The Food-Health Connection 77 TYPE OF FOOD HCA is found in cooked muscle meats. Other protein sources (milk, eggs, tofu, and organ meats such as liver) have little or no HCA naturally or when cooked. TEMPERATURE Cooking temperature is the most important factor in reducing the formation of HCA. Cooking in an oven at 400° Fahrenheit or less or stewing, boiling, or poaching at 212° Fahrenheit or less forms one-third of HCAs versus meats prepared by frying, broiling, or grilling. COOKING METHOD Frying, broiling, and barbecuing produce the largest amounts of HCA—these methods have higher than recommended cooking temperatures. Microwaving meats for 2 minutes helps to decrease HCA. Meats that are microwaved before frying, broiling, or grilling have a 90 percent decrease in HCA content. Marinating meats before cooking also inhibits the production of HCA. TIME Meats cooked well done (no pink remaining in center) have more HCA than those cooked medium. MEAT—COOKING AND CANCER Cooking meat at high temperatures creates chemicals that are not present in uncooked meats. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are chemicals linked to cancer that are formed when meat is exposed to high temperatures. Four factors influence HCA formation: along with tobacco use produces a combined cancer risk that is greater than the sum of their individual effects. The risks for cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and larynx are particularly increased. Research also has noted a connection between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of breast cancer",

Use the Food EAT BREAKFAST Whether at home or away, start your day with breakfast. “Breaking the fast” provides your body with both nutrients and energy. People who eat breakfast tend to have more energy and, on average, are better able to regulate their appetite during the remainder of the day than their break- fast-skipping counterparts. Unfortunately, many Americans do not eat breakfast. Some skip breakfast because of their schedule, whereas others do so in a misguided attempt to control weight. However, you can eat a healthful breakfast with the time you have. There are many ways to make what is perhaps the day's most important meal a nutritious, fast, and convenient one. Build a Better Breakfast Breakfast is the foundation of a healthful diet. Use the Food Guide Pyramid as a practical resource for planning your breakfasts regardless of whether you choose foods that require preparation or select ones that are ready-to-go. Cereals are a good choice. Simple whole-grain cereals with no added sugar or fat are best (see sidebar: Cold Breakfast Cereals, this page). A breakfast that includes a whole-grain cereal, bread, low-fat milk, and a glass of orange juice is a great starter meal.

Maybe you prefer eggs for breakfast. The current rec- ommendation is to limit your intake of whole eggs to 3 or 4 per week. The reason to limit eggs is that the yolk of a large-sized egg contains about 210 milligrams of choles- terol—more than two-thirds of the daily cholesterol allowance. However, eggs also have many nutrients. People with a low blood cholesterol level probably can safely eat a few more eggs than those who have a high level. Create an omelet with 1 whole egg plus 2 egg whites, sweet peppers, and onions. Serve with oven-browned potatoes and a slice of whole-grain toast topped lightly with butter or margarine. Or, better yet, top with jam or jelly as a no-fat alternative. Remember to include fruit or juice.

Fortunately, if you know what you are looking for, a nutritious breakfast can be found almost anywhere food is served. If you are traveling and have time for a “sit-down” breakfast, choose a restaurant that offers a varied menu. If not, try bagel shops, fast-food establishments, the company cafeteria, or even a nearby vending machine. Some may have a “buffet break- fast” that has everything you need, including hot and cold cereals, breads, bagels, fresh fruit and fruit juices, low-fat milk, and yogurt. Others also may offer options such as low-fat burritos, low-fat granola, or low-fat muffins. (See sidebar: Best Bets When Eating Breakfast Out, below.) WHAT’S FOR LUNCH?

    "content": "Your options include bringing a lunch from home or purchasing foods in a cafeteria, vending machine, or local delicatessen. The same rules apply for “eating well” at lunch: plan to eat foods low in saturated fat and high in nutrients. This midday meal helps you meet your goal of 5 fruits and veg- etables every day, and it is the perfect time to include whole grains. Lunch helps you to distribute your intake of calories and nutrients evenly throughout the day. It can keep energy levels high and help prevent unplanned snacking on foods that may not be the best choices. Brown Bagging Bringing a lunch to work can save you money and help you eat what you really want to eat. To be sure that your lunch tastes good and is good for you, try to incorporate each of the food groups in your lunch. If you bring too little food, you will likely be hungry later in the day. You then increase the chance that you will snack before supper or eat too much at supper. To keep brown-bag fare interesting and healthful, pack more variety. Think of the options: Grains—Instead of the usual sandwich bread, try pita (pocket) bread, tortilla wraps, crackers, pretzels, or rice cakes. Or, try salads made with nutritious grains. Fruits—Include fresh fruits. Every now and then, choose an “exotic” fruit to add interest. Try star fruit, kiwi, papaya, mango, or passion fruit. (See Part II, Fruits, page 153.) Fruit juices can be nutritious and refreshing. Vegetables—Expand your repertoire from raw carrots and celery sticks to potentially more satisfying vegetable soups and salads. Stuff pocket bread with a variety of cooked vegetables. Use vegetables to make your sandwich more filling: fresh spinach or romaine, and slices of cucum- ber, tomato, mushrooms, and sweet or chili peppers. A vegetable juice makes a great lunchtime drink. Dairy—Some days drink milk. Other days eat yogurt or a bit of cheese. Choose the low-fat forms more fre- quently to be sure your meal is rich in nutrients and not fat and calories",

To help take meat off center stage, be sure that you also include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains in your lunch. Eat only lean meats. When possible, instead of meat, try to substitute foods such as hummus, lentils, beans, tofu, and nut spreads, which contain large amounts of plant protein (see sidebar: Sandwich Fixings, below). Vary the temperature of your lunch by including both hot and cold items. A thermos will preserve heat more effectively if you first rinse it with hot water. Likewise, rinsing with cold water will help keep foods cold longer. If your workplace does not have a refrigerator, a thermal lunch bag can help keep your food fresh and safe. A frozen box of juice can help keep your lunch cold, and the juice will thaw by lunchtime. Going Out for Lunch? If you know what you are doing, eating lunch out increases your options rather than your temptations. Most fast-food restaurants, eager to please the ever-growing number of people who insist on eating more nutritious foods, now offer “lighter” fare such as salads and chicken. But be careful that you don’t choose foods that are healthful in name only. Many foods that at first glance seem to be good choices in fact are loaded with fat and calories. Salad Savvy Simple salads are best. To construct a nutritious salad, incorporate lots of fresh vegetables and fruits",

Remember that the word “salad” is not synonymous with “healthful.” Try to eat salads that are low in calories and fat but high in much-needed nutrients (see sidebar: Salad Fixings, page 83). Many taco salads contain at least 900 calories, more than half of which comes from fat. High-fat meats and cheeses heaped on a chef salad can dominate the vegetables. Chicken and seafood are low in fat; however, this advantage is lost when they are covered with high-fat dressings and oils. Many of today’s salad bars look like delicatessens. Pasta salad, potato salad, guacamole, and tortellini are popular items. Depending on how they are made, they too can be high in fat and calories. Unless used sparingly, some dressings can provide up to 400 calories to your salad.

Snack items such as pretzels or baked chips, although high in salt, are relatively low in calories.

    "content": "Unfortunately, a leisurely supper usually gives way to evening demands such as a school meeting, a child’s soccer game, or your own “home work.” Sometimes the very thought of preparing a nutri- tious supper seems overwhelming after a hectic day. However, with a little planning, you can still eat well. Make Time for the Evening Meal If possible, make time for supper. The evening meal is often the main meal of the day. It therefore can go a long way to ensure that you get all of your daily nutrient require- ments. In addition, a satisfying supper decreases your chances of eating an unplanned after-supper snack. Enticing Evening Meals Try to incorporate food from each food group into your evening meal. Make an effort to eat more plant-based foods. These nicely complement smaller servings of lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Try cuisine from other parts of the world—particularly those that feature grains, vegetables, and fruits as the centerpiece of the meal. Make your meals interesting by varying the colors, textures, and shapes of foods. You do not have to be a great chef to give supper the visual appeal that everyone wants to eat. Fruits and vegetables add color and all the vitamins, minerals, and fiber your body needs. Breads come in a broad variety of shapes and textures— from long, thin French baguettes to braided challah bread to the blackest of pumpernickels. The same goes for pasta. In addition to your usual favorites, try whole-wheat spaghetti, farfalle (bow-tie), fusilli (little springs), orzo (rice-shaped), or ziti (large tubes)",

Instead of plain white rice, try basmati, jasmine rice, or nutrient-rich brown rice. Wild rice (not really a “rice” but a seed from a type of grass) adds both crunch and a nutty flavor to a meal. Instead of red meat, eat fish and poultry more often. Seafood cases are stocked with a wide variety of fish fillets and “steaks” from around the world. In addition to domes- tic chicken or turkey, poultry choices include wild game birds and small “hens.” When you choose a red meat, eat a lean cut and vary the seasonings. Try to have some meat- less meals. A supper containing legumes, beans, and other vegetarian fare is high in protein and low in saturated fat. Top off the evening meal with fresh fruit and a selection of low-fat cheese, a fresh whole-grain cake, frozen low-fat yogurt, ice cream, or sherbet.

Dining Out Eating out is an American passion. In fact, Americans spend almost half their food dollars in restaurants. With the wide array of restaurants that are available in most com- munities, dining out should be a pleasure rather than a threat to your resolve to eat well. Listed here are five points to remember when you eat out. Think of these as five tips for eating well when eating out. Choose restaurants that help you achieve your daily 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables Choose restaurants that offer a wide selection of fruits and vegetables. Look for fruit and vegetable selections in the appetizer, entrée, and dessert menus which are prepared without added fat. Choose ethnic and vegetarian restau- rants that feature grain- and vegetable-based meals. Chapter 4: Planning Meals 85 Lower the fat in four ways When ordering, consider these four methods to lower the amount of fat in your meals: Cooking method—If the menu item is described as fried or sautéed, ask that it be baked or broiled. This simple request can save 10 to 30 grams of fat and about 100 to 300 unwanted calories. “On the side”—Ask for the sauce, condiment, salad dressing, or topping to be put “on the side.” If a dish is pre- pared with a high-fat sauce (such as Alfredo, cream sauce, cheese, or gravy), request that it be placed on the side or ask for a lower-fat alternative such as a marinara sauce",

Serving size—Bigger is not necessarily better, especially when it comes to calories, fat, and your health. Terms such as “mammoth,” “deluxe,” and “hearty” are your tip-offs. Order smaller portions. Ask for a “take-home” container, or plan to share your meal with your dinner companion so you do not feel obligated to eat it all. Substitute lower-fat choices—Make sure that your meal has plenty of grains, vegetables, and fruits. Take meat away from center stage by starting with a tossed salad. Ask for extra steamed vegetables. The bread basket generally offers a whole-grain choice. Don’t forget to finish the meal with fresh fruit, sherbet, or sorbet and a glass of low-fat milk. Try to avoid the high-fat, calorie-rich desserts that you will later wish you had not eaten. Limit meat to 3 ounces per serving (or no more than 6 ounces per day) Health experts agree that Americans eat too much meat (including poultry and fish), especially in light of the fact that our bodies need only a relatively small amount of protein. Large portions of meat almost invariably contribute excess calories, fat, and cholesterol to the meal. A 3-ounce portion is about the size of a deck of cards. Whenever you eat meat, poultry, or fish, try to be sure that you eat a total of only 6 ounces per day (see sidebar: “Cut” Your Portions of Meat, this page). Limit alcohol to 2 drinks (1 if you are a woman) Most authorities suggest that alcohol be limited to 2 drinks per day if you are a man, 1 drink per day if you are a woman. All alcohol-containing drinks contain calories (see sidebar: A Drink Defined..., page 87). Make eating well your number 1 priority Restaurants are in the business of satisfying their customers.

Ethnic Cuisine: Your Passport to Healthful Meals Ethnic restaurants and grocery stores offer a wide variety of culinary alternatives. Often, ethnic cuisines are plant- based, and thus many people assume they are healthful. However, that is not always the case. Some guidelines below, in addition to the suggestions previously mentioned, will help you to savor the exotic flavors while keeping calories, fat, cholesterol, and sodium under control. Asian cuisine features rice, noodles, and vegetables with little or no meat. However, it may not be as healthful as one believes. For example, fried rice is just what it says—fried. Therefore, white rice or, even better, brown rice would be a healthier option.

    "content": "Make a List Make a grocery list. A mental list may work, but a struc- tured plan generally is more effective. A written list helps ensure that you select the ingredients and foods that you want rather than things you select on impulse. A checklist also can save time by avoiding the need to come back to pick up forgotten items. At the Store Most Americans make one or more trips to the grocery store every week. Some people consider grocery shopping a form of entertainment, but others regard it as a chore. No matter how you feel about shopping, a few strategies can make your investment of time worthwhile. Shop the perimeter—The freshest foods generally are located along the perimeter of the store. These include fresh fruits, vegetables, breads, dairy products, and meats. Choose whole-grain breads from the bakery, low-fat products from the dairy section, and lean cuts from the meat section. Higher-fat foods often are stocked in the interior of the store. However, grains, legumes, pastas, and canned fruits and vegetables also are frequently located in the interior. Shop from your list—A list helps ensure that you stick to your plan. Items purchased on impulse generally are more expensive and less nourishing than foods from a well- planned shopping list. Do not shop when hungry—If you go to the store with a growling stomach, you are apt to make purchases to satisfy your immediate hunger rather than what you will need in the days ahead. You also tend to buy more. Shopping on a full stomach helps you stick to your list and to keep your resolve. Make bargains count—A bargain is only a bargain when you buy what you want rather than what someone else is trying to sell you. Select bargains that fit your menu, such as in-season fruits and vegetables or bulk quantities of rice, beans, and legumes. Use coupons to reduce the cost of foods that you intend to buy.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established requirements for food labels in order to make nutrition information accurate, clear, consistent, and useful to con- sumers. Food labels provide four different types of infor- mation: nutrition facts, a list of ingredients, nutrients, and health claims. Nutrient facts and ingredients Labels tell you almost everything you need to know about what is contained in the food. The Nutrition Facts panel tells you how many calories and how much fat, choles- terol, protein, and carbohydrate are in a single serving of the food. It also tells you the fiber, vitamin (A and C), and mineral (sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron) contents of the food. This information allows you to compare the nutrients found in similar foods. For example, you can compare two yogurts for their calorie and fat content. Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, with the first item listed being the predominant one in the food. By reading the label, you can tell which foods have added 88 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Use labels to compare similar foods and to make the healthiest choices. saturated fats or ingredients to which you may be intolerant. Use the label to select the best choices—foods that are high in nutrients and low in calories and fat. To help you make the wisest choices, acquaint yourself with each of the components of the label (see sidebar: Anatomy of a Food Label, below). Some foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and bulk items, do not have nutrition labels. The nutrition information for these foods generally either is on display nearby or is available elsewhere in the store as a handout. When in doubt, ask the store personnel for assistance.

CALORIES FROM FAT: This information underscores the fat content per serving of foods to help you meet the recom- mendation of no more than 30 percent of calories from fat. Remember, it’s your total fat intake over a period of time (such as 24 hours), and not the amount in one food or meal, that’s important. PERCENT DAILY VALUE: The percent daily values show the percentage of a nutrient that is provided by this product serving, based on a 2,000- calorie diet. Use the percent daily value figures to compare products easily and to tell whether a food is high or low in nutrients. NUTRIENTS: At a minimum, all calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, choles- terol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron are listed. Experts believe that too much or too little of these nutrients has the greatest impact on your health. CALORIES PER GRAM: This shows the calorie content of the energy- producing nutrients.

Nutrient claims help guide you more quickly to certain products. Products also may claim that they benefit certain health conditions. Health claims may suggest that eating a food alters your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, cancer, or osteoporosis. The government regulates these claims so they are truthful and meet certain criteria. Manufacturers are not required by law to carry nutrient or health claims. (See sidebars: Nutrient Claims, page 92, and Health Claims, page 93.) FOODS AND ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE WONDERED ABOUT Farming methods are rapidly evolving. New foods and novel ingredients are continuously being introduced into the marketplace. Pesticides and fertilizers are used to increase yields. Genetic engineering potentially can produce safer, more nutritious, and cheaper forms of foods. Substitutes (such as sugar, fat, and salt substitutes) enable some people to eat foods that would otherwise endanger their health. However, not everyone would agree that these changes are an advance because many have been accompanied by uncer- tainty and, in some instances, controversy. What about additives? Organic foods? Irradiated foods? What does it mean when a food is enriched or fortified? Read on. What About Pesticides? Pesticides and modern pest management practices have helped to ensure that we have a reliable, affordable, varied, nutritious, and safe food supply. Pesticides are chemicals that kill or prevent the growth of weeds (herbicides), bac- teria (disinfectants and antibiotics), molds and fungi (fungi- cides), and harmful insects (insecticides)",

    "content": "Some pesticides occur naturally in soil, whereas others are found in com- pounds isolated from particular plants. Many farmers try to control pests in the most effective, least disruptive manner by practicing what is known as integrated pest manage- ment. This approach includes companion planting with plants that contain natural pesticides, crop rotation, use of sterile strains of insects or insect pheromones (to alter reproduction patterns and thereby reduce the insect pop- ulation), natural insect predators, pest-resistant plant strains, mathematical forecasting techniques, and, when necessary, chemical pesticides. Should you worry about pesticide residues? The answer is a qualified “no.” The upper limit of the amount of pesticide residue permitted on both raw and processed foods has been carefully established and is enforced by several gov- ernment agencies. These upper limits are far less than the levels of exposure that are considered harmful. However, to reduce your exposure to pesticide residues further, you can take the following steps: • Carefully select the produce you buy (avoid cuts, holes, or signs of decay). • Thoroughly wash all produce with water (not soap) to remove surface residues. • Scrub carrots and potatoes and other root vegetables thoroughly. Wash other fresh fruits and vegetables with a brush. Resist the temptation to peel apples, pears, cucumbers, potatoes, and other produce with edible skin, because peeling removes a valuable source of fiber. • Remove the outer leaves (and any inner leaves that appear to be damaged) from leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage. • Eat a variety of foods rather than large amounts of a single food. What About Food Additives? Contrary to what many of us think, food additives have been used for centuries (and until the past 100 or so years, without much regard for health considerations). Additives play various roles in foods. Some additives act as preserv- atives, preventing spoilage, loss of flavor, texture, or nutri- tive value",

    "content": "These include antioxidants such as vitamin E, BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), BHT (butylated hydroxy- toluene), citric acid, and sulfites; calcium propionate; sodi- um nitrite (which prevents infection by the dangerous bacteria that causes botulism); and other antimicrobials (germ-fighting additives). Other additives are used as emulsifiers to prevent foods from separating. Emulsifiers include lecithin from soy, egg yolks, or milk and mono- glycerides and diglycerides. The leavening agents sodium bicarbonate (baking soda and powder) and yeast allow baked goods to rise. Stabilizers and thickeners create and maintain an even texture and flavor in foods such as ice cream and pudding. Many foods are also fortified or enriched with vitamins, minerals, or proteins or their com- ponent amino acids (see page 25). The government strictly regulates food additives. The safety and effectiveness of each newly proposed additive must be rigorously tested. Some 700 additives belong to a group of substances referred to as GRAS substances (Generally Recognized As Safe) because extensive testing and use have shown no evi- dence of adverse effects. Continued approval requires that all additives, including GRAS substances, must be reevaluated regularly with the latest scientific methods. According to law, additives and preservatives must be list- ed on food labels. People who are sensitive to certain additives such as sulfites or mono- sodium glutamate should be sure to read labels for additive information. Organic Foods: Are They Really Better? If pesticides and food additives pose any potential risk at all, would we be better off eating only “organically grown” foods? What is an organic food? Organic farming methods are those that use only nonsynthetic products (substances that are naturally found in the environment)",

    "content": "Can you be sure that the organic products you buy are really grown and produced organically? In 1998, Congress enacted the Organic Foods Production Act, which regulates production and processing standards for organic foods. This act specifies that foods sold as “organically grown” or “organically processed” must be certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, organically pro- duced foods may not be 100 percent organic. By law, they must have at least 50 percent of their ingredients produced naturally, and organically processed foods must contain at least 95 percent organically produced ingredients. Are these foods better? Not necessarily. Nutritionally, organically grown foods may not be significantly different from the same products grown with conventional farming techniques. The nutrient content of a product is determined by many factors, including the composition of the soil, the genetic makeup of the plant, the degree of maturity at harvest, and methods of handling after harvest. The taste of organic products may or may not differ from that of conventionally grown foods. Organic methods tend to be more costly (in terms of both labor and materials), production is lower, and consumer prices tend to be high- er. In addition, organic methods are not always safer. Some pesticides reduce the risk of exposure to certain harmful organisms that represent a much greater potential risk than does exposure to the pesticide. In most instances, personal preference rather then proven benefit determines whether you choose to eat an organic food. What About Irradiated Foods? Until the 1800s, soaking in salt and natural fermentation were the most commonly used methods for food preservation. This changed with the introduction of canning in the 1800s. Pasteurization began to be used in the late 1800s to kill harm- ful bacteria, freezing in the early 1900s to extend the shelf life of foods, and freeze drying in the 1960s to preserve foods. Food is irradiated when it is passed through a beam of radiant energy",

    "content": "Food is irradiated when it is passed through a beam of radiant energy. Irradiated foods are not radioactive. Irradiation does not diminish the importance of safe food handling (see Chapter 5, Food Safety, page 148), nor does it improve the quality of food. However, irra- diation can extend the shelf life, reduce food wastage, and reduce food prices. Most importantly, irradiation can destroy bacteria that cause food- borne illness. Food irradiation is strictly controlled by the Food and Chapter 4: Planning Meals 91 Government regulations require irradiated food at the retail level to be labeled \"Treated with Radiation\" or \"Treated by Irradiation\" and to bear this international logo, the radura. Drug Administration (FDA). All irradiated foods carry a symbol and the phrase “Treated by Irradiation.” However, when irradiated foods are used in a restaurant, they are not required to be labeled. What About Genetically Engineered Foods? Modern genetic-engineering techniques are a refinement of traditional plant-breeding methods. Genetic engineers first select a desired plant trait. They then isolate and modify the gene(s) responsible for the trait. Finally, they attempt to introduce the altered gene into other plants. In essence, genetic engineering accelerates the natural mix- ing of genes that normally would occur among various plant species. Genetic engineering of plants has yielded several benefits. Farmers can protect crops against weeds with genetically engineered biodegradable herbicides that need fewer applications. Genetic engineering also can extend the time before spoilage begins, enabling growers to harvest foods closer to peak freshness. Crops can be genetically engineered to be drought- and temperature-resistant. Genetic engineering can increase crop yields and enable plants to tolerate a wider range of climates. Genetic engi- neering also can increase the amount and quality of protein in beans and in grains such as rice",

Therefore, the debate continues regarding how genetically engineered foods should be developed and regulated. What Do the Terms “Fortified” and “Enriched” Mean? Do you know the difference between the terms “fortified” and “enriched”? Both words indicate that nutrients have been added to the food. Fortified means that nutrients were added that were not there originally. Enriched means that nutrients lost during processing are replaced. Fortified and enriched foods have helped eliminate many once- common nutritional deficiency diseases. Salt was the first commercial food item in the United States to be fortified with additional nutrients. Since 1924, potassium iodide has been added to table salt to help prevent goiter (an enlarged thyroid that may result from iodine deficiency)",

Rickets, a deforming bone disease, can result from too little vitamin D. Rickets was very common during the early part of the century when working children were deprived of nutri- tious diets and sunlight. Flour, and products made with flour, were first fortified with vitamins and iron in 1940 at the start of World War II.

Many of these vitamins may dissolve into the milk that you pour over the cereal, so it is important to drink the milk at the bottom of the bowl. (Plus, milk itself provides its own nutrients.) Most recently, folic acid has joined the list of fortifiers added to grain-based (bread, cereal, pasta, rice) foods to help meet nutrient needs and to reduce the incidence of birth defects and possibly the risk of heart disease. Chapter 4: Planning Meals 93 DISEASE/NUTRIENT OR FOOD EXAMPLE OF A HEALTH CLAIM Osteoporosis/calcium Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium help teens and young adult white and Asian women maintain good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later in life. Cancer/fat Development of cancer depends on many factors. A diet low in total fat may reduce the risk of some cancers. Cancer/fiber-containing foods Low-fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Cancer/fruits and vegetables Low-fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber.

The foods must also meet specific nutrient requirements. Below are several examples of FDA-approved health claims. 94 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition Chapter 4: Planning Meals 95 Two Weeks of Menus T he following pages contain 14 days’ worth of nutritionally balanced menus. The menus emphasize whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables. They are low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, moderate in sodium, and high in taste. In addition, they are a great source of health-enhancing phytonutrients. The actual guidelines for the menus are listed below. The serving sizes are based on the Food Guide Pyramid (see Chapter 1, page 11). For each day, the breakdown of servings from the Food Guide Pyramid is provided. Accompanying each menu, there is one recipe. Use these menus as a guide to begin to eat a more nutritiously balanced diet. As needed, make adjustments to suit your needs. If you need additional (or fewer) calories, simply add or take away a serving. If you need to add servings, we suggest adding a whole grain, piece of fresh fruit, or more vegetables. These menus take the information that has been discussed throughout the book and help you put it on the table. Bon appetit",

In this chapter you will learn: • Ways to modify recipes to be lower in calories, fat, sugar, and salt and yet be nutritious and flavorful • Ways to create menus that bring healthier, plant-based foods — fruits, vegetables, and grains — to center stage • How to prepare, serve, and store food safely The art of cooking is to put the proper amounts of these ingredients in each food. Recipe modification is one of the more useful cooking skills. In some instances, modification of the fat, sugar, or salt content actually can make the food tastier, moister, and more satisfying than it was originally. When Should a Recipe Be Modified? Sometimes it is difficult to know whether a recipe can be adjusted without sacrificing taste, texture, and appeal. Try modifying a recipe if you answer “yes” to any of the following questions: • Is the recipe high in fat, sugar, or salt? • Is this a food I eat frequently? • Is this a food I eat in large amounts? Keep in mind that not every recipe needs to be modified. If, for example, a certain high-fat dessert is a family favorite and it is prepared infrequently, there is no need to change it. As long as it is treated as an item from the top of the Food Guide Pyramid (see Chapter 1, page 11)—the occasional food—enjoy it in its familiar form. Experiment Because every recipe is different, experimentation is necessary. There are numerous ways to make a recipe healthier. Of course, not every experi- ment works. It may take several attempts to achieve the desired taste and consistency. Once the modified recipe meets your expec- tations, file it for future use. M uch has been learned about how to prepare healthful foods that are enjoyable, convenient to make, and economical",

    "content": "Many of the leading chefs of Europe and the United States have abandoned cooking styles that once depended on fats and oils and are now using healthier cooking methods. This “new” cuisine uses the cook's culinary skill to create delicious meals that bring fruits, vegetables, and grains to center stage. Simple yet innovative techniques can be used to modify favorite recipes to maximize the nutritious value of the meal without jeopardizing its taste. When you modify an existing recipe, it is generally best to start slowly, making one change at a time. Persistence, willingness to experiment, and a few tried-and-true hints can help you prepare healthful and flavorful meals. CHANGE IS GOOD Recently, fat, sugar, and salt have been vilified for the roles they play in increasing the risk of certain dis- eases such as obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and high blood pressure. However, they are only “bad” when eaten in excess. The key is not to banish them from the kitchen but to use them in moderation. Fat provides flavor, substance, and a mouth-pleasing creamy texture. Sugar adds sweetness, crispness, tenderness, and color. Salt heightens the flavor of foods and is necessary in baked goods made with yeast. C H A P T E r f i v e PREPARING HEALTHFUL MEALS As a start, try these five methods: • Reduce the amount of fat, sugar, or salt. • Delete a high-fat ingredient or seasoning. • Substitute a healthier ingredient. • Change the method used to prepare the recipe. • Reduce the amount of meat in the recipe. Can the Amount of an Ingredient Be Reduced? Start by reducing the amount one ingredient at a time. In most baked goods, sugar generally can be reduced by one- third to one-half without substantially changing consistency or taste. Because sugar increases moisture, as a rule retain one-fourth cup of sugar, honey, or molasses for every cup of flour in baked goods. To maximize the sweetness of foods, when appropriate, serve the dish warm or at room temperature rather than cold",

Eliminating a cup of sugar in a recipe saves about 800 calories. Fat also can be reduced by one-third to one-half in baked goods. Use puréed fruit or applesauce to replace the fat in a 1:1 ratio. For example, use one-half cup of oil plus one- half cup of unsweetened applesauce (instead of 1 cup of oil). Eliminating 1 cup of oil or fat saves about 2,000 calories and 225 grams of fat. Another way to decrease fat and cholesterol is to substitute egg whites or egg substitute for a whole egg. For every egg, use 2 egg whites or a quarter cup of egg substitute. With this replacement, approximately 5 grams of fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 200 milligrams of choles- terol, and 60 calories are saved. Reduce but do not totally remove salt because a small amount of salt frequently is required to facilitate the chem- ical reactions that occur during cooking. Salt is always required with yeast-leavened items. The cooler the food, the saltier it will taste. Try under-salting hot foods that will be chilled before serving. Using a half teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon in a recipe saves about 1,200 mil- ligrams of sodium. (See sidebar: Tips for Using Spices and Herbs, this page.) Can an Ingredient Be Omitted? Determine whether any ingredients can be omitted. Sugar, fat, and salt are likely candidates because in many instances they are used mainly for appearance or by habit. To reduce sugar, omit candy coatings, sugary frostings, and syrups. Nuts, although nutritious, are high in fat and contribute sig- nificant calories. Additional condiments that add unwanted fat and calories include coconut, whipped cream, mayon- naise, butter, margarine, and sour cream. Pickles, catsup, olives, and mustard are low in calories. However, because these condiments are high in salt, persons who have high blood pressure or heart disease generally should limit their use",

    "content": "Can a Substitution Be Made? Substituting ingredients that are lower in fat, sugar, and salt can make a significant difference in a recipe. For exam- ple, use skim milk rather than whole or 2 percent milk. Products made from pureed prunes and apples or mashed bananas often can be used as a replacement for butter, margarine, or oil. These products also can be used in homemade baked goods or box mixes. (See sidebar: Choose These Alternatives to Reduce Fat, Sugar, and Salt, page 127.) Be cautious when using fat-free spreads (such as fat- free margarine or cream cheese), “artificial” sweeteners, or salt substitutes in cooked foods. Most fat-free spreads contain a significant amount of water. This can change the outcome of the recipe by affecting its leavening or by leaving the food runny. Some sweeteners (such as aspartame) lose their sweetness when exposed to heat. Heat can make some salt substitutes (such as those containing potassium chloride) strong or bitter tasting. For these reasons, these products generally should be restricted to recipes that do not require cooking or are used as condiments when foods are 126 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition • Conversion: 1 tablespoon fresh herbs = 1 teaspoon dry = 1/4 teaspoon powdered • Use sparingly: 1/4 teaspoon per pound of meat or pint of sauce. You can always add more. • When doubling a recipe, add only 50 percent more seasoning. • Crush or rub dry herbs between your fingers to enhance flavor before adding them to a recipe. • In long-cooking entrées such as stews, add herbs toward the end of the cooking time. • In chilled foods such as dips, salads, and dressings, add herbs several hours before serving. • For maximal freshness, purchase herbs in small quantities and store in airtight containers away from light and heat. TIPS FOR USING SPICES AND HERBS served at the table. In most instances, success depends on patience and a bit of creativity. If one substitution does not yield the desired result, try again",

Would Another Cooking Method Be Healthier? The choice of cooking technique is important. If the usual method of cooking uses fat, try grilling, broiling, braising, or roasting the food instead. Instead of deep-fat frying, try oven baking. French “fries” seasoned with chili powder or oregano are both tasty and low in fat when baked. Although stir “frying” can be a healthful cooking technique, use of generous amounts of oil negates some of the possible benefit. Always measure the oil to be used or, better yet, replace it with wine or a broth that adds flavor but little fat and only a few calories. Cooking food for the proper time (avoiding overcooking) not only makes it taste better but also preserves nutrients",

    "content": "Broiling—Food is placed beneath the heat source; bast- ing may be needed. Grilling—Food is positioned above the heat source; basting may be needed. Microwaving—This is a quick way to cook food with little added liquid or fat. Poaching—Food is cooked in a liquid at the simmer- ing point. Oven roasting—Food is cooked in an uncovered pan by the free circulation of dry air, until the exterior is well browned. Steaming—Food is placed on a rack in a basket above boiling liquid. Food should not touch the liquid. Stir frying—Small pieces of food are cooked over high heat and constantly stirred. Use wine, broth, or fruit juice as the liquid instead of the traditional oil. Marinating food adds flavor and does not have to add fat. Some tips for successful marinating include piercing large cuts of meat, poultry, or fish with a fork to help the marinade permeate the food. Always marinate food in a glass or ceramic dish in the refrigerator. Never place the food in a metal container. Most marinades feature an acid base that may react with metal and change the flavor. Finally, a food safety tip: reserve some of the marinade before you put meat in it. Marinade that has been in contact with raw meat should not be used to baste meat, poultry, or fish during the last 15 minutes of cooking. If you plan to use leftover marinade as a table sauce, it must be boiled for 5 minutes to eliminate bacteria. There is more that can be done once the food is out of the oven or off the stove. Skim the fat off pan juices, stews, and soups. Instead of topping vegetables with butter or margarine, sprinkle them with lemon juice or herbs. Remove any visible fat (and any skin from poultry) before serving. No special, expensive equipment is needed to cook healthful foods. A good set of non-stick pans, a skillet, a roasting pan, a baking sheet, measuring cups and spoons, and sharp knives are enough to get you started. Quality, durability, ease of use, and cost should be the primary con- siderations when outfitting a kitchen",

    "content": "Can the Amount of Fruits, Grains, and Vegetables in the Recipe Be Increased? Increasing the amount of vegetables, grains, and fruits in a recipe can both improve taste and increase the nutritional quality of the food. For example, when cooking a soup or stew, use three times as many vegetables (by measure) as meat. Add generous portions of mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli, and green pepper to pizza. Make pizza even lower in fat and calories by omitting or decreasing the cheese. Alternatively, choose a lower-fat cheese, such as mozzarella (made from skim milk), and use less of it. If possible, eliminate the meat or add only a small amount of lean meat. If you are making your own crust, make it thin and use whole-grain flour. Pizza, if served with a salad and eaten in moderation, can be an enjoyable and nutritious meal. To get at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day, add them to foods that do not typically include these ingre- dients. For example, add chopped pieces of fruit or vegetables to rice, add fruit toppings to toast or pancakes, or top meats with chopped vegetables. For each serving of meat (a serv- ing is 2 to 3 ounces of meat), try to eat at least 1 serving each of fruit, vegetables, and grains. When possible, start your meal with a healthful salad. This often helps you decrease the amount of high-calorie food that you eat later in the meal. The more servings of grains, vegetables, or fruit, the better, because these are both filling and high in nutrients (see side- bar: Nutrition Boosters, page 129). CREATING HEALTHFUL MENUS Plan menus so that each meal complements what you plan to eat later in the day or what you have eaten earlier in the day. Include plant-based entrées as often as possible. Examples that can result in satisfying meatless meals include pasta with marinara sauce and lots of vegetables, stir-fried vegetables with tofu over rice, or lentil soup with a side dish containing grains, beans, or vegetables. Plant-based entrées can be tasty, filling, and nutritious",

    "content": "Plant-based entrées can be tasty, filling, and nutritious. When you choose to eat meat, fish, or poultry, remember that your goal is to eat 6 ounces or less per day. If you ate meat for lunch, appropriately decrease your dinner portion. Avoid red meats that contain a large amount of fat. Instead, emphasize poultry or fish. When you eat red meat, choose a “choice” grade and a cut from the loin or round, because these generally are the leanest types of meat. The skin on poultry holds in moisture and flavor during cooking. 128 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition However, the skin is high in fat and calories. Contrary to popular belief, the skin does not need to be removed before cooking. There is minimal fat absorption if the skin is left on. Just make sure to remove the skin before the poultry is eaten. Many fish are low in fat. Those that are not low in fat generally contain omega-3 fatty acids that may help prevent heart disease. However, remember, all fats are high in calories, so the less fat added during cooking, the better. Condiments and sauces can add nutrition and enhance flavor. Keep in mind, however, that some are high in fat, sodium, and calories (see Chapter 4, “On the Side,” page 86). An example of a high-fat sauce is gravy over mashed pota- toes. Instead, try sprinkling mashed potatoes with garlic or other herbs. When choosing a topping, look for a lower-fat alternative. If none are available, then use less of the original topping. Sliced, chopped, or puréed vegetables can make a nour- ishing low-fat condiment. Fruits are a delicious complement to almost any meal. They can top meats, enrich salads, or be served for dessert. A dessert can be a pleasant end to a healthful meal. However, a dessert should not be an “extra.” Be sure it is included in your overall meal plan. Make the dessert a bonus by emphasizing fruit, whole grains, and lower-fat items. If you do not have a recipe that emphasizes fruits and whole grains, look for one that can be readily modified",

If you plan to eat a dessert, take a small portion. If you are preparing a dessert for a special occasion, make just enough to serve you and your guests. Leftover dessert is a powerful temptation. With a little thought and planning, you know what foods to emphasize and what foods to limit. You are ready to make a commitment to improve the way you and your family eat.

The final step is to ensure that the food you serve is safe to eat. Bacteria in the Kitchen Approximately 7 million cases of food poisoning are reported every year in the United States. Many other cases are mis- taken for stomach flu or some other infection and therefore are never reported. Food poisoning can be a serious and potentially fatal illness. Fortunately, such severe cases are rare. Bacterial contamination of food can occur if food is handled improperly. Thus, food safety is of paramount importance. Kitchens are replete with chances for passing along the bacteria (germs) that cause food poisoning. It is the respon- sibility of the person preparing the meal to make certain that foods and utensils are washed properly. Unclean kitchen utensils can promote food poisoning by growing unwelcome bacteria (see sidebar: Sources of Bacteria, below)",

    "content": "Hand Washing Sometimes in the rush to prepare meals, it is easy to over- look one of the simplest and most important rules in food preparation: wash your hands before handling any food. Bacteria tend to accumulate on your hands, especially around the cuticles and under the fingernails. To actually kill the bacteria, it would take water so hot that it would harm your skin. At least 10 seconds of vigorous rubbing with soap or detergent and warm water is required to rid your hands of germs. You also should wash your hands during meal preparation if they become contaminated by the food you are handling. Cross-Contamination Cross-contamination can lead to food poisoning. If uncooked food has been on a plate or cutting board, that plate or cutting board could transfer a potentially infectious agent to any other food that comes in contact with it. Therefore, always use separate utensils, plates, and cutting boards for raw and cooked foods. Ensuring Food Safety Food safety begins as soon as you purchase the food. Ideally, perishable foods should be promptly taken home and immediately refrigerated or frozen. However, if you need to make a stop before reaching home, plan to store meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products in a cooler on ice. Always observe the refrigeration recommendations on packaged foods. To decrease the total amount of bacteria found on raw chicken and other poultry, thoroughly rinse, inside and out, under cold water. After a complete rinse, use hot water and soap to wash out the sink. Before freezing meat, poultry, or fish, divide it into the portion size that you will need to prepare one meal. When you need to cool a food that you have cooked, quickly transfer it to a shallow container. Cover it and refrigerate it immediately. Bacteria thrive at temperatures between 40° and 140° Fahrenheit, potentially doubling in number every 20 to 30 minutes. Therefore, the most important food safety rule in the kitchen is: Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold",

    "content": "Defrosting Food Thaw poultry, fish, and meat in the refrigerator. Defrosting at room temperature promotes thawing on the outside while the core remains frozen. The soft outer portion pro- vides a fertile site for bacterial growth. Instead, put frozen food in the refrigerator (which is cool but above freezing) 148 Part I: A Guide to Healthy Nutrition BACTERIA SOURCE SOLUTION Cutting boards Keep two on hand—one for meat and the other for produce or breads* Sponges, dish cloths, Change and wash frequently and towels Knives and utensils Use separate knives and utensils for raw and cooked foods.

Generously spray the surface and let it stand for several minutes. Rinse and dry with a clean towel. SOURCES OF BACTERIA 1 or 2 days before it is to be used. For faster thawing, run cold water over the item or use a microwave for quick defrosting. Marinade Savvy Marinate poultry, seafood, and meat in the refrigerator. To play it safe, set some of the marinade aside (to use for basting or as a sauce at the table) before adding it to the raw meat. Avoid using the liquid that the raw meat has been marinating in for basting. If you do, discontinue basting at least 15 minutes before the meat is done so that the marinade can be heated to a high enough temperature to kill any bacteria that may be present. Do not use the leftover marinade as a sauce unless it has not come in contact with the raw meat or you have boiled it for at least 5 minutes. Cooking Food Always be sure to cook recipes at the appropriate temper- ature. Cooking foods to an internal temperature of at least 160° Fahrenheit kills most dangerous bacteria. Uncooked or undercooked meat can harbor pathogens such as the notorious E. coli bacteria (see sidebar: Cooking It Safe, this page)",

Because this device cooks at relatively low temperatures—compared with the oven or stovetop—it is vital to exercise safe cooking habits. For example, thaw meat thoroughly and cut it into small pieces. Use recipes that call for plenty of liquid. Bring to a boil quickly and then reduce heat to simmer. Do not overfill the cooker. Be sure to use a thermometer to make certain the temperature stays at 160° Fahrenheit or higher. SERVING SAFELY After taking care to prepare and cook food as safely as possible, don’t contaminate it while it is being served. Here are a few tips. Avoid letting cooked foods cool on the table. Do not allow foods that contain perishable ingredients (such as raw eggs, homemade sauces, eggnog, or home- made Caesar dressing) to remain at room temperature for longer than a few minutes. Once finished serving, always promptly place cooked or perishable foods in the refriger- ator or freezer. At a picnic or party, keep cold foods on ice and hot foods properly heated. Dishes, serving bowls, or other items made of glazed lead-containing pottery can cause poisoning, particularly in young children. Make sure that the container that is used for cooking and serving is properly glazed (manufacture by a domestic pottery dealer should ensure this). If in doubt, use the pottery for decoration rather than for cooking or serving food. REFRIGERATING OR FREEZING FOOD If warm or hot food is headed for storage in the refrigerator or freezer, do not allow it to cool on the countertop. Place warm or hot food into a shallow pan to facilitate cooling and then put it directly into the refrigerator or freezer. If the quantity of food is large, distribute it in two or more containers to enable quicker cooling",

The healthiest diets are based on a variety of plant foods—whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts. Animal products and added fats and oils, sugars, and other sweeteners are best consumed in small quantities. The Food Guide Pyramid reviewed earlier in this book graphically emphasizes the proportions of these foods in the daily diet. Accordingly, we have arranged this section with priority given to grains, fruits, and vegetables—those items that should predominate at every meal and that most people need to consume in greater quantities. Animal products—meat and other high-protein foods and dairy foods—are also discussed. However, these are the foods that should make up relatively smaller parts of our diets. Part II introduces you to many foods from which you can choose and provides you with knowledge about the nutrients these foods have to offer",

    "content": "In addition, we provide informa- tion about the sources of the foods you purchase and eat—the individual plants and animals, how they are processed to the products that appear on store shelves, and some of the history of these foods in our diet. Before we introduce the foods themselves, we want to explain the arrangement and presentation of food items in these sections. Because this book is written for a North American audience, we have included food products that are available to most North Americans. Within the sections on Fruits and Vegetables, we have listed items by their common names in alphabetical order; when a food has more than one common name, the index should help in locating the item. Where there is a difference between the cultural or common use or perception of an item and its botanical nature, we have listed it according to common usage and mentioned the difference in the text. For example, although cucumbers, eggplant, squash, and tomatoes are botanically fruits, they are listed within the vegetable section, because most American consumers think of them as vegetables. The nutrient compositions of foods are derived from the current version of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrient composition database. This database is maintained and updated regularly by USDA laboratories and is the basis of most systems for estimating the nutrient content of foods and diets. 151 152 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods 153 Fruits O ur earliest ancestors built their diets entirely of vegetables, fruits, seeds, grains, legumes, and nuts. Throughout history, “fruit” has referred to any plant used as a food. More recently, “fruit” has come to mean the edible pulp or fleshy layer around a seed. In the 18th century, the word acquired a botanical definition: the organ derived from the ovary and surrounding the seed. At the same time, culinary custom defined fruits by their sweetness (or the balance of sweet to sour) and by how they are used in the meal, primarily as dessert",

    "content": "Thus, even though eggplant, cucumber, squash, and tomatoes are technically fruits, we call them vegetables. Until recently, the availability of a fruit during the year depended on its growing season. For example, strawberries appeared in April and May, melons in August and September, whereas some fruits, such as apples and bananas, were available year-round. Today, reliable transporta- tion brings fruit of every type to our markets year-round, although some imported fruits may be more costly during the winter than their domestic counterparts are in the summer when they are in season. The revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans includes as 1 of its 10 principles the advice to eat a variety of fruits (and vegetables) daily. (For a discussion of the Dietary Guidelines and the 5 a Day program, see Chapter 1, page 8.) To help you to be better informed and better plan your menus, this section provides information on the origin and nutrient content of many fruits. [(See the Appendix, page 434, for further information about the nutrient content of fruits.)] Fruit is a valuable source of fiber, vitamin C, some of the B vitamins, vitamin A, and other antioxidants and phytonutrients. (See the Appendix, Phytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484). The tables of nutrient values in the Fruits section are based on serving sizes specified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid. Nutrient values are rounded (milligrams and micrograms tend to be rounded to one decimal point, grams are rounded to whole numbers). Nutrient claim statements listed beneath the common name of each fruit are based on the serving size specified and the definitions in Chapter 4 (see sidebar: Nutrient Claims, page 92). For example, 1 medium apple is considered a good source of vitamin C, because an apple provides 13 percent of the Daily Value for vitamin C. A food that is high in a particular nutrient provides 20 percent or more of the Daily Value for that nutrient per serving",

Manoa Sweet, a variety developed in Hawaii, has orange-red fruits that are espe- cially sweet. A dwarf variety, which grows to a height of only 2 feet, can tolerate lower temperatures than the other varieties and is suited for container cultivation. Origin & botanical facts The acerola is believed to have originated in the Yucatán peninsula of Mexico. Since its discovery, the plant has been introduced throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, but it is still primarily grown in and around the West Indies. The acerola is a large, bushy shrub that can attain a height of 15 feet. Although the plant grows best in hot tropical low- lands with medium to high rainfall, it is also very drought-tolerant. Acerolas need protection against frost and winds because their root system is shallow and they can be toppled by high winds. The leaves are covered with hair, are light to dark green, and become glossy when mature. The small, white to pink flowers bloom throughout the year. Because up to 90 percent of the blossoms fall from the plant, only a few of the flowers set fruit. When grown from seed, plants begin to fruit after 2 or 3 years. An 8-year-old tree may yield 30 to 60 pounds of fruit a year. Uses Because acerolas deteriorate quickly and undergo rapid fermentation once removed from the tree, they should be refrigerated if not used immediately. Unrefrigerated fruits can develop mold within 3 to 5 days. Acerolas can be eaten raw, made into jams and jellies, or puréed into juice. They have been used as a supplemental source of vitamin C, to make baby food, and as an ingredient in ice cream. Nutrient composition Acerolas contain the most concentrated source of natural vitamin C of any known fruit, 100 times the vitamin C content of oranges and 10 times that of the guava. Green (unripe) fruits have twice the vit- amin C content of ripe fruits",

As a result, apples are avail- able in a seemingly endless array of colors, crispness, texture, size, sweetness, and aroma. Some of the more popular varieties in the U.S. marketplace are the Red and Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, and Rome Beauty. Origin & botanical facts The apple is native to Asia and eastern Europe. The earliest recorded descrip- tion of apples appears in Greek literature of the 4th century B.C. The first apples cultivated in the New World were grown from seed brought by the Pilgrims. Today, the leading apple-producing nations are Russia, China, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy",

Apples are a good source of dietary fiber in the form of pectin. Family Rosaceae Scientific name Malus pumila, Malus sylvestris, Pyrus malus Common name apple ♥Good source of pectin, a soluble fiber that helps reduce blood cholesterol ♥A good source of vitamin C The apple is a pome, a round fruit that consists of firm, juicy flesh covered by a thin, tough, edible skin and surrounding a cartilaginous, seeded core. The skin color of apples can range from dark green to yellow to bright red, or some combination of these colors. Apples that are just ripe are crisp and juicy, whereas those that are overripe attain an aromatic flavor and a slightly mealy texture. Apples can grow virtually anywhere with a moderate climate, although some varieties are better suited to a particular region. Because fruit-bearing seasons vary by variety and region, apples are available all year. Standard-sized trees reach a height and spread of 25 feet and require 5 to 10 years to fruit. Recently, dwarf and semidwarf trees have emerged; these require as few as 2 years to bear fruit. Uses When selecting apples, choose those with firm flesh and tight skin that is free of bruises, soft spots, and holes",

Dried apples make tasty snacks or additions to 156 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Varieties Approximately 12 varieties of apricots exist, with flesh that varies from yellow to deep orange. Some of the better known varieties are the Blenheim, the Tilton, the Patterson, and the Castlebrite. Origin & botanical facts The world’s leading producers of apricots are Turkey, Italy, Russia, and Greece. Ninety percent of the U.S. domestic market is supplied by growers in California; Utah and Washington supply the rest. During the off-season, apricots are imported from Chile and New Zealand. Apricot trees grow to about 20 feet in height and spread to a width of 30 feet. The white or pink flowers appear in early spring and give way to fruits in late summer. Because of this early flowering, apricot yield may be limited by late frosts that kill the flowers. The domestic crop is available from mid-May to mid-August, and imports arrive in December and January",

    "content": "Avocado SERVING SIZE: 1 medium (200 g) Varieties The two most commonly sold varieties of avocados in the United States are the Hass and Fuerte, both grown in California. The Guatemalan Hass avocado, the most popular variety, has a thick, pebble-tex- tured and purplish skin and usually weighs no more than 12 ounces. The Fuerte avocado, a Guatemalan-Mexican hybrid, has a more pronounced pear shape and is slightly larger than the Hass. It has a shiny, thin, dark-green skin with small, raised, pale spots. Florida-grown varieties, which are Mexican in origin and include the Booth, Waldin, and Lula, are larger, less costly, and more perishable than California avocados. In addition, they contain less fat and fewer calories and lack the rich, creamy flavor of the California varieties. Origin & botanical facts The avocado, native to the tropics and sub- tropics of Central America, was first cul- tivated in the United States in the mid- 1800s in Florida and California. Ninety percent of today’s domestic crop of avoca- dos is grown in California. With a har- vest of 168,000 tons, the United States is the second-largest grower of avocados in the world, behind Mexico at 718,000 tons. The avocado tree, a popular shade tree in rural and suburban Hawaii, California, and Florida, is a dense evergreen that may reach a height of 80 feet. Avocados do not ripen on the tree; ripening is inhibited by hormones pro- duced by the leaves. This delay in ripen- ing is a commercial advantage because the fruit may be left unharvested for long periods (up to 7 months). However, over- ripe avocados may seed internally and become moldy. Uses Avocados that are unblemished and heavy for their size are best. Ripe avocados yield slightly to finger pressure, but if the finger leaves a dent, the avocado may be over- ripe. Ripening can be hastened by enclos- ing the fruit in a paper bag and leaving at room temperature. Ripe avocados should be refrigerated and used within 1 to 2 days. Because cooking destroys the flavor of avocados, it is not recommended",

They can be diced and mixed into salads, mashed to use in toppings or dips, puréed to use in cold soups and desserts, or julienned to include in sushi rolls. When exposed to air, avocado flesh discolors quickly. Addition of lemon or lime juice to mashed or puréed avocados can delay discoloration. Placing an avocado pit in a bowl of mashed avocados will not prevent discoloration. Nutrient composition Avocados are known for their high fat content; however, most is monounsaturated fat.

Red bananas from Latin America are slightly wider and are heavier and sweeter than yellow bananas. Their red skin turns purple when ripe. Manzano bananas (also called finger or apple bananas) are short and chubby with a mild, strawberry-apple flavor. They turn fully black when ripe. Plantains (also called green or cooking bananas), thick-skinned bananas that range from green to yellow to brown-black, are a staple food in many parts of the world.

A banana tree is technically not a tree, but rather a tree-like herb that belongs to the grass family. It can attain a height of 10 to 40 feet when fully grown. The banana is actually a berry that has been cultivated to have no seeds. The non-woody banana stalk develops a flowering stem and seven to nine buds that each sustain one cluster (hand) of 10 to 20 bananas (fingers). The stalks are cut after producing the fruit, and new stems grow from buds in the rootstock. Uses Ripening of green bananas can be hastened by putting the fruit into a paper bag.

The term is loosely applied to a range of fruits belonging to vastly diverse botanical families. Aside from the more popular berries such as the blackberry, blueberry, cranberry, currant, raspberry, and strawberry, there are a host of less common species, each with its own distinctive shape, color, fragrance, and taste. Berries were a staple in the diets of our hunting-and-gathering ancestors and still play an important role in the culinary traditions of many peoples around the world. American Indians used various types of berries as food, medicine, dyes, and food preservatives. Early American settlers developed a taste for the many varieties growing wild in woods and fields of North America, and they learned to use the berries for food and medicine. Research has shown that several berries have medicinal properties. (Cranberries and blueberries help prevent urinary tract infections.) Most berries contain generous amounts of vitamin C, and some are a good source of fiber because of the skin and seeds",

Boysenberries, loganberries, ollalaberries, sylvanberries, and tayberries are hybrids of blackberries and raspberries. Blackberries are found throughout the temperate zones of the world, growing wild in meadows and at the edge of forests. The bushes flower in spring and bear fruit throughout the summer. Borne in loose clusters on stems that grow from the canes, the berries change from green to red and then to purplish black as they ripen. Blackberry bushes are so vigor- ously invasive that they are considered a weed in some areas. Plump, deeply colored blackberries are the most delicious to eat, and immature red berries are tart. Blackberries are best used immediately, because they spoil quickly. They can be lightly covered and refrigerated for 1 to 2 days. Blackberries can be eaten fresh; used as a topping for yogurt, ice cream, and pancakes; tossed into a fruit salad; puréed to make a dessert sauce; or made into blackberry pie. About 98 percent of commercially produced berries are processed into jams, fillings, juices, wines, and brandies. Blackberry Family Rosaceae Scientific name Rubus fructicosus (European), Rubus villosus (American) Common name blackberry, bramble berry, dewberry, goutberry Berries Also called bramble berries because they grow on thorny bushes (brambles), black- berries range from one-half to an inch long when mature and are purplish black. Like raspberries, to which they are related, blackberries are oblong and are made up of small edible seeds that are encased in juicy globules adjoining a fleshy base.

They can be eaten dried or fresh as a snack food; added to cereals, salads, yogurt, or ice cream; used as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, pies, breads, or sauces or as cake topping; or puréed to make jam or jelly. Although the blueberry season is short, berries can be bought in the off-season in frozen, canned, or dried form. Blueberries are a good source of vitamin C.

Cultivated blue- berries can be as large as 3/4 inch in diame- ter, although the “wild” varieties are only 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. At least 50 species of blueberries, both cultivated and wild, have been identified. The two types of cultivated blueberries are highbrush and rabbiteye. Highbrush blueberries, V. corymbosum L., are grown throughout North America, whereas the rabbiteye varieties, V. ashei Reade, are better adapted to southern regions of the United States. Lowbush (wild) blueberries, V. angustifolium Ait., grow naturally in Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. These plants produce blueberries that are prized for their intense flavor.

Blueberries have been used as a source of food and folk medicine for thousands of years. Early explorers of North America, such as Lewis and Clark, noted that American Indians smoked the berries to pre- serve them for winter and pounded the berries with beef to make a jerky called pem- mican. Blueberries were also appreciated by the early American settlers as both a food and a medicine. The blueberry plant is a compact, woody shrub that is related to the bilberry, cranberry, and huckleberry. Blueberries grow in clusters, but because the berries ripen at different times, they must be handpicked to harvest the best of the early fruit. Later, a harvesting machine is used to gently shake each bush so that only the ripe berries fall off. The blueberry sea- son lasts only from mid-April to late September, beginning in the southern states and moving north as the season maroon. About one-third of an inch in diameter and half-inch to an inch long, the cranberry has seeds that are attached to the center of the fruit and are surrounded by a tart white pulp. Also called bounceberries, because they bounce when ripe, cranberries belong to the same family as blueberries and huckleberries; but unlike these fruits, cranberries are too tart to eat raw. Cranberries are divided into three types. The most common is the large Vaccinium macrocarpon, grown for com- mercial purposes. Vaccinium oxycoccus, commonly called the mossberry or small cranberry, is found wild in some areas. Vaccinium vitis-idaea, or the lingonberry, grows well in very cold climates and is currently being developed as a crop in several eastern European countries. Cranberries grow on a flat, woody, evergreen “vine” that thrives in acidic soil. Cranberry vines are planted in peat bogs prepared in a way that allows the plants to be covered with water to protect them from cold damage",

Currants prefer cold climates, heavy, moist, enriched soil, and full sun or light shade. Although they can be propagated by seed in the spring or by cuttings in the early fall, bushes grown from seed produce no fruit for 2 to 3 years.

The White Imperial, a small, round, white berry that grows on a spreading bush, has the lowest acid content of any currant. The most common pink currant is the Gloire des Sablons, an ancient French variety with pink flesh and colorless skin. The Boskoop is a well-flavored black currant, produced on a vigorous, upright bush. The Willoughby is a mild, black Canadian currant that is hardy to cold and sun and resists mildew. Currants appear to have originated in northern Europe, northern Africa, Siberia, and in the Western Hemisphere, where they were eaten by American Indians well before their first contact with Europeans. American Indians historically have used currants for both food and medicinal purposes. The Coast Salish Indians of Vancouver Island boiled the fruit and dried it into rectangular cakes for use as a win- ter food. The Woodlands Cree Indians used currant jam as a condiment for fish, meat, and bread. Before 1550, the English called this fruit ribes, a name of ancient Indo-European origin. Subsequently, the berries came to be called currants, a word derived from the berry’s resemblance to the dried Greek raisins that are made from small seedless grapes. English and European colonists in the Americas found currants growing wild in woods and fields and quickly developed a taste for them. Today, currants are commonly cultivated in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Europeans and Canadians seem to prefer black currants, and the less tart red and white varieties are more pop- ular among Americans.

Three years is required for the bushes to begin produc- ing the delicate white flowers from which the berries form on erect stalks or canes. Mature berries must be handled carefully because they are fragile and easily damaged. Some are packed in small containers for the fresh market, but the bulk of the har- vest is processed into frozen, concentrated, or canned forms. Raspberries are best eaten within 1 to 2 days of purchase.

After the flowers are pollinated, they and their fleshy bases swell and become succulent and full of juice, like the drupes of a blackberry, which the mulberry resembles in size and shape. There are three principal species, the names of which refer not to the color of the fruit but to the color of the buds. The black mulberry (M. nigra) is native to western Asia and has been grown in Europe and the Middle East since ancient times for its fruits. Large, juicy, and bluish black, the black mulberry is no doubt the most flavorful, with its refreshing com- bination of sweetness and tartness. The American, or red, mulberry (M. rubra), indigenous to the eastern United States, grows wild from Massachusetts to the Gulf Coast. Usually a deep red-purple, the red mulberry is not as tasty as its black cousin. The white mulberry (M. alba) is the least tasty of the three, with an unpleasant sweetness that lacks the pleasing tartness of the black mulberry. The plant is native to eastern and central China, where the tree has long been cultivated for its leaves, Raspberries are small aggregate fruits, composed of numerous, small drupelets, each containing a small seed and clustering together around a central core",

The plant itself is a low-grow- ing perennial that produces horizontal runners, or stolons, that spread out from the base and take root to form new plants. The hundreds of varieties of straw- berries in the United States, which vary in size, color, and taste, are distinguished primarily by their locale. Some California varieties include Chandler, Selva, Seascape, and Camaroso. Florida vari- eties include the Florida 90, with large, red, flavorful fruit; the Tioga, a large, vigorous plant with medium-quality berries; the Florida Belle, a disease-resis- tant variety with red, conical fruit; and the Sequoia, with high-quality fruit that tends to be soft when ripe.

American Indians are known to have cultivated strawberries by the 17th century to eat fresh and also dried and added to winter soups. They also used them medicinally, to make dyes, and as preservatives for other food. In the early 18th century, the French developed larger strawberries by crossing two wild varieties. These plants are believed to be the source of the large cultivated strawberries we enjoy today. Although the source of the name “strawberry” is unknown, it may derive from the practice of placing straw around the plants for protection, from the runners that the plant sends out, or from the Anglo-Saxon verb “to strew,” which could have led to names such as strea- bergen, streberie, straibery, and, finally, the English strawberry. Strawberries prefer well-drained, moist, sandy soils, warm days, and cool nights. The flowers, usually white but sometimes pink, give rise to berries that ripen about a month after the blossoms form. Most varieties of strawberry con- tinue to bloom and produce fruit throughout the harvest season. The fruit is picked at the peak of its freshness and does not ripen after harvesting. Because strawberries are easily bruised, they are carefully hand-picked, sorted, and packed in the field and then rushed to cooling facilities. They are stored for only 24 hours before being shipped in refrigerated trucks to markets. In California, where strawberries have been cultivated since the early 1900s, the fruit grows 10 months of the year, from January through November; the peak season falls between April and June. In fact, California produces more than 80 percent of all domestic strawberries, about 1 billion tons per year. In Florida, the second-largest producing state, straw- berries are grown in the winter months only, and Oregon cultivates berries mostly for frozen products",

Breadfruit grows in hot, wet, tropical lowlands, tolerating a variety of well- drained soils. The fruit is propagated from shoots that develop from the tree’s roots, or from root cuttings themselves. The tree produces an extensive root system, so it must be planted where it will have room to grow. It does not transplant easily. Trees bear fruit 5 to 7 years after the shoots are planted, and generally two crops of fruit mature during the year, once between April and June, and once between October and January. Breadfruit must be harvested by hand, by climbing the tree and cutting or snap- ping off the stem close to the branch. If knocked from the tree, bruises will cause rapid softening. Because individual bread- fruits do not develop at the same rate, each tree must be harvested several times during the season. Uses Breadfruit that is slightly soft with a yellow to tan rind and no bruises should be chosen.

The fruit was brought to Florida from Panama via Chile in the late 1800s. It is cultivated in Florida and in California and is mostly recognized for its ornamental value. According to ancient Chinese beliefs, a flourishing calamondin tree will bring good luck to the household. Unlike many of its cousins in the citrus family, it is able to withstand mild cold tempera- tures. However, it thrives best in filtered sunlight and acidic soil at temperatures ranging between 60° and 85° Fahrenheit. Excess moisture may damage its roots. The dwarf tree produces very decorative, fragrant white flowers about an inch in diameter, and it is valued as an ornamen- tal houseplant whose beauty lasts through the year. Its golden fruits can take up to 12 months to mature and ripen. Uses Aside from its use as a garnish, cala- mondin is appreciated for its distinctive flavor. The entire fruit, except for the seeds, can be consumed. The fruit is best used within a week of harvesting when it is still green. Once it reaches deep yellow, it must be kept refrigerated to retain its crispness and aroma. The fruit can be kept refrigerated up to 2 weeks. This tiny fruit releases a highly acidic (almost caustic in taste) juice that works wonderfully as a flavor enhancer in a variety of dishes, from fish to noodles, soups, sauces, and desserts. It also is used to make preserves. Calamondin juice serves as a base in many beverages. Calamondin, also called “acid orange,” is a citrus fruit resembling a miniature orange. It is a slightly oblong fruit about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The edible peel is smooth and tender and varies in color, ranging from yellowish green when premature to deep orange when ripe.

The fruit is extremely sour but can also be very bitter if picked before maturity. Varieties Calamondin is one of several hundred subspecies of the genus Citrus. It belongs to the family that includes lemons, limes, and kumquats. Cross-breeders believe that it may be a hybrid of lime and man- darin. Others think it resembles a cross between the kumquat and the tangerine. It is a close relative to the “kalamansi,” also known as “musk lime,” which is used extensively in southeast Asian cuisine. 168 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Varieties Two types of carambola are available: the tart varieties and the sweet. The leading commercial variety, the Arkin, is sweet and has a bright-yellow to yellow-orange skin and flesh. Another common variety is the Golden Star, a fruit that is slightly larger than the Arkin and mildly tart. Other varieties include the Fwang Tung, Hoku, Kaiang, Maha, Sri Kembanqan, Wheeler, Thayer, and Newcombe. Origin & botanical facts The carambola has been cultivated in southeast Asia for many centuries and is thought to have originated in what is now Sri Lanka or in Malaysia. The carambola was introduced into Florida around 1887, and later Hawaii. Currently, the major suppliers worldwide include Taiwan, Malaysia, Guyana, India, the Philippines, Australia, and Israel.

The leaves are spirally arranged on the branch and are sensitive to light and sudden movements (they fold up during the night or when the tree is abruptly shaken). Although classified as a subtropical plant, the tree can tolerate short periods of frost with little damage. If picked before ripening, green carambola fruit eventually turns yellow. However, the fruit is sweetest if allowed to ripen on the tree. Uses Carambolas are easily damaged, and it is best to choose fruits that are firm and shiny. The fruit can be refrigerated in a moderately humid area for about 3 weeks without damage or loss in fruit quality. When transferred to room temperature, fruits that have been picked before fully ripe will turn yellow. The sweet variety is generally eaten fresh, either whole or sliced. Juiced, preserved, dried, and canned ver- sions also are available. The tart variety is used for making jams. Before the fruit is served, the darker edge of the cells (or ridges) should be removed and the fruit sliced crosswise. The star-shaped sections are often used as garnishes for light summer entrées. Rubbing a very small amount of salt onto the exposed flesh will prevent the darkening that is caused by exposure to the air",

Bing and Lambert are popular dark-red, sweet cherries. Rainier and Royal Ann are sweet varieties that are golden with a slight touch of red. Sour cherries are smaller, softer, and more globular, and the best- selling varieties are Early Richmond, Montmorency, and Morello. Origin & botanical facts Named after the Turkish town of Cesarus where they were first cultivated, cherries are believed to have originated in north- eastern Asia. They were mentioned by Theophratus, a Greek philosopher and naturalist, in the History of Plants, written in 400 B.C. Currently, the United States produces about 90,000 tons of cherries annually, with Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Utah producing 70 percent of the nation’s crop. Worldwide, Europe is the leading producer. Cherries are related to other deciduous Sweet cherries are usually eaten fresh.

The most common type is “semisoft,” a well-known example of which is the large, flavorful Medjool from Morocco. Other “semisoft” varieties are the firm-fleshed, amber Deglet Noor and the small, golden Zahidi. The Barhi, Khadrawy, and Halawy are “soft” dates. “Dry” varieties contain relatively little moisture when ripe. Thus, the term “dry” does not mean “dehydrated” or “dried.” Origin & botanical facts Dates originated somewhere in the desert area that stretches from India to North Africa. Cultivation seems to have begun at least 8,000 years ago, when settlement began along the Jordan River and around the Dead Sea. Archaeological evidence indicates that cultivation of dates was well established by 3000 B.C. in what is now Iraq. The northern coastal region of the Middle East was originally called Phoenicia, a name that may be the source of the early Greek term for the date, phoenix",

Some of these original trees still stand in southern California and in Mexico. Today, although the Middle East supplies three- fourths of the world’s dates, much of the American demand is supplied by dates from California and Arizona. Seventy- five percent of California dates are of the Deglet Noor variety, but some Medjools are grown along the Colorado River. The date palm grows to about 100 feet in height. The tree itself can thrive in almost any warm climate, but fruit production requires a hot, dry environ- ment with an underground water supply.

Nearly all of the small quantity of frozen durian exported from Thailand is shipped to the United States, Australia, and Canada. The durian tree can reach a height of about 125 feet and may bear fruit twice a year. The crop is heaviest between June and August. The fruits take 3 months to develop. The yield increases with the age of the tree, beginning with 10 to 40 fruits during the 1st year, increasing to about 100 fruits during the 6th year, and commonly reaching a yield of 200 after the 10th year. Ripe fruits are usually allowed to fall and are collected daily. The fruits also may be harvested directly from the tree, a common practice in Thailand. Harvested fruits taste better and have a shelf life of 9 to 11 days, compared with 2 to 5 days when the fruit is allowed to drop from the tree. Uses Durian can be stored at room tempera- ture 2 to 5 days.

Fruit that is picked when it is still firm will ripen at room temperature, but feijoas are most flavorful when allowed to remain on the tree until they are ready to drop. Harvesting is accomplished by shaking the tree and letting the fruit fall onto a tarpaulin to prevent bruising. The feijoa, also called pineapple guava, is an oval fruit that grows up to about 3 inches in length. It has a thin, waxy, blue-green to olive skin that at times has a red or orange blush. The flesh is creamy white and somewhat granular and surrounds a translucent, jelly-like center that encloses 20 to 40 tiny, edible, oblong seeds. Feijoa has a fairly complex flavor that is often compared to that of pineapple but also contains hints of strawberry, guava, quince, and mint. Varieties Most varieties of feijoa cultivated today originated in Australia, New Zealand, or California. The Choiceana from Australia is a small to medium-sized fruit with a smooth skin and pleasant flavor. Selected from Choiceana seedlings, the Mammoth is a larger variety from New Zealand with thick, wrinkled skin. The most widely cultivated variety in California is the Coolidge, a small to medium-sized fruit with wrinkled skin and mild flavor. Origin & botanical facts The feijoa is native to South America, specifically the cool subtropical and trop- ical highland areas of southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plant was introduced to California in the 1890s, and even though the feijoa is not in great demand commercially, 1,000 acres in California are dedicated to its cultivation.

The fig is a pleasantly sweet fruit that consists of a soft flesh pursed around a large number of tiny edible seeds. It can be eaten whole, peeled or unpeeled. Under certain circumstances, the natural sugars crystallize on the surface of the fruit, making the fruit sweeter. Figs are small, about 1 to 3 inches long. The shape varies from plain round or oval to gourd shaped, and the color ranges from brown to purple-black to almost white. The fig’s origin has been traced to west- ern Asia and to Egypt, Greece, and Italy. Today, figs are found in all warm, dry climates, especially sunny areas of the Mediterranean. Rainy seasons are not favorable to the fruit’s development. Excess moisture can split the skin and accelerate decay. Figs were brought to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. The fruits arrived in California through Catholic missions and were plant- ed in areas around San Diego and Sonoma. The fig is a broad, irregular, picturesque deciduous tree that generally reaches 10 to 30 feet in height but can sometimes reach 50 feet. The leaves are large, bright- green, and hairy on both sides. Fig trees are valued for their shade. Fig tree blossoms do not appear on the branches. Instead, the flower grows inside the fruit, which is actually a flower that is inverted into itself. The seeds are actually underdeveloped, unfertilized ovaries of the real fruit which impart the resin-like flavor associated with figs. Because figs will not continue to ripen after harvest, they must be allowed to ripen fully on the tree. Because fresh figs are delicate, highly perishable, and very sensitive to cold, 90 percent of all har- vested figs are dried",

Both are grown in the United States, but the European varieties are the more popular. Most American grapes (such as the Concord) are slip-skin types, meaning that the skins slide off easily, whereas the skins of most European grapes cling tightly to the flesh. Grapes are classified by whether they have seeds or are seedless. They also can be clas- sified by their uses, such as for the making of wine (such as cabernet), for commercial foods (such as concord grapes for jelly), or for eating at the table (such as Thompson). Origin & botanical facts Grapes are among the oldest cultivated fruits. Fossil evidence indicates that grapes were consumed, and possibly cultivated, as early as 8,000 years ago near what is now northern Iran, between the Black and Caspian seas. In precolonial America, native grapes (Vitis girdiana) grew wild along the banks of rivers and streams, but these grapes were very sour.

Uses The softest, yellowest guavas, free of blemishes, are best for purchase. They can be ripened at room temperature and refrigerated in a perforated plastic bag. Mature but green guavas can be kept refrigerated for several weeks and will ripen at room temperature in 1 to 5 days. The ripening process can be accelerated by placing the fruit in a paper bag. Ripe fruit that has changed color should be eaten within a couple of days because it will bruise easily and rot quickly. The just-ripened fruit is crisper in taste than the fully ripe fruit. Guavas can be frozen for extended periods of storage. The flesh of the guava can be eaten with a spoon or peeled and sliced. Puréed guava is used as a marinade or a dessert sauce or to make smoothies or sorbet. Commercially, guava is often made into juice. Nutrient composition Guavas are a good source of vitamin A (beta-carotene) and are rich in vitamin C, although much of the vitamin C is in the rind of the fruit. Guavas are also high in dietary fiber and contain lycopene, a carotenoid with antioxidant properties. Fruits 179 Varieties A relative of breadfruit, jackfruit comes in two main varieties. One variety has a fibrous, soft, sweet flesh with a texture similar to that of raw oysters. The other, more commercially important, variety is crisp and almost crunchy with a flavor that is not quite as sweet. This latter variety is more palatable to western tastes. Origin & Botanical Facts Believed to be indigenous to the rain forests of India, the jackfruit has spread to other parts of India, southeast Asia, the East Indies, the Philippines, central and eastern Africa, Brazil, and Suriname. Although adapted to humid tropical and near-tropical climates where it can reach the size of a large eastern oak, the mature jackfruit can withstand bouts of frost, unlike its cousin, the breadfruit",

Recently, they have been crossed with limes and oranges to create limequats and orangequats. The calamondin, another small, orange-like fruit used in Philippine cooking, may be a cross between the kumquat and the mandarin orange. Uses Kumquats that are plump, not shriveled, should be chosen. Kumquats are deli- cious eaten fresh and whole. Because the skin is also edible, the fruit should be washed before eating. The bright-orange fruits, fresh, candied, or preserved in syrup or brandy, also make an attractive decoration for cakes and other desserts. Kumquats soaked for several months in a mixture of vodka and honey are used as a garnish or snack.

They may have been grown in the Mediterranean region as early as the 1st or 2nd century, because they appear in Roman artwork of the period. From there, they were brought to the rest of Europe about the time of the Crusades.

Four decades later, lime production ceased after a damaging freeze in the 1890s but under- went a resurgence after World War I. The lime tree is small and crooked with thorny branches. Like its cousins in the citrus family, the tree produces small white flowers that later become the fruits. In the United States, lime trees grow best in the southern states.

The pulp is pale green and is divided into 10 to 12 segments. The fruit has an aromatic taste but is too tart for eating out of hand. Its primary use is to flavor other foods. Varieties The many varieties of lime are nearly iden- tical in shape and appearance, but their degree of acidity ranges from nearly neutral to extremely tart. Among the high-acidity varieties are the small Mexican or Key lime, which has a sweet-tart taste. The Tahitian lime comes in two strains, the Persian and Bears, all of unknown origin and nearly seedless. These limes are grown commercially in California and the coastal areas of Florida. The Rangpur lime is highly acidic and is somewhat different in appear- ance from the others, with its pale-yellow peel, orange-red pulp, and green cotyledons. It is very seedy but has ornamental value. The Palestine “sweet” lime, less acidic than the others, also grows in south Florida. Origin & botanical facts Limes may have originated in Asia, in the vicinity of India, Burma, and Malaysia.

Origin & botanical facts The longan is native to southern China, where it remains a popular fruit. In 1903, theUnited States Department of Agriculture introduced the Chinese varieties of the longan to Florida, and cultivation was brought to Bermuda, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Today the longan is cultivated throughout southeast Asia, in Central America, and in the United States, where the leading producers are Hawaii and Florida. The longan tree is a tropical to sub- tropical evergreen that can reach heights of up to 35 feet and widths to 45 feet. Although it prefers warm weather, the mature tree can tolerate brief exposure to temperatures slightly below freezing. The tree’s large leaves, up to a foot long, create a dense, dark green foliage. The tree blooms once a year with small, greenish yellow flowers. The fruit develops in large, drooping clusters over about a 4- month period. Even in the best growing conditions, fruit yield can be erratic. The tree is propagated easily from seed, but because the tree must be 6 to 9 years old before bearing fruit (and even then the quality is not predictable), commercial propagation is usually accom- plished by air layering or grafting",

Nutrient composition Loquats are high in vitamin A. The loquat tree is a large evergreen that belongs to the same family as the apple, peach, and plum and can grow up to 30 feet in height. Easy to grow, the plant is often used as an ornamental plant because its long, boldly textured, dark-green leaves add a tropical look to the garden. Small white flowers with a sweet fragrance bloom in fall or early winter, and the fruits appear in clusters in early spring",

The white-fleshed varieties are better adapted to cool coastal areas than are the orange- fleshed types. Today, loquats are grown in China, Japan, India, Central and South America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the United States, where the leading producers are California and Florida. Worldwide, Japan is the leading producer, followed by Israel and Brazil. Because fresh loquats bruise and perish easily, they usually are found only in the regions where they are grown.

Its leaves are pale green with tinges of pink when young, and they turn dark green and leathery when mature. In spring, large sprays of yellowish green flowers cover the trees. For the best flavor, fruits should ripen on the trees approxi- mately 60 to 90 days. The tree requires moist, well-drained soil and a climate that is cool and dry for several months pre- ceding flowering and hot and humid for the rest of the year. Most of the world production of lychee is concentrated in Asia, with Taiwan being the leading exporter. Australia, Israel, Mexico, and the United States also produce lychees. American production is concentrated in Florida, Hawaii, and California. Uses Although lychees are usually eaten fresh in tropical countries, the canned versions are more often found in U.S. markets. Fresh lychees should be brightly colored and full (not shriveled) with shells that are intact and free of blemishes and with the stem still attached. The fruits can be placed in a plastic bag and stored in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Lychees can be eaten on their own, sprinkled with lemon or lime juice, or combined with berries and other fruit in a salad.

Melons were introduced by the Spanish Moors to most of Europe and were later introduced to the Americas in the late 15th century. The cantaloupe is thought to be named either for Cantaloup, a village in southern France, or Cantaluppi, a papal summer residence near Rome, Italy. The true cantaloupe is a European melon that is not exported to the United States, and American “cantaloupes” are actually a type of muskmelon.

Origin & botanical facts Although the papaya is native to southern Mexico and Central America, it is now grown in every tropical and subtropical country. Brazil is the leading producer of papayas in the world, dominating exports to Europe. Mexico is the largest supplier of papayas to the United States and Canada. The United States crop is con- centrated in Hawaii and is used to supply papayas to Japan and Canada. Technically an herb, the papaya tree can grow to 10 or 12 feet in height. Mexican varieties are usually taller",

Each fruit develops from a single fragrant flower that is 2 to 3 inches wide with green and white petals. The fruits quickly turn from green to purple (or yellow) when ripe and fall to the ground within a few days. They can be picked from the vine when ripe or harvested off the ground. Uses When ripe, passion fruits are heavy with wrinkled skin. Fruits that are heavy and firm should be chosen. Unripe fruits can be left at room temperature to ripen.

The yellow pulp has a jelly-like consistency and contains many edible grape-sized, flesh-covered, black seeds that are somewhat like those of a pomegranate. The pulp’s flavor is sweet-tart and lemony, and it is highly fragrant. Varieties With more than 400 varieties, about 30 of which are edible, passion fruits are divided into three main categories: pur- ple passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims), yellow passion fruit (P. edulis f. flavicarpa Deg.), and giant granadilla (P. quadrang- ularis L.). The purple varieties bear dark purple to black fruits that are about 2 inches long. The yellow varieties bear slightly longer (about 2 1/2 inches) deep- yellow fruits. Less commonly found are fruits of the giant granadilla varieties, which can reach 8 inches in length. Origin & botanical facts Passion fruit is native to the South American tropics. Spanish missionaries, upon discovering the plant in South America, are said to have given the fruit its name, because its flowers resembled instruments of the Passion and crucifix- ion of Christ, such as the crown of thorns, hammers, and nails",

Because of the hard seed, or “stone,” at their core, they are known as a “stone fruit,” or drupe. The fuzzy skin of peaches is the only characteristic that distinguishes them in appearance from the smooth-skinned nectarine. Ripe peaches can assume a range of colors from creamy-white to light-pink, yellow, orange, and red. The flesh also can range from a pinkish white to an intense yellow-gold. The firmness and juiciness of a peach depend largely on variety and on the degree of ripeness. Varieties Peaches are generally classified into one of two categories: “freestone” or “cling- stone,” although some are also considered “semi-freestone.” Freestone peaches, the ones more commonly available, are those whose pits are easily removed, whereas the pit of clingstones is enmeshed within the flesh. Both freestone and clingstone peaches have numerous varieties that differ in skin color, flesh color, firmness, and juiciness. Two of the most popular varieties of yellow-fleshed freestone peaches are Elegant Lady and O-Henry. Other varieties include the Hale, Rio Oso Gem, and Elberta. Origin & botanical facts A native of China, where they have been grown for more than 2,500 years, peaches were once revered as a symbol of longevity and immortality.

In the United States, the four main varieties are the Bartlett, Anjou, Bosc, and Comice. The Bartlett, the most popular summer pear, is the principal variety used for canning and the only variety sold dried. Bartletts are large, juicy, fragrant, and sweet and turn from dark-green to golden-yellow when ripe. A red-skinned strain called the Red Bartlett is also available. Blander in taste are Anjou pears, which are oval with smooth yellow-green skin and a creamy flesh. The Anjou is the most abundant winter pear. Bosc pears have dull, reddish brown skin and very firm flesh. Reputedly the most flavorful and sweetest variety is the Comice, which is squat in shape with dull-green skin. A variety that is growing in popularity is the Asian pear (also known as the Oriental pear, Chinese pear, or Japanese pear).

Sliced pears should be sprinkled with lemon juice to prevent browning. Nutrient composition Raw pears (with the skin on) are a good source of vitamin C and dietary fiber. Origin & botanical facts Native to the northern regions of central Asia, pears have been cultivated for more than 3,000 years. Pear trees were intro- duced to North America by the early colonists, who brought cuttings from European stock. The largest producers of pears today are China, Italy, Russia, and the United States. California, Oregon, and Washington account for 98 percent of the United States pear crop. Pears are closely related to apples in that both are pome fruits (fruits with a distinct seed- containing core) and members of the rose family. However, pear trees tend to be more upright than apple trees (commer- cially grown trees are usually pruned to about 20 feet high). Ideal growing con- ditions require a combination of warm days, cool nights, rich volcanic soil, and ample water. Between 100 and 170 days are required from bloom to harvest. Like bananas and avocados, pears are usually picked before they are fully ripe, because they do not ripen well on the tree. Pears are bell-shaped fruits, wide and round at the bottom, narrowing toward the stem; however, some varieties are nearly round. Pears range in size from less than 1 inch to 3 inches in diameter. They have a smooth, thin skin that may be green, yellow, brown, or red when ripe. The juicy, sweet flesh is usually white with a tinge of yellow",

The astringent type is inedible until it ripens and becomes soft, and the non-astringent type can be eaten while it is underripe and crisp. The astringent varieties are har- vested while still firm and allowed to ripen fully and soften. Astringent persimmons can ripen off the tree when stored at room temperature. Non-astringent varieties are harvested when they are fully colored and ripe. Persimmons are also divided into two classes by their origin: Japanese and American. Although Japanese per- simmons exist in both astringent and non-astringent varieties, they tend to be less astringent than American. The most common variety of persimmon available in the United States is the Hachiya, an astringent Japanese persimmon that is large and acorn-shaped. A popular non- astringent Japanese variety is the Fuyu, which is smaller than the Hachiya and shaped like a tomato.

Origin & Botanical Facts The Oriental persimmon, cultivated for centuries in China and later brought to Japan and Korea, was introduced to California in the 1870s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture imported persimmon trees to Florida and Georgia. In contrast, native persimmons have flourished over much of what is now the continental United States for centuries. American Indians dried the fruit to eat throughout the winter. The Oriental persimmon is a droop- leafed deciduous tree that can attain a height and width of about 25 feet. Because the tree is relatively cold-sensitive, it is grown only in the Deep South. The native persimmon can reach heights of 30 to 40 feet and is more tolerant of poor soils and cold than the Oriental type. Oriental persimmon trees are self- pollinating and also can produce seedless fruits from unfertilized flowers. The incon- spicuous flowers are cream-colored or pink. The fruit is in season from October to February. Native persimmons are not self- pollinating. Their flowers range from white to yellow and appear in May. The fruit appears in September, but it does not ripen until the weather cools. Oriental and native varieties cannot cross-pollinate. The persimmon, sometimes called the “apple of the Orient,” is a spherical or acorn-like, smooth-skinned fruit that ranges from a light yellow-orange to a brilliant orange-red.

Nutrient composition Pineapple is high in vitamin C and contains phytochemicals that promote health. with large, waxy, pointed leaves. Each plant bears one fruit in the center, and each pineapple is actually the result of the fusion of many individual fruits. Unlike most other fruits (with the exception of some melons), pineapples do not have a reserve of starch that converts to sugar after harvest. Instead, the starch is stored in the stem of the plant and enters the fruit as sugar just before it ripens completely. As a result, the fruit will not become any sweeter after harvest, so growers must allow the pineapple to ripen on the plant to maximize the sugar and juice content of the fruit. Uses When selecting a pineapple, choose one with fresh, green leaves and no obvious soft or brown spots, especially at the base. When ripe, the rind can be dark green, yellow, or reddish yellow; however, most pineapples on the market are already ripe, regardless of their color, and should be refrigerated in a plastic bag after purchase",

It has a waxy, tough rind covering a juicy flesh that surrounds a fibrous core. The flesh and core range from nearly white to yellow, and the flavor is a combination of apples, strawberries, and peaches.

Their skin color is always blue or purple, and their pits are usually freestone, which means that they separate easily from the flesh. Among the better- known varieties are Italian, President, Empress, Stanley, and Tragedy. In the United States, the bulk of European plums are grown in the Pacific Northwest, but some varieties are successfully culti- vated in the eastern states. With its firmer flesh and higher sugar and acid contents, the European variety is best suited for prunes (also called dried plums). The most common variety of plum used for prunes is the California French, also known as d’Agen. A few varieties of prune plums are sold fresh and are called fresh prunes or purple plums. Origin & botanical facts Although plums are native to several tem- perate regions around the world, including North America, early colonists brought European varieties with them that sup- planted native American plums. In the late 19th century, dozens of varieties from Europe and Asia were cultivated in the United States, primarily in California. One of the most influential plum breeders was the famed horticulturist Luther Burbank, who in 1907 developed the Santa Rosa variety, which now accounts for about a third of the total domestic crop. The California French plum is a descendant of the first prune plums brought to California from France by Louis Pellier in the 1850s. The domestic plum season extends from May to October, beginning with the Japanese vari- eties and ending with the European types. Today, about 70 percent of the world’s prune supply and nearly 100 percent of domestic prunes come from California. Uses The majority of plums are eaten fresh.

The tree bears small, ball-shaped white flowers borne on slender stalks at the leaf bases. A resinous sap called “chicle” was once collected from sapodilla tree trunks for making chewing gum. This practice has largely been replaced by the use of syn- thetic ingredients. The mature sapodilla tree can yield from 2,000 to 3,000 fruits in a single year. Because the fruits are easily perishable and fragile, they do not ship well and therefore are relatively unknown outside their areas of origin. Uses Because the high tannin and latex contents of unripe fruits make them astringent and unpalatable, sapodillas should be eaten only when ripe. Unripe sapodilla fruits should be left to ripen at room tempera- ture and refrigerated after ripening. The sapodilla is best eaten raw and chilled, by cutting in half and spooning the pulp out of the skin. It can be added to salads or desserts such as ice cream and sorbet. In Malaysia, the fruit is stewed with lime juice or fried with ginger. In India, it is eaten as a dried fruit. The sapodilla is nearly round and about 2 to 4 inches in diameter. Its thin, brownish skin is easy to peel when the fruit is ripe. The translucent flesh has a sweet flavor reminiscent of honey and apricots and a “melt in the mouth” texture",

Meat, fish, and poultry can be marinated in tangerine juice before grilling, and tangerine juice poured over freshly sliced fruit helps keep the fruit from turning brown and adds a distinctive flavor. Tangerines also make an excellent marmalade. Nutrient composition Although tangerines have about 43 percent less vitamin C than oranges, they are still an excellent source for this vitamin. Tangerines also contain more vitamin A (carotenes). The tangerine is a citrus fruit, usually round and about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, smaller than the orange. Its rough, fragrant rind is generally orange or red-orange, thin, and loose on the fruit, so that it peels very easily. Inside, numerous fibers loosely hold the 8 to 15 easily separated segments, or carpels, that contain the juice sacs and white seeds. The center is hollow. Although the terms “tangerine” and “mandarin orange” are sometimes used interchangeably, tangerines actually are a subgroup of the mandarin. were crossed with other citrus fruits, pro- ducing numerous hybrids such as the tangelo (a cross between a tangerine and a grapefruit) and the tangor (a hybrid of a tangerine and an orange). The tangerine tree is an evergreen that grows to a height of about 10 feet. The five-petaled tangerine blossoms are white and fragrant. It takes 6 to 10 months from the time the blooms appear until the fruit is ready for harvest",

Tangerines grow year-round in warmer climates, and they are a traditional Christmas or New Year treat in some parts of the world. Uses Tangerines are always picked when they are ripe, so they are ready for immediate consumption. Fruits should be heavy for their size and free of bruises. Color is not a reliable indicator of the quality of tan- gerines. The fruit is most often eaten as a snack or dessert or used in green salad or fruit salad. Tangerine slices also make an attractive garnish for cakes and other desserts. Freshly squeezed tangerine juice Varieties The most popular variety of tangerine in the United States is the Dancy, a very sweet fruit with a red-orange color and a mellow flavor. Honey tangerines, with their slightly green-tinged peel, are true to their name. They have a high sugar content and a rich taste. The Fallglo is a large tangerine with dark-orange rind and flesh. Two smaller sized varieties are the Clementine, also called the Algerian tan- gerine, and the Sunburst, which has a thin skin and deep-orange flesh. Origin & botanical facts Tangerines are native to China, but today they are grown all over the world. In the United States, the leading producers are California, Arizona, and Florida. The name “tangerine” is derived from the ancient, walled Moorish town of Tangier in northern Morocco, where the fruit grows in abundance.

    "content": "The plant foods that we call vegetables came under cultivation later than the grains and legumes. Less protein- and carbohydrate-dense than the grains and legumes, vegetables have always served more as accompaniments or accessory ingredients than as staples. Some fragrant, highly flavored vegetables, such as scallions, garlic, ginger, parsley, basil, oregano, fenugreek, and dill, are really used as herbs and spices in sparing amounts as flavorings for other foods. Only a few of these “vegetables” are described in this section. Other herbs and spices are discussed on pages 363 to 375. Some plant foods that we consider vegetables are, botanically, fruits (for example, avocado, squash, cucumber, olives, tomatoes, and eggplant), that is, edible flesh surrounding seeds. Nevertheless, the term “vegetable” has come to denote plant foods eaten as side dishes or used in the preparation of any part of the meal except dessert. Vegetables tend to be less sweet than foods considered fruits. In addition, some foods that are served as vegetables are really grains (corn), legumes (green beans, lima beans, peas), or fungi (mushrooms, truffles). So what is a vegetable, really? A vegetable is essen- tially any edible part of the plant (leaves, roots or tubers, and stalks) except, in most cases, the fruit. Multiple parts of some plants are eaten as separate vegetables with very different nutrient contents. The most common example is beet roots and their greens. Vegetables contribute significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, soluble and insoluble fiber, and other phytonutrients to our diets. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise us to eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruits every day, because the nutrient content varies considerably from one to another. (For a discussion of the Dietary Guidelines and the 5 a Day program, see Chapter 1, page 8.) With the exception of olives and avocados, which are really fruits, few vegetables, by themselves, provide significant amounts of fat",

To assist you in menu planning, the following section provides information regarding the nutrient content of many vegetables. The tables of nutrient values are based on serving sizes specified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid. Nutrient values are rounded (milligrams and micrograms tend to be rounded to one decimal point, grams are rounded to whole numbers). Nutrient claim statements listed beneath the common name of each vegetable are based on the serving size specified and the definitions in Chapter 4 (see sidebar: Nutrient Claims, page 92). For example, asparagus is consid- ered a good source of vitamin C, because it provides about 18 percent of the Daily Value for vitamin C. A food that is high in a particular nutrient provides 20 percent or more of the Daily Value for that nutrient per serving.

The leaves from most varieties are edible and are delicious when cooked. The tiny grain is very nutritious. (See Grains, page 272, for a discussion of the grain.) Amaranths are hot weather plants that thrive best in well-fertilized, well-irrigated raised beds in sunny areas. Amaranth greens are harvested 4 to 6 weeks after the planting season. They are transported to the market packed in ice and are sold in bunches. Once considered a weed in the United States, amaranth is now consumed as a vegetable green. Uses Young amaranth leaves are preferred for cooking. The leaves wilt easily and have a very short shelf life. They must be refrigerated or kept in ice water to retain their freshness and crispness. Amaranth leaves can be boiled, steamed, or stir-fried as a side dish to accompany meats, fish, or other vegetables. As a grain, amaranth is mostly ground into flour and used to make breads, pasta, pastries, and cereals. The flour is also available commercially. Varieties The genus Amaranthus includes a number of amaranth species. The common types include tampala, hon-moi-toi, bush greens, pigweed, Chinese spinach, and wild amaranth, some of which are edible and some not. Amaranth gangeticus, one of the edible varieties, is available in the United States as the green-leafed tampala. The red-leafed amaranth, known as Amaranth tricolor L., is also available, as is another familiar type called Joseph’s Coat. Origin & Botanical Facts Reports of the existence of amaranth date back to the 2nd century A.D. The grain was a staple of the Aztec diet and was used in religious ceremonies until its cultivation was outlawed by the Spanish conquerors. Amaranth was brought to Asia after the 15th century and was cultivated in China and India. Today, China and Central America are the world’s leading suppliers",

The size of an artichoke bud is determined by the stalk on which it grows and is not indicative of quality. Thick stalks, which are usually concentrated around the center of the plant, produce large artichokes, and the thinner side stalks produce smaller artichokes. Uses Artichokes picked in the fall or winter months may have bronze-tipped leaves or a slightly gray tint, which is a sign of exposure to frost. However, this should not affect the flavor of the artichoke. Squeezing the artichoke slightly should elicit a squeak if the leaves are still plump and crisp. Although the artichoke looks tough and hardy, it should be kept in the refrigerator for no more than 4 or 5 days",

Today, most of the European supply of artichokes is still grown by the countries surround- ing the Mediterranean Sea. Artichokes were introduced to the United States in the 19th century by European immi- grants and soon found their way to the midcoast region of California, where most of the domestic crop is cultivated today.

Origin & Botanical facts Arugula belongs to the Cruciferae family and is a close relative of the mustard. Ancient Egyptians and Romans considered arugula leaves in salads to be an aphrodisiac. It is a minor crop in the southeastern United States, grown to a limited extent commer- cially and in home vegetable gardens. Seeds often are listed in seed catalogs as \"roquette\" under the category of herbs. A cool season vegetable best grown in Florida during the fall, winter, and spring, it matures from seed in 2 to 3 months. Periods of very warm temperatures cause it to bolt (go to seed) rather quickly. Few pests attack the arugula. Uses The freshest, crispest leaves free of brown spots should be chosen. Arugula should be used as soon as possible after purchasing. If necessary, after removing any wilted leaves, the remaining unwashed leaves can be refrigerated for no more than 2 days in a plastic bag. The zesty leaves can be used raw in salads by themselves or tossed with other greens. Arugula also can be added to soups or lightly cooked and served as a side dish. The arugula is widely consumed in the Middle East as a garnish on meats and sandwiches. Tiny arugula blossoms also can be added to salads. Nutrient composition Arugula provides some vitamin A.

The green variety is the only one grown on a commercial scale in the United States, whereas the white is preferred in Europe. White asparagus is produced by banking soil against the plant to keep out sunlight, which otherwise would turn the stalks green. Also available, although not common, is a violet variety, with pinkish purple shoots and tips. Origin & botanical facts Asparagus was first cultivated in Greece about 2,500 years ago. In fact, the name asparagus is Greek for “stalk” or “shoot.” The ancient Greeks believed that asparagus had medicinal qualities and could cure toothaches and bee stings. The cultiva- tion of asparagus was adopted by the Romans, who carried it throughout Europe and Great Britain. From there, its popularity spread to the rest of the world. Traditionally, asparagus was a Northern Hemisphere crop, but today it is cultivated worldwide. The United States is the world’s largest supplier of asparagus, with most cultivation con- centrated in California. The asparagus plant is a perennial but requires three seasons to mature. In its first season, a crown forms with 6 inches of root. In its second season, the crown develops into a fern. Asparagus can be harvested in its third season, but the plant does not reach its prime until 6 to 8 years of age. At peak age, an asparagus field can yield up to 2 tons per acre.

Fresh bamboo shoots are light yellow or brown, purple at the root end, and white at the stalk end. The cooked young shoots are crisp, fragrant, and mild in flavor. Varieties The dozens of varieties of bamboo can be classified in several ways. All bamboo can be divided into those that grow uncon- trollably (the invasive type) and those that tend to clump. Bamboo also can be divided into those that are cold-hardy and those that are tropical and sub-tropical. Finally, within each of the above categories, the numerous species can be classified by their mature size (giant, large, medium, and dwarf).

Although bamboo shoots have been an important vegetable in Asian diets for thousands of years, Asian-grown bamboo is mostly consumed locally, with only small quantities processed for export. Bamboo is still a rare vegetable in Western countries, used exclusively in Oriental dishes. However, Europe and the United States are beginning to develop bamboo crops. Bamboo grows by sending out new rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) from which new shoots emerge. The con- stant appearance of new shoots and leaves gives the plant its evergreen appearance. The nutrients made by the leaves are stored in the rhizomes and then converted into the following year’s new growth. Because large crops occur in alternate years, growers maintain plants of various ages. To keep the shoots white, soil is sometimes piled against new growth areas to prevent them from developing chlorophyll. Nations that export bamboo shoots may harvest cultivated plantations or native forests. Unfortunately, lack of regulation has allowed excessive harvesting, which has led to a decline in some native forests. In contrast, because many hardy bamboo species spread uncontrollably, U.S. home gardeners who want to grow bamboo should construct an underground barrier wall to prevent its spread.

The vegetable’s name is derived from its distinctive bitter taste, the result of a high quinine content. The bitterness increases as the melon matures; young, green melons have a delicate, sour flavor, whereas older (yellow) ones are very bitter and acrid. When fully mature, the melon’s rind dries and splits lengthwise into three sections, revealing the bright-red arils that enclose the seeds. Bitter melons are normally eaten as immature fruits, but some people prefer the bitter-tasting, more mature fruits. Varieties The bitter melon is a variety of squash. A closely related variety, the balsam apple (Momordica balsamita), bears fruits similar to bitter melons except that they are egg- shaped and smaller, with smoother skin. Balsam apples, which have a taste similar to that of the bitter melon, are also cul- tivated, harvested, and prepared like the bitter melon. Origin & botanical facts Bitter melons originated in tropical India and have been cultivated for centuries throughout Asia. The bitter melon is an annual that grows in tropical and subtropical areas. Reaching up to 30 feet in length, the plant grows as a vine with tendrils that attach to plants or other objects for sup- port",

In this country, bitter melons are often grown on trellises and fences as decora- tive plants. Uses Bitter melons are available fresh from April through September in Asian markets and also are sold canned or dried. They can be refrigerated in a plastic bag for up to a week. When buying bitter melons, choose green ones if a less bitter taste is desired or yellow ones for a stronger, more bitter flavor. Before it is cooked, the fruit should be cut lengthwise to remove the seeds and the surrounding white fibers. The skin can be either left intact or removed. Bitter melons are always cooked before eating. In India, bitter melons are combined with potatoes or lentils and seasoned with cumin and turmeric. In China, they are steamed or used as an ingredient in soup. They can be thinly sliced and stir-fried with eggs, meats, or other vegetables. Stuffed with meat, shrimp, wood ears, and thin rice noodles, bitter melons can be braised in a light broth to make a bitter- sweet soup. The young leaves of the plant can be boiled and stir-fried like greens or used fresh in salads. Nutrient composition Bitter melons are high in vitamin C. They also contain many phytochemicals, includ- ing elasterol, lutein, and lycopene. The leafy tips are a good source of vitamin A. Vegetables 219 The broccoli plant is a dark-green vegetable with a firm stalk and branching arms that end in florets. The name comes from the Latin word brachium, meaning “arm” or “branch,” or the Italian word broccolo, for “cabbage sprout.” The edible portions are the florets and 6 to 8 inches of the supporting stem. Broccoli is closely related to cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts. Varieties The most common type of broccoli in the United States today is the sprouting, or Italian, green broccoli. The light-green stalks are topped by umbrella-shaped clus- ters of dark-green florets",

This variety is also called the Calabrese, named after the Italian province in which it was first grown. Broccoli rabe, a distinct but related type, has smaller florets and a stronger flavor. Origin & botanical facts Broccoli dates back to the time of the Roman Empire, when it was cultivated from wild cabbage native to coastal Europe. It was brought to the United States in the early 1900s by Italian immigrants to northern California. Currently, 90 percent of the domestic commercial market is supplied by California producers. Although it is not a popular vegetable worldwide, broccoli began gaining pop- ularity in the 1970s, when consumption per person increased from about a half pound per year to the current 4 1/2 pounds. Today, broccoli ranks 11th among leading U.S. vegetable crops. The broccoli plant is an upright annual, able to reach a height of 3 feet, with large spreading leaves. Usually grown from seed, broccoli is harvested 80 to 120 days after planting. The con- sumed portion of broccoli is actually a group of buds that are almost ready to flower. Overmature broccoli is tough and woody because the plant sugar is con- verted to lignin, a type of fiber that is not softened by cooking. Uses Broccoli with the tiniest buds and the darkest blue-green color should be selected. Avoid those with a yellowish cast. Broccoli should be stored unwashed in an open bag in the refrigerator, because excess moisture encourages the growth of mold. Before use, broccoli should be rinsed thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt. Broccoli can be con- sumed raw as an appetizer with dip or in salads, or it can be cooked in a variety of ways. Well-cooked broccoli should be tender enough to yield to a fork, yet remain crisp and bright. Because the florets tend Broccoli to cook faster than the stalks, stalks should be split to expose more surface area, which ensures even cooking",

Brussels sprouts are grown from seed, and the first sprouts are ready to pick about 4 months after the seeds are sown. The plant continues to produce sprouts for approximately 6 weeks. Brussels sprouts are very resistant to cold, and the tastiest sprouts are often those that mature after the first fall frost. They are usually available throughout the year. The peak season is from late August through March. California is the major supplier of Brussels sprouts in the United States.

Today's orange carrots descend from Dutch-bred carrots and have been grown in the United States since colonial times. Domestically, California produces about 60 percent of the United States crop, 25 percent of which goes into the production of mini-peeled carrots. Uses Carrots should be firm and brightly col- ored from top to bottom. Near the leafy crown of the root, there may be a green- ish tinge, but dark or black coloring is an indication of age. Keeping carrots refrig- erated in moisture-retaining packaging will preserve them for up to a month.

West Indians cook bitter cassava with brown sugar and spices to make a condiment called cassareep, available in Caribbean markets. In addition to its varied uses in the human diet, cassava is used as animal feed and in many indus- trial applications. Nutrient Composition Cassava is composed mostly of carbohy- drate and is a major source of calories in Third-World countries. The cassava is a root 2 to 3 inches in diameter and 6 to 12 inches long, covered with a coarse, inedible brown skin. To help preserve the root, the skin is often coated with a shiny film of wax. The flesh of the tuber is white with thin veins running through it and is potato-like in texture. Family Euphorbiaceae Scientific names Manihot esculenta Crantz (Manihot ultissima Phol [sweet]; Manihot aipi Phol [bitter]) Common name yuca, tapioca, manioc, apple temperatures fall below 50° Fahrenheit). Most cassava roots are harvested by hand, although Brazil has developed mechanical harvesters. Because the roots are extremely sensitive to physical damage, harvesting must be done carefully. To increase the short shelf life of the cassava further, the leaves are removed 2 weeks before harvest. In addition to dipping the roots into wax, storing the newly harvested roots in plastic bags extends the shelf life by 3 to 4 weeks",

In Africa, the roots are fermented in water, after which they are made into an alcoholic beverage; sun- dried for storage; or grated, formed into a dough, and cooked alone or in soups Varieties Until recently, the many varieties of cassava were divided into two main categories: bitter and sweet. Because the bitter root contains substances that are converted to toxic cyanide compounds when the root is cut, it must not be eaten raw; cooking destroys these substances. Although sweet cassava is believed to have low amounts of these potential toxins, taste is not a reliable predictor of toxin content, and experts recommend that all cassava be cooked.

Celeriac is propagated from seed, usually sown in pots or greenhouses in early spring, and then transplanted to the field in May. It requires a fertile soil that is rich in organic matter. For a large corm (underground stem base) to develop, a long growing season and plenty of water are required. Thus, celeriac thrives in moist, temperate climates.

A bunch of celery is actually a single stalk consisting of separate ribs, and the most tender, inner ribs are called the hearts. The crispness of celery comes from the rigidity of its cell walls and its high water content. In fact, celery is mostly water, which makes it low in calories and an ideal snack food. Varieties Although celery is available in many colors, most of the celery grown in the United States belongs to the green varieties, which range in shade from pale to dark and are referred to as Pascal. One common green variety is the American Green, also known as the Tall Utah or Greensnap, which does not require blanching (the banking of soil against the plant to keep it from turning dark green upon exposure to sunlight). Other varieties of celery include the Giant Pink, with pink or red stems and dark- green leaves; the Golden Self-Blanching, with pale, golden-yellow leaves and golden stems; and the Ivory Tower, a fast-matur- ing, self-blanching variety with pale leaves. Origin & botanical facts Wild celery is a biennial or annual herb native to southern Europe, Asia, and Africa, growing in marshes along the muddy banks of tidal rivers or in other saltwater areas. Although it resembles domestic celery, it is smaller, with a stronger, more pungent odor and flavor. Before the familiar milder, thick-stalked forms were cultivated, celery probably was used solely as a seasoning and medicinal herb",

    "content": "Leafy cultivated varieties may date back 2,000 years or more, but stalk celery seems to have been grown first in Italy in the 16th century. In the 1690s, John Evelyn, an English diarist, described celery as a new vegetable. Today, celery is grown in Great Britain, India, the United States, and Canada. Celery requires a moist, rich soil for good growth. It is especially successful in low-lying, alkaline areas such as the eastern regions of Florida and Great Britain. Because of its high water content, celery requires large amounts of mois- ture; otherwise, the stalks become stringy and tough. Celery is propagated from seeds so tiny that it takes more than a mil- lion of them to add up to a pound. Most commercially grown celery is planted in March or April, in greenhouses or seedbeds with controlled watering. About 2 months after sowing, when the seedlings are 4 to 6 inches tall, they are transplanted to fields. Varieties that require blanching usually are planted in trenches to facilitate the banking of the soil against the plants. Three to 4 months after field planting, celery is ready for harvesting. Uses Celery that is light in color and shiny has the best flavor. Celery should be stored by the bunch in perforated plastic veg- etable bags in the refrigerator crisper. Celery is a versatile vegetable. Raw celery adds crunch to chicken, seafood, egg, potato, and green salads. It is an excellent snack food or appetizer. Celery also can be microwaved, stir-fried, braised, or steamed to serve as a main vegetable, but it usually is combined with other veg- etables or is included in stuffings for poultry and fish. Celery even has been made into a uniquely flavored soft drink, Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray tonic. Nutrient composition Celery is a good source of vitamin C.

SERVING SIZE: 1/2 cup pieces, cooked (80 g) The chayote, a tropical member of the cucumber and squash family, is actually a fruit. It resembles a summer squash or avocado in shape and appearance but has deep, lengthwise ridges and a single, flat, nut-like seed. The fruit can be variable in size, color, texture, and flavor. The skin of the fruit can be smooth, deeply fissured, or even wrinkled and prickly. Colors range from light-green to almost white. The opaque flesh has a cucumber-like texture and varies in color. Once heated, the flesh becomes somewhat translucent. Except for the seed, the entire fruit is edible.

However, the fruit is identified by a variety of names. In many places, it is recognized as mango squash, chocho, christophine, and choke. In Louisiana, it is called mirliton, and in Florida it is called a vegetable pear. Origin & botanical facts Chayote is native to Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. The fruit is believed to have been cultivated by the Aztecs and Mayans long before Columbus arrived. The name chayote is derived from the Mayan word “chayotli.” The plant is now grown in South America, North Africa, and in subtropical parts of southern Florida",

Ideal growing conditions include full sunlight, high moisture levels, and rich, well-drained soil. Under the proper conditions, some plants can produce up to 100 fruits in a single season. The fruits must be harvested young or they will become tough. Chayote is available year-round, but the peak season is late summer through early fall. Uses A firm, unblemished, clear-green chayote is the best choice. The chayote keeps up to 1 month stored uncovered in a cool, dry, dark place, or it can be stored in a perforated plastic bag in a refrigerator vegetable crisper for up to a week. The chayote is most easily prepared by peeling the fruit and microwaving or steaming it for a few minutes. Although very young fruit can be prepared with the skin left on, more mature fruit should be peeled under running water to prevent being irritated by the sticky sap under the skin. Cooked chayote can be seasoned to taste and eaten as is; sliced or diced and added to other dishes such as salads in place of cucumbers; or prepared like french fries. Chayote halves that are stuffed and baked make a filling main dish. The chayote can be substituted for many other fruits and vegetables in recipes. A fully mature fruit may be used in place of pota- toes in soups and purées. The grated fruit also is useful as a substitute for carrots and zucchini in breads and pastries. Cooked, mashed, and seasoned with sweet spices, it resembles applesauce and can be served as a light snack or dessert.

The forcing chicories are initially sown outdoors, but because exposure to light tends to create a bitter taste, the plants are transferred to a dark area (a process called blanching) for the latter half of their growth. As a result, forcing chicories have a milder fla- vor. The most common forcing varieties are the Witloof chicory, sometimes called Belgian endive, and the red-leaf radic- chio, an Italian chicory that is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. Nonforcing chicories do not require blanching. These varieties are grown like lettuce, without forcing. The Italian radichetta, more common in North America than in Europe, has narrow leaves that grow on wide stalks and are cooked like asparagus.

    "content": "Later, it was brought to North America, where it now grows wild and in cultivated form. Chicory can be grown in a variety of soil types. Seeds generally are sown directly into open ground. Because most types of chicory thrive in cool temperatures, planting is done in early spring or late fall. Chicory plants have shallow roots, so frequent irrigation is necessary. The plants grow with a scruffy appearance and with multiple stick-like stems that are 2 to 3 feet tall. Bright, almost iridescent, blue flowers appear on the stems in the second year. Forcing varieties are dug up in late fall, the leaves and roots are cut back, and the plants are laid horizontally in pots of moist peat in a dark, warm place. After 3 or 4 weeks, the heads are ready to be cut. Nonforcing varieties of chicory are plant- ed in the spring and picked like lettuce in the fall. They can be used immediately or stored in a cool place for later use. Leading domestic producers of chicory, particularly the newly popular radicchio, are California and New Jersey. Some chicory is also grown in Mexico and Italy. Uses Chicory, Belgian endive, and radicchio should be selected and stored in a manner similar to arugula and lettuce. Chicory leaves most often are used raw in salads. The roots of some varieties of chicory are roasted and ground to make a coffee sub- stitute or flavoring popular in Louisiana. Nutrient composition Chicory is high in folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. It is also a good source of calcium, magnesium, riboflavin, and vitamin B6. Chicory is a perennial that forms long, stick-like stems and ragged, widely spaced bunches of leaves, sometimes in tight heads or in loose formations. The outer leaves may be green, white, or red, depending on variety, and have a strong, slightly bitter taste. The inner leaves are usually paler in color and milder in flavor",

Vegetables 231 Because corn is a member of the grass family, it is not strictly a vegetable but a grain (see Grains, page 269). However, one type, sweet corn, is prepared and served as a fresh vegetable. The seeds, or kernels, which are the edible part of the plant, form in spikelets on a woody axis called an ear. They are covered with a green husk. Ears of corn vary in size, and the kernels range from white to yellow, orange, red, brown, blue, purple, and black, although sweet corn is always white or butter-yellow. Variety Of the many types of corn, sweet corn is the only variety that is eaten fresh as a vegetable. Sweet corn is available in several varieties divided by kernel color. Some sweet corn is pure yellow; some, like Silver Queen, is white; and some, like Butter and Sugar, is bicolored, that is, it has both yellow and white kernels.

    "content": "Popping corn, baby corn, and the white corn known as hominy are different types of eating corn. Origin & botanical facts Corn is native to the Americas, probably having originated in Mexico or Guatemala, where historians believe it evolved from a wild grain called teosinte that still grows in the Mexican highlands. The corn plant, which can attain heights of 20 feet, has a hard, jointed stalk. Male flowers develop in the tassel at the top of the stalk, and the female flower is a cluster at the joint of the stalk. Corn is polli- nated by the wind. The corn silk hang- ing from the husk of each ear is the pollen receptor; each thread must receive a grain of pollen for the kernels to develop. Corn grows best during long, hot summers. It requires rich soil and regular fertilizing, particularly with nitrogen. Because the flowers are wind-pollinated, plants should be spaced closely together. The ears do not ripen well in cold weather, so the seeds must be planted in plenty of time for the kernels to develop before the first autumn frost. Although each ear of corn produces many kernels, the plant has no natural mechanism for dispersing its seeds. To ensure that it will be tender and succulent for eating, sweet corn is picked before it reaches maturity. Uses Sweet corn is a popular vegetable in the United States. The average American eats about 25 pounds of corn every year, most of it frozen or canned, but in summer, corn is preferred fresh on the cob. Because the sugars in the kernels of sweet corn begin to convert to starch as soon as the ear is picked, corn should be eaten as soon after harvest as possible. While still on the cob and after the husks are removed, corn can be boiled, steamed, or microwaved, but the secret to retaining the flavor is to cook it no more than a few minutes. For grilling ears of corn in their husks, the ears should be soaked in water for about 20 minutes and then cooked on a grill rack or in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes",

Today, watercress is grown in Great Britain and in the United States, mainly in California, Florida, and Virginia. Winter cress is cultivated as a substitute for watercress when flowing water is not available for planting. It is produced mostly in the United States, favored by growers because of its hardiness. Cress is propagated from seeds or stem cuttings and generally prefers the cool growing conditions of early spring and late fall. The growth of watercress requires a special environment with flooded soil beds containing absolutely pure water, because any water-borne con- taminants could be deposited on the plant. The leafy stems are generally harvested about 180 days after planting. Requirements for other varieties vary. Garden cress, which can grow up to 18 inches tall, prefers sun or light shade and well-drained soil. Seeds can be sown at intervals from early spring through the summer in order to furnish a constant supply of young leaves. The whole plants are harvested about 60 days after planting. Hardy winter cress is not planted until July or August and can be harvested from late fall through the winter, until the plants begin to flower in spring. The leaves of most cresses are picked when they are 3 to 5 inches long, or the entire plant can be harvested before seed stalks form. SERVING SIZE: 1 cup, raw (34 g) Cress (watercress) Uses The raw, young leaves of the cress plant are sold in bunches. When selecting watercress, choose crisp leaves with deep color, and avoid those with yellow leaves. Watercress can be refrigerated up to 5 days in a plastic bag or with the stem ends in a glass of water and the leaves covered with a plastic bag. The leaves and trimmed stems may be added to salads, sandwiches, and soups and used as a garnish for a variety of dishes. Nutrient composition Watercress is high in vitamin A and vitamin C",

Its interior is generally pale green to white, with rows of tender, edible seeds down the center. Cucumbers are largely water. They are moist but crisp, and their flavor is sweet and mild. Varieties Cucumbers grow in a variety of shapes and sizes, from tiny gherkins to green- house types that are up to 20 inches long. All have a similar flavor. Those grown primarily for eating fresh are called slic- ing varieties and include both field-grown and greenhouse cucumbers. The green- house varieties, sometimes called English cucumbers, tend to be longer and nar- rower, milder, and seedless. One type of English cucumber is sometimes referred to as “burpless.” Other varieties are cul- tivated for pickling. These are usually smaller than slicing cucumbers and have bumpy, lighter-colored skins. The smallest is the gherkin, which is only 1 or 2 inches long",

Today, the leading producers of cucum- bers in the United States are Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina. Cucumbers require warm tempera- tures and should not be planted until all danger of frost has passed. Distinct male and female flowers develop on one cucumber plant, and pollen is carried by insects; 10 to 20 bee visits per flower per day are required to produce long, straight fruit. In contrast, greenhouse cucumbers are not pollinated, so they form without seeds. Both field and greenhouse types are picked as soon as they are of edible size so that the plants will continue to produce flowers and fruit. should be left intact until just before cooking",

Because a carbon steel blade will blacken the flesh, a stainless steel knife is preferred for cutting eggplant. Eggplant can be stuffed and baked, broiled, roasted, fried, stir-fried, or stewed. Because they are very porous, eggplants soak up oil easily during frying. Oil absorption can be minimized by salting to draw out the moisture and compact the flesh.

Origin & Botanical Facts First cultivated more than 4,000 years ago, the eggplant is believed to be native to India, from where it was subsequent- ly brought to China. In the Middle Ages, Arab traders brought it to Spain and northern Africa. By the 18th century, both the French and the Italians culti- vated eggplant, which they called aubergine. Thomas Jefferson introduced the eggplant to the United States. However, it was not until the 20th century that Americans began to use the eggplant as a food. Previously, it was used as a table decoration. Today, the eggplant is most popular in the cuisines of southern Italy and the Middle East. The eggplant is a frost-intolerant perennial grown as an annual. It will sus- tain damage if the temperature falls below 65° Fahrenheit. Eggplant is available throughout the year. The peak season is from July to October. Florida and North Carolina produce half the domestic crop. In the winter months, California and Mexico are also major suppliers.

The clear yellow flowers of fennel produce seed structures that resemble umbrellas. Both the root and the leaves have a mild licorice flavor. The seeds have a pungent, aromatic scent. Variety The two basic types of fennel, common fennel and Florence fennel, bear a close resemblance to one another but are used differently. The shoots, leaves, and seeds (called “fruit”) of the common fennel are used primarily as flavoring agents for food. Several varieties of common fennel have seeds that differ in length, width, and taste. These include the sweet variety, also known as French or Roman fennel, characterized by long, yellowish green fruit with a sweet flavor; Indian fennel, which is brownish, smaller, and less rounded; and the pale-green Persian and Japanese varieties, which are the smallest and have a stronger anise flavor and odor. Florence fennel, also called finocchio, is somewhat smaller than common fennel and is grown mainly for its broad, bulbous leaf base, which is eaten as a vegetable. Origin & botanical facts Fennel is native to the Mediterranean region and was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The Romans enjoyed the young shoots as both a flavoring and, according to their belief, an aid to controlling obesity. The Greeks called it “marathon,” a name derived from “maraino,” meaning “to grow thin.” From the Mediterranean, fennel was carried east to India and also north to Europe and England, especially to Roman colonies. Spanish settlers are believed to have brought fennel to the Western Hemisphere more than 200 years ago. In 1824, the American consul at Liverpool gave Thomas Jefferson fennel seeds for his garden at Monticello. Fennel is a long-lived plant that thrives almost anywhere. Fennel plants usually grow to 3 or 4 feet but have been known to reach 7 feet. Young plants form a bulbous, thick root the first year and flower the following summer",

According to the Pen Tsao Ching (Classics of Herbs), written by Shen Nung around 3000 B.C., ginger “eliminates body odor and puts a person in touch with the spiritual realm.” In ancient India, ginger was believed to cleanse the body spiritually. Ginger also was used to preserve food and treat diges- tive problems. As in India, the ancient Greeks used ginger for digestive problems by eating ginger wrapped in bread after large meals. Eventually, ginger was added to the bread dough, and the product became known as gingerbread. The Romans also used ginger as a digestive aid. Arab traders introduced ginger to the Mediterranean area, and in the 16th century, Francisco de Mendoza of Spain brought it to the West Indies. In England and Colonial America, ginger was made into ginger beer, a popu- lar home remedy for diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting and a precursor to today’s ginger ale. Ginger thrives in the tropics and in warmer regions of the temperate zone. Currently, the herb is grown in several regions of West Africa and the West Indies, and in India and China. The plant reaches maturity in the late summer when the foliage begins to turn yellow. However, the root can be harvested at any stage simply by digging it up. The finest quality ginger comes from Jamaica, where production is most abundant. In the United States, ginger is grown in Florida, Hawaii, and along the east coast of Texas.

Only the long, fleshy roots of this vegetable are used, because the leaves contain a slightly poisonous compound and have no culinary value. Rough and cream-colored, the parsnip-like root can grow to 20 inches in length and 1 to 3 inches in diameter. A sulfur-containing compound known as allyl isothiocyanate is responsible for the root’s strong, pungent odor and hot, biting flavor, which is reminiscent of mustard and results from a chemical reaction that occurs only when the root is bruised or cut. Origin & botanical facts The horseradish is native to Eastern Europe and has been used as an herb since ancient times. It was grown in Greece more than 3,000 years ago. Mentioned in the Bible, it is one of the bitter herbs served during the Jewish Passover festival. In medieval Europe, the root was believed to be a cure-all. Initially used only for its medicinal properties, by the 1600s horse- radish had become a common condiment for fish and meat in Europe. The word “horse” in horseradish, often used to imply coarseness, as in horse-mint or horse chestnut, is used similarly in this case to distinguish the plant from the edible radish (Raphanus sativus). The perennial horseradish plant grows worldwide and is often found growing wild along roadsides throughout Europe and North America.

Jicama can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. If it is stored for longer periods, its starch content converts to sugar. Ideally the tuber should be stored in a cool, dry place, because too much moisture can cause mold to form. The peeled tuber can be eaten raw or cooked. The sliced or julienned root retains its crispness even after sautéing or stir-frying and can be added to soups or stews. Raw jicama can be served as part of a vegetable platter or added to salads. It serves as a substitute for water chestnut. Nutrient composition The jicama is high in vitamin C and is a good source of fiber",

Like other seaweed, it is a large form of algae. Fresh seaweed and other sea vegetables are similar in texture to some dry-land greens, but they have a strong, salty, seawater flavor. Varieties The thousands of varieties of algae grow in a broad spectrum of colors, shapes, and sizes, ranging from the small freshwater algae to the long-stemmed kelp that flour- ishes in the oceans. Also called seaweed, agar-agar, carrageenan, and dulse, algae are generally classified by their color, which varies from brown to red, green, or blue-green. Kelp is one of the brown algae. Some of the varieties of kelp available in Japan include Wakame, Arame, Kombu, and Hijiki. Origin & botanical facts The word “seaweed” generally refers to the large red or brown varieties of algae. Brown algae grow in cold waters, and red algae thrive in tropical seas. Algae com- pose two-thirds of the plant material on earth and are among the very few plants that have not changed for centuries. In ancient times, sailors harvested the kelp beds that thrived off the coasts of England and France and burned the plants for fuel",

However, 18th-century European physicians noted that enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) rarely developed in people who lived along the coast. In 18th-century England, a physician success- fully used charred kelp to treat a patient who had goiter. It was not until the 19th century, however, that scientists discovered that goiter is caused by iodine deficiency and that kelp is rich in iodine. For several decades after this discovery, Europeans and Americans harvested kelp from under- sea rocks to use as a source of iodine. Uses Today, seaweed is a staple in the diets of some people. In Japan, seaweed consti- tutes approximately 25 percent of the diet. Kombu and Wakame, two popular types of kelp, are used extensively. Kombu is used to make a tasty broth, and Wakame is used as an ingredient in soups and stir-fries. Sheets of Wakame are used to prepare sushi. Powdered kelp can serve as a salt substitute, helping to flavor soups, salads, and tomato juice. In the United States, dried sheets of seaweed can be found in Asian groceries and in some supermarkets.

Origin & botanical facts The kohlrabi, which literally means “cabbage turnip,” is descended from both the wild cabbage and the wild turnip. Although the origin of this vegetable is uncertain, a vegetable answering to the same description was mentioned by the Roman botanist Pliny in the 1st century A.D. No such vegetable was again described until after the Middle Ages. Today, the kohlrabi is mainly eaten in central and eastern Europe. Unlike other cruciferous vegetables, the part of kohlrabi that is eaten is a swollen part of the stem. Kohlrabi has so declined in popularity in the last century that it can be difficult to purchase. The reason for this decline is not known but may be its increased toughness with larger sizes. Kohlrabi leaves are similar to collard greens or kale in flavor. The succulent, tender leaves of young kohlrabi plants can be cooked like spinach or mustard greens. Nutrient composition Kohlrabi is high in vitamin C. Raw kohlrabi is a good source of fiber. Both raw and cooked forms also contain antioxidants and bioflavonoids.

Uses Kohlrabi bulbs that are plum-size or smaller, firm, and unblemished and have leaves that are still attached are best. After the leaf stems are removed, the bulbs of kohlrabi can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks (longer if placed in sealed plastic bags). The kohlrabi bulb may be eaten raw or cooked. Although small, tender bulbs generally do not require peel- ing, the skin of medium and large ones should be removed before use. The crisp flesh can be served raw in salads or made into a relish. The bulb also can be cubed, sliced, or julienned and steamed until tender. The practice in many central European countries is to hollow out the vegetable and stuff it with meat or other vegetables before baking or steaming. Vegetables 243 The leek is related to garlic, scallions, and onions and resembles a large scallion. Unlike the onion, however, it does not form a real bulb but grows as a thick, fleshy stalk with flattened leaves. The leaves are green to blue-green or purple and wrap tightly around each other like rolled paper. The white leaf base—the part that is most commonly eaten—has a flavor and fragrance similar to but milder than onions. Varieties The many varieties of leeks differ mostly in the color of their leaves, their general cold hardiness, and the degree of bulbing at the stem base. Those with blue or purple leaves tend to be the hardiest. An old French variety called Bleu Solaise, which is known to be resistant to cold, has blue-green leaves. Origin & botanical facts Leeks are native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, where they still grow wild. Both wild and cultivated leeks have been consumed for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, Emperor Nero consumed large quantities of leeks in the belief that they would improve his singing voice",

Today, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands lead the world in leek production. Although not as popular in the United States, the leek is cultivated in California, Michigan, New Jersey, and Virginia. Leeks can be grown from seed or transplants, but transplanting is the preferred method, for which plants are begun in containers between December and April. Leeks prefer a cool to moderate climate, rich but well-drained soil, and uniform watering. The base is blanched by tilling the soil up around each plant when it is about the size of a pencil. Blanching makes the edible portion longer and whiter. Leek plants produce flowering stems more than 6 feet in height, with white, pink, or dark-red flowers. On most leek varieties, numer- ous bulbils, or secondary bulbs, form around the base of the plant, and these can be used to start new plants. Uses Before being used, leeks should be washed thoroughly to remove any soil or grit trapped between the leaves, and the rootlets and leaf ends should be trimmed off. Like onions and garlic, leeks are used primarily to add flavor to a variety of Leek dishes. Raw leeks can be sliced thin and added to salads of all types. Sliced or puréed, they add zest to quiches, stews, casseroles, mixed vegetable dishes, and soups. They are one of the key ingredi- ents in French vichyssoise, a classic cold potato and leek soup. They also may be baked, braised in broth or wine, broiled, sautéed, or microwaved. Leeks should be cooked only until barely tender.

The leaves are pale to dark green or green with red edges, crisp, and mild to pungent. Varieties Four basic types of lettuce are grown: head lettuce, loose leaf, butterhead, and romaine. The most common, popular variety is iceberg, a compact head lettuce that is pale green and has a delicate flavor. Loose leaf lettuce forms rosettes of crisp, curly leaves 8 to 12 inches long and includes the red-edged varieties. The mild butterhead lettuce, including the Boston and Bibb varieties, has a softly compressed head, 8 to 12 inches across, of grass-green leaves that fade to a lighter yellowish green in the interior. Romaine lettuce forms a dark-green, tightly compressed head of leaves about 10 inches long and has a stronger, more pungent flavor than the other varieties.

In the United States, lettuce ranks a close second to potatoes as the most popular fresh vegetable. The four leading American producers are California, Arizona, Florida, and Colorado. Lettuce is cultivated by direct seed- ing into fields or by seedling transplan- tation into raised beds. Loose leaf lettuce matures about 6 weeks after seeds are sown; other types take longer to mature. Romaine takes the longest (up to 12 weeks). Head lettuce is harvested when the heads reach about 2 pounds. Because lettuce is very perishable, harvesting is done by hand, and the crop is packed directly into boxes in the field. Head lettuce, which is the hardiest, can be shipped long distances without damage, but leaf lettuce is more fragile and usually is grown for local and regional markets. Uses Lettuce should be used as soon after pur- chase as possible, but if it must be stored, leaves that are wilting should be removed. Unwashed lettuce can be kept 3 to 4 days at most in a perforated plastic bag in the vegetable crisper of the refrigerator. Lettuce is most often eaten raw in salads and sandwiches. Iceberg, leaf, or romaine Lettuce works well in Greek salad; romaine is often used for Caesar salad. Combinations of lettuce varieties make for tastier and more nutritious salads. A salad spinner improves the quality of salads by drying the greens quickly and completely. In addition to being used in salads, lettuce leaves can be used to hold cooked vegetables, sandwich fillings, and condiments. Nutrient composition Romaine and loose leaf lettuce contain five to six times the vitamin C and five to ten times the vitamin A of iceberg. Romaine and butterhead lettuce are good sources of folate",

The secret to tender but crisp okra is to sauté the whole pods for no more than 5 min- utes. In the United States, okra is most popularly known as an ingredient in gumbo, a stew-like dish that is a specialty of New Orleans Creole cuisine. Okra is also available in frozen and canned forms. Nutrient composition Okra is high in vitamin C and is a good source of magnesium. Alabama, and California are the leading producers in the United States. The okra plant is a tropical perennial belonging to the cotton family. The plants begin to produce flowers about 60 days after germination and can grow 3 to 5 feet in height. The maroon-centered, pale-yellow flowers develop into slender seedpods that are harvested a few days after the flower petals have fallen. Okra, the vegetable, should not be confused with Chinese okra, which is also known as dishcloth gourd, sponge gourd, or loofah. Uses Because very young or fully developed okra pods tend to be flavorless and stringy, pods that are 1 to 3 inches should be selected. Fresh okra is very perishable and should be used as soon as possible. It can be stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Fresh okra should be washed and thoroughly dried before cooking, because moisture causes the pods to become slimy.

Scallions (also called green onions), the most common type of fresh onion, are pulled up before the bulb forms. Sweet onions, another type of fresh onion, grown in warmer climates, are harvested and sold during the spring and summer. They are char- acterized by a light-colored, thin skin and a high water and sugar content, which gives them a mild, sweet flavor. The most popular sweet onions are the mild Maui from Hawaii, the juicy Vidalia from Georgia, and the round, golden Walla- Walla from Washington State. Dry onions, also called storage onions, are grown in cooler northern states and are available year-round. They have a darker, thicker skin, a firmer texture, and a stronger, more pungent flavor. They range from white to yellow and red. Smaller varieties of dry onions include the marble-sized pearl onions and the slightly larger boiling onions. Although red onions tend to be sweeter than yellow or white onions, the flavor of dry onions is influenced more by variety and origin than by color. Origin & botanical facts Onions were grown by the ancient Egyptians, who regarded them as sacred. From Egypt, onions were brought to Rome, where they acquired their current name, derived from the Latin unio, mean- ing “large pearl.” Christopher Columbus brought the onion from Europe to the Americas. Today, onions are among the world’s leading vegetable crops. Onion plants are propagated from seeds or from seedlings and are planted on raised beds, in fertile, well-balanced soil. They are hardy plants, able to withstand temperatures as low as 20° Fahrenheit, and are generally planted in early spring, 4 to 6 weeks before the last spring freeze. When first planted, young onions concentrate their growth on new roots and green leaves or tops.

Varieties Although more than 30 varieties of parsley exist, the most commonly used in the United States are the curly-leaved and the Italian, or flat-leaved, varieties. Among the curled parsleys are Moss Curled, Green Velvet, and Paramount Imperial. The flat-leaved variety, most commonly used in southeastern Europe and in Asia, has a more vibrant flavor than the curled types. Origin & botanical facts Parsley is believed to have originated in southern Europe, around the Mediterranean, and has been cultivated since about 320 B.C. In ancient times, parsley wreaths were believed to ward off drunkenness. According to Greek mythology, parsley sprang from the blood of Opheltes, the infant son of King Lycurgus of Nemea, who was killed by a serpent while his nurse directed some thirsty soldiers to water. Thus, Greek soldiers associated parsley with death and avoided contact with it before battle. A completely dif- ferent meaning is imparted to the herb in the Jewish Seder, the ritual Passover meal. Because parsley is one of the first herbs to appear in the spring, it is used in the Seder to symbolize new beginnings. The ancient Romans ate parsley after meals to freshen their breath, and the Roman physician Galen prescribed it for epilepsy and as a diuretic. In Europe dur- ing the Middle Ages, parsley was regard- ed as the devil’s herb and was believed to bring disaster on anyone who grew it unless it was planted on Good Friday. Nevertheless, medieval abbess and herbalist Hildegard of Bingen and the 17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper prescribed it in various forms for heart and chest pain and for arthritis. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, parsley was prescribed for a variety of medical conditions. However, none of these uses is recognized in modern med- icine. Today, parsley is used primarily as a flavoring agent and a garnish. Parsley is a hardy plant that can be grown easily in almost any soil",

Fresh parsley can be wrapped in damp paper towels and stored in an open plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. The curly-leaved varieties of parsley are used as a flavoring, a salad ingredient, and a garnish. Flat-leaved parsley, with its stronger flavor, is frequently used as a seasoning in Italian cooking.

Modern varieties are bred to grow a fat, wedge-shaped root. The most disease- resistant types are the Gladiator, a sweet, early-maturing parsnip, the Avonresister, and the Andover, a new American variety. The most popular parsnip is the All American, which has broad “shoulders,” white flesh, and a tender core. Origin & botanical facts Wild parsnips were eaten by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The word pastinaca, part of the modern scientific name for parsnips, was used by Pliny in the 1st century A.D., but it may have referred to either parsnips or carrots, or both. According to Pliny, the parsnip was so val- ued by the Emperor Tiberius that he had it imported to Rome from the banks of the Rhine",

Today, parsnips are cultivated throughout Europe, Canada, and the northern United States. Northern California and Michigan are the leading domestic growers. Although it is a biennial, the parsnip is usually grown as an annual, harvested before the second year’s leaves begin to appear. Parsnips are propagated from seeds and planted in deep, loamy, fine soil that has not been fertilized recently. In cold climates, parsnips are planted in early spring, but in areas where temper- atures rarely fall below 25 degrees, seeds can be sown in early fall for a spring harvest. The roots take from 100 to 120 days to mature from seeds. The green stalks grow above ground, anywhere from 9 inches to 2 feet in height, with smooth, oblong leaflets about 4 or 5 inches long. The flowers, when permitted to develop, are deep yellow. Chilling the parsnip roots, either before or after harvesting, results in a sweeter flavor. Uses The best parsnips are those that are small to medium in size, crisp, and plump. They should be stored in a perforated plas- tic bag in the refrigerator crisper.

Each type includes numerous varieties. The most common variety of sweet peppers is the round bell pepper, which is sold by color. Although all bell peppers are green when immature, most turn red when completely ripe, and some turn yellow, orange, purple, or brown. Ripe, colored bell peppers are usually sweeter than their immature, green counterparts. Other varieties of sweet pepper include banana peppers, a mild variety that is the shape and color of bananas; Cubanelle, a tapered, light-green or yellow variety that is more flavorful than bell peppers; and pimientos, thick-fleshed, heart-shaped peppers that are ideal for roasting. Hot peppers, also called chilis, vary greatly in size, shape, and spiciness, and, like sweet peppers, they are green when immature",

Origin & botanical facts Peppers are native to Asia and the Western Hemisphere, where they have been a culinary staple for thousands of years, but they were unknown in Europe until Columbus brought them home from his first voyage to the Americas. In the United States, sweet peppers constitute more than 60 percent of the pepper crop. The leading domestic growers of peppers are California and Florida. Many pep- pers also are imported from Latin America and Asia. Both sweet and hot peppers are peren- nial shrubs that thrive in tropical areas but have been adapted as annuals in cold- er regions. Plants grow to about 2 feet tall and equally wide. Proper flowering and fruit development require humidi- ty.

The skin can be smooth or rough, and tan, white, red, or any of a variety of less common colors. The flesh is usually white but can be yellow to deep orange and has a smooth to mealy texture. In flavor, they range from bland to buttery sweet. Varieties Potatoes are categorized by flesh color, use, or age. The white potatoes include several varieties. The Russet has a thick, netted, brown skin and a somewhat dry, mealy texture. The Round White and the Long White have a more moist, waxy tex- ture and smooth, tan skins. The Round Red potato has a smooth, reddish skin and creamy white, firm flesh. Yellow, or sweet, potatoes such as the Yukon Gold (not to be confused with the sweet potato) have a thicker brown skin, golden flesh, and a sweet, buttery flavor. Specialty vari- eties, including blue and purple potatoes, are nutty in flavor and difficult to find in most markets.

Origin & botanical facts Radishes are an ancient vegetable, first cul- tivated thousands of years ago either in the eastern Mediterranean region or in the Far East and quickly spread throughout the world. The earliest radishes to be culti- vated were the black varieties. Long, taper- ing white radishes were first mentioned in 16th-century European literature, and about 200 years later, round radishes first appeared, along with the red-skinned types. In the United States today, California and Florida are the leading radish growers. From the top of the root, the leaves of the radish plant form a rosette that can grow to 1 foot in height. The radish is a cool- weather annual, one of the easiest vegeta- bles to grow. Propagation is by direct seeding into a sandy soil with consistent moisture. Spring radishes can be planted as soon as the ground is soft. The fastest-growing varieties mature in about 3 weeks. Winter radishes are planted in late summer so they can mature in the cool temperatures of autumn. These larger radishes take at least 55 days to reach a reasonable size.

The Magre has an attractive, round root shape, and the Merrick is one of the rare white-fleshed rutabaga varieties. Origin & botanical facts The rutabaga originated from a chance hybridization between cabbage and turnip plants. A relatively new vegetable com- pared with those that have been around for thousands of years, it probably emerged in medieval gardens where turnips and cabbage were grown side by side. The first mention of rutabagas occurred in European botanical literature of the 17th century. Rutabagas became very popular in Scandinavia (the Swedish word rotabagge means “round root”), from where they were brought to England in the late 18th century, acquiring the name “swede.” Their cultivation in North America began early in the 19th century",

Rutabagas are biennials that thrive in cool temperatures and are best produced as a fall crop. Because they require a long growing season, rutabagas should be planted in the early spring in light but rich soil with good drainage. Seeds are sown directly into fields, and the plants must be irrigated regularly to produce a sweet, tender crop. The roots are ready for consumption about 3 months after sowing, when they are 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Harvesting should occur when the ground is dry so that very little soil adheres to the roots. Because they are resistant to fall frost and light winter freezes, rutabagas can be mulched, left in the ground, and harvested throughout the fall and winter. If they are pulled immediately, they can be refrigerated or stored in cool, underground cellars. Rutabagas are available year-round. Uses Rutabagas that are smooth-skinned, firm, and heavy for their size should be chosen. They can be refrigerated in a plastic bag Rutabaga up to 2 weeks.

Salsify appeared in North America and in England during the 18th century. The salsify plant is also known as “vegetable oyster” or “oyster plant” because its mild, sweet flavor is reminis- cent of that of the oyster, although some prefer to call it the “goatsbeard plant” because its grass-like leaves are bunched in a manner resembling a “goatee.” The plant is a biennial, alternating yearly between purple and rose-colored flowers that resemble dandelions and are closely related to lettuce and chicory. The roots grow best in rich, slightly alkaline, fine-textured, loose sand and after expo- sure to the cold.

Nutrient composition Salsify is not a significant source of nutrients. Salsify is a white-fleshed vegetable root that could easily be mistaken for a yellow- ish gray carrot or parsnip. The salsify plant, which is 10 to 12 inches in length and has a diameter of about 2 1/2 inches, is cultivated primarily for its slender edible roots, although the young tender leaves, often called “chards,” are commonly used in salads",

Sweet Spanish is an example of a long-day variety (one that develops best in areas with more hours of daylight and in midsummer). Southport White Globe onions are grown as scallions in areas with short days, where the short- er day length prevents bulb formation. Crossing onions with a variety called the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistu- losum), an onion that resembles a scallion but is more bitter, results in hybrids that can be grown as scallions in the summer and in areas with long days. Origin & botanical facts Scallions are propagated from seeds planted in raised beds of fertile, well-pre- pared, well-balanced soil with good mois- ture retention. They are hardy plants, capable of withstanding temperatures as low as 20° Fahrenheit. However, minimal temperatures of 55° are necessary for the plants to emerge from the soil, and optimal growth occurs when the temperature ranges between 68° and 77° Fahrenheit. Growth of scallions also depends on day length. Scallions are planted in fall, spring, and summer and are ready for harvest 2 to 4 months later. Hand harvest is required, usually accomplished by undercutting the base of the plant. Scallions are available year-round, but the supply peaks from July through October. California is the leading domestic supplier of scallions. Illinois, Ohio, and New Jersey contribute a small proportion of the crop",

They also can be grilled, braised, or stir- fried alone, or seasoned with ginger and garlic, to make a tasty vegetable dish to serve with rice and grilled meats. The Irish include scallions in a traditional dish called “champ,” which is composed of potatoes and cooked scallions mashed together to produce a savory, green side dish. Nutrient composition Scallions are a good source of vitamin C. The scallion, with its long, straight, narrow green top and white base, is a true but very immature onion. Often called a green onion, in reality it is picked at an even earlier stage than true green onions, usually before it can begin to form a bulb.

Varieties The “string” in “string beans” refers to a string-like fiber that, until the late 19th century, characterized all fresh beans and had to be removed before the beans were eaten. Today, modern hybrid varieties no longer have the “string” and are referred to as snap beans. Many varieties of green snap beans are grown throughout the United States. Variants include pods that are pale yellow, called wax beans. The term “French green bean” is sometimes used to refer to small, young green beans that are cooked and eaten whole (also called haricots or haricots vertes) or to mature green beans that have been cut into diagonal strips. Purple snap beans, available in limited supply, turn green when cooked. Romano beans, also called Italian or Scarlet Runner beans, are sim- ilar to but flatter than snap beans.

The growth habit of snap beans is used to divide them into two varieties: bush beans and pole beans (which must be trained to a pole or trellis). Both are warm-weather vegetables that must be planted after the danger of frost has passed. The beans are harvested when they are rapidly growing, about 8 to 10 days after flowering. At this stage, the color is bright and the pod is fleshy with small, green seeds. Leaving the pods on the plants too long decreases plant yield and results in tough, dull-colored pods.

A third type that is increasing in popularity is the semi-savoy, whose slightly curly leaves provide some of the texture of savoy but are easier to clean. All varieties have the same appearance when cooked. Origin & botanical facts Spinach probably originated in southwest Asia or the western Himalayas, but wild varieties also grow in North Africa and Iran. The leafy vegetable was first culti- vated by the Persians. Its cultivation reached China in the 7th century A.D. and Europe in the 9th century, when it was introduced to Spain by the Arabs, who named it. Today, spinach is grown and enjoyed in many parts of the world. Spinach is an annual plant that requires cool, damp weather and rich, moist soil. Spinach seed can be planted in early spring or in autumn, depending on the variety. Hardier types will survive the winter in well-drained soils and can be harvested until spring. More tender vari- eties are planted in spring, as early as February, for summer harvest. Spinach is ready to be harvested about 6 weeks after planting, when the largest leaves are 6 to 8 inches long. Uses Spinach leaves that are crisp and bright to dark green are best. The leaves can be refrigerated in a plastic bag for 3 days. Spinach can be served raw or cooked. The flat-leaf variety, with its slightly milder flavor, is generally preferred as a raw salad green. Spinach should be cooked very quickly, either by steaming or by sautéing with a minimum of liquid, just until the leaves wilt. The leaves also can be added to soups, casseroles, and stews. A variety of seasonings, such as lemon juice, soy sauce, horseradish, tomato sauce, or nutmeg, add flavor to spinach dishes.

They can range from the patty pan (scallop) variety, which weighs only a couple of ounces, to the pumpkin, which can attain weights of up to 200 pounds. The rind can be smooth, ridged, or bumpy and can range from white or cream-colored to yellow, orange, green, and even light blue. Squash can be cylindrical, bell- or club-shaped, and simply round or oblong. Although wild squash is bitter, cultivated varieties are generally sweeter or bland and have a soft to crunchy texture when cooked. Varieties Squash is generally divided into two basic types, summer and winter, although seasonal distinction is no longer accurate because both types are now available year- round. Winter, or hard-shell, squash is allowed to mature on the plant and has a thick rind; large, tough seeds; and dark- yellow to orange flesh. Summer, or soft- shell, squash, which is harvested before it matures completely, has a more tender rind and lighter-colored flesh. Winter squash types include acorn squash, shaped something like an acorn that tapers at one end, with a dark-green, ridged rind; banana squash, a large, cylinder-shaped squash with a thick, pale skin and finely textured flesh; buttercup squash, a squat, dark-green vegetable with lighter stripes and rather dry flesh; but- ternut squash, shaped like a long bell with a tan rind and mild flavor; and spaghetti squash, an oval, yellow variety whose mild, pale-yellow flesh forms crisp-tex- tured spaghetti-like strands when cooked.

Although edible wild types are no longer known, related species with small, very bitter fruits are still found in this region. Squash was first gathered by indigenous people around 8000 B.C., but apparently only the seeds were eaten, because the fruits were unappealing. Cultivation of squash may have begun around Tehuacan, south of Mexico City, around 3400 B.C. From there, peoples throughout North and South America adopted squash cultiva- tion. By the time squash was introduced to Europe in the 16th century, most of the modern types were already developed. Squash quickly became a staple in the 260 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods diets of European colonists in America. New England settlers adapted the word “squash” from several Indian names for the vegetable, all of which meant “some- thing eaten raw.” Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson cultivated zucchini and other types of summer squash on their Virginia estates.

California and Florida are the primary U.S. producers, and Mexico and Costa Rica contribute sub- stantially to the U.S. supply. Squash is a hardy, warm-weather annual that grows on vines or small bushes with trailing tendrils. Seeds can be sown in seedbeds early in spring or directly into fields later in the season, after danger of frost has passed, in hills of warm, well- fertilized soil. Vines must be trellised to provide support for the heavy fruit. Although most types of squash prefer full sun, winter varieties can tolerate light shade. For ideal growth, the plants require considerable moisture, especial- ly after flowering. Most squash blossoms are yellow or orange, and both male and female flowers form on the same plant. Because the female blooms open for only 1 day, and only from dawn until mid- morning, pollination at the right time and place is critical. In addition, the number of seeds and the size and shape of the fruits are determined by the amount of pollen deposited. Inadequate pollina- tion of summer squash results in small, misshapen fruit or none at all. The first crop of summer squash is ready to har- vest about 50 days after planting, and all of the fruits must be harvested at this stage in order for more to grow. If the fruits are allowed to mature, the plants stop producing. In contrast, winter squash is left on the plant until it matures, a process that takes 95 to 115 days, depending on variety. All are picked after the leaves have turned brown. Uses When selecting winter squash, it is important to choose one that is heavy for its size and has a thick, hard shell. If stored in a cool, dry place, whole winter squash can keep well for several months. Cut pieces should be tightly wrapped and refrigerated. Winter squash is always cooked before eating, usually after the fruit has been cut open and the seeds and fibers scooped out",

Its length ranges from about 5 inches to a foot or more, and it can be several inches wide. Its starchy, rather dry flesh is acrid and actually toxic when raw, but after cooking it is safe to consume and has a somewhat nutty flavor, similar to that of potatoes or water chestnuts. Varieties More than 300 varieties of taro are cul- tivated around the world, both in water and in soil, and vary considerably in color and taste. The two varieties of taro that are most important for food production are the globulifera, also called dasheen, which produces a large number of crisp, easily cut tubers (or corms), and the antiquorum, whose corms are tougher and more spongy. Origin & botanical facts Because taro is an important part of many Asian diets and rituals, the tuber may have originated somewhere on that con- tinent. Whatever its geographic origins, it is most likely one of the oldest food plants. As early as 2000 B.C., taro was brought from southeast Asia to the Pacific rim and northern Asia. Taro is believed to have been brought to Hawaii between 400 and 500 A.D. by the first Marquesan and Tahitian settlers. According to Hawaiian tradition, taro is the staff of life. Taro also was carried westward to Arabia and was an important crop in the Nile Valley by 500 B.C",

Today, taro is a staple in the diets of the people of West Africa, the Caribbean, and the Polynesian Islands. It is grown throughout tropical and subtropical Asia and the Pacific and in parts of Africa and the Americas. Taro is a succulent perennial plant that ranges in height from about 20 inch- es to 6 feet. Young corms develop as off- shoots of the main corm and can produce new plants. Although taro is generally regarded as a bog plant, it can grow in a variety of environments from dry ground to wetlands and can tolerate lighting conditions ranging from deep shade to bright sunlight. Because taro seeds and seedlings do not survive well and the plants rarely flower, propagation is done primarily by planting side corms or by cutting off and planting the top of a large tuber with its shoot.

Indeed, the name “tomatillo” means “little tomato” in Spanish. Like the tomato, it belongs to the nightshade family and is actually a fruit. Globular in shape and between 1 1/2 and 2 inches in diameter, the slightly flattened, shiny fruits are enclosed in light-brown or green, easily removed, parchment-like coverings. The tomatillo has a tangy lemony flavor that is difficult to describe. It has a firmer texture than the tomato, and its flesh is pale green or yellow, depending on the degree of ripeness. Varieties Tomatillos come in two varieties: the sweet and the sharp (or acidic), both of which are available in the United States. The more acidic variety is also known as Tomatilla de Milpa. Origin & botanical facts The tomatillo is a native of Mexico, although it also grows wild in California. Plants reach heights and widths of 3 to 4 feet and have an unusual zigzag shape. The leaves are long and heart-shaped, and the flowers are bell-shaped. Tomatillos are best adapted to warm and dry climates. However, they can be grown as far north as the central midwestern United States. In North America, fruit production begins about 70 days after the plant has sprouted. Tomatillos are available year- round. Uses The tomatillo is almost always used while it is still unripe, because the tangy lemony flavor is lost when the fruit ripens.

Varieties Tomatoes are available in three basic types: small, round cherry tomatoes; plump, oblong plum, or Roma, tomatoes; and round or globe-shaped slicing tomatoes, probably the sweetest and juiciest type. Within each type are numerous varieties, totaling about 4,000. Origin & botanical facts Although the tomato is botanically a fruit, it is prepared and consumed as a vegetable. In fact, because of a tariff dispute, the U.S. Supreme Court officially declared it a veg- etable in 1893. The word “tomato” is derived from the Mexican Nahuatl Indian word “tomatl.” The wild form of the plant, which still flourishes in Mexico and Central and South America, is similar to the domestic cherry tomato. Spanish explorers to Mexico brought tomatoes back to Europe in the 10th century. The first official mention of the fruit appeared in 1544, in the work of Italian botanist Matthiolus, who described a yellow-fruit- ed variety he called pomodoro, meaning “golden apple.” Europeans initially regarded tomatoes with suspicion, because most SERVING SIZE: 1 medium, raw (123 g) Tomato Tomatoes also are available in a variety of processed forms, including canned whole, diced, and puréed. Canned tomato paste is a concentrated form of the fruit’s pulp. Processed tomato sauce in cans or jars is similar to purée, but with seasonings and sometimes fat added. Nutrient composition Tomatoes are a good source of vitamin A (carotenes) and are high in vitamin C. Red tomatoes also contain substantial amounts of lycopene, an antioxidant that may help protect against cancer. The lycopene in cooked or processed toma- toes is more easily absorbed than that in fresh tomatoes. plants of the nightshade family were known to be poisonous. The tomato was not widely accepted as a food until the early 19th century, although even then tomatoes would be cooked for hours to neutralize the toxins they were thought to contain. Raw tomatoes were not consumed until the late 19th century",

Depending on age and variety, turnips can be round or shaped like a top, range in diameter from 2 inches to over a foot, and weigh up to 50 pounds. Their smooth skin can be white, yellow, green, or purple. The white or yellow flesh of the turnip has a slightly sweet, peppery flavor and a crisp texture. Varieties Numerous varieties of turnips are grown for harvest throughout the year. The Purple Top Milan, with flat white roots and purple markings, matures early and is good for winter production, as are the Manchester Market and the yellow- fleshed Golden Ball. The Purple Top White Globe is an old variety with round or flat roots that are reddish purple above ground and white below. The Snowball is a fast-maturing white turnip that generally is sown in spring, while the Tokyo Cross is an all-year crop. The Japanese cultivate long, carrot-shaped turnips called Hinona Kabu.

English and French settlers brought turnips to America. Today, turnips are grown in many parts of the world, includ- ing Canada and the United States, where the leading suppliers are California and New Jersey. Turnips are economical and easy to grow. They thrive in almost any type of soil and store well after harvest. Seeds generally are sown in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked, and additional plantings are done every 2 weeks until about 5 weeks before the temperature is expected to increase to more than 80° Fahrenheit. In late summer, when temperatures begin to cool, successive plantings can be started again until 3 months before night temperatures normally decrease to less than 20° Fahrenheit. Turnips are ready for harvest about 70 days after planting or when the roots are 2 inches in diameter. Uses Firm, unblemished turnips that are small but heavy for their size are the best and sweetest. They can be stored in perfo- rated plastic bags in the refrigerator crisper. Although turnips can be eaten raw, the larger ones may have a strong flavor, which can be reduced by blanch- ing in boiling water for about 5 minutes. Although the root usually is peeled before use, fresh, young turnips can be used with the skins intact. Sliced or cubed raw turnip adds a crunchy texture and a sweet, peppery flavor to green salads. Turnips can be boiled, baked, steamed, pickled, braised in broth, microwaved, stir-fried with other vegetables, or roasted along- side meat or poultry. Cooked turnips can be mashed and served like potatoes or cut up and included in soups, casseroles, and stews. Overcooking should be avoided, because it brings out the vegetable’s strong flavor.

Although the grains eaten by humans belong to a wide range of botanical families, they have the same basic structure (see the illustration on page 20, Chapter 2) and contain these compo- nents, from which plants begin to grow: Bran — This is the outer layer of the grain seed. It’s full of B vitamins, trace minerals, and, especially, fiber. Endosperm — Sometimes referred to as the kernel, the endosperm contains the majority of the material within the seed and is meant to nourish a seedling. The endosperm is where most of the protein, carbohydrates, and small amounts of vita- mins are located. It is composed mainly of starch, and often it is the only part of the grain that is eaten. Germ — The germ is the part of the seed from which the new plant sprouts. As the embryo within the seed, it has the high- est concentration of nutrients, including B vitamins, trace minerals, and some pro- teins. It also contains fat, which increases its perishability. Grains are usually milled before they are used as food. Milling usually means that the bran and any husk surrounding the grain seed (along with the nutrients they contain) are removed. Then the seeds are ground in a process that converts the grain into flour or other products. The product’s use and name often depend on how much of the bran is left. Wheat, for example, can be milled into whole-grain flours that contain all parts of the seed. Refined flours, which are used most often by Western nations, contain only the endosperm: the bran and germ are removed (along with much of the grain’s nutrition). Nearly any grain can be milled and made into products such as bread, cereal, or pasta—food staples worldwide—with varying degrees of success depending on the chemistry of the grain. History has taught us which grains work best and in what combinations. Gluten, which is found in grain protein, gives bread its springy texture",

It becomes stretchy and thickens when liquid is added C ereal grains are the fruit of plants belonging to the grass family (Gramineae). Ten thousand years ago, wheat underwent spontaneous mutations causing this grass to hang onto its seed rather than scatter it to the wind. Although this change was not in the interests of the wheat from the standpoint of its own reproduction, it enabled humans to store seed for the winter. The calorie density of grains prevented starvation and so played an important role in human history worldwide. In China, rice was domesticated about 6,500 years ago, and in the New World corn was domesticated about 3,500 years ago. Until the past century, most grains were consumed as “whole” grains. In other words, the grain kernels were intact — not stripped of their vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Whole grains provide fiber, protein, complex carbohydrates, lignans, phytates, other phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals. Fat-soluble vitamins are found in the germ of the grain, and B vitamins and phytochemicals are found in the husk or bran. Grain and grain products are also naturally low in fat. Whole grains can be consumed plain as hot cereals, used in pilafs, added to baked goods, and eaten in dozens of other ways. Hundreds of products are made from grain. Two of the main ones —bread and pasta — are diet staples in nearly every culture on every continent, from couscous in North Africa to soba (buckwheat noodles) in Japan.

Refined wheat flour has both the bran and the germ removed. Many grain products are enriched (see Chapter 4, “Fortified” and “Enriched,” page 92), meaning nutrients originally found in the grain are added back to the product during processing. But not all the nutrients are returned. Insoluble fiber is milled away when the bran is removed, and antioxidants usually are not added back into refined flours. Phytochemicals also may be missing in refined products. The bottom line is that even though refined grains are a good source of many nutrients, whole grains are better.

The text that follows provides more detailed information about specific grains and the foods made from them. The chapter is organized into two sections: • Grains • Grain Products bulk, check whether the store has a rapid turnover of that particular product. There may not be a great demand for bulgur in supermarkets, for example, and so the prod- uct may have been on the shelf for some time. In contrast, specialty food markets or those specializing in natural foods may have greater demand for the product, sell more of it, and therefore have a fresher product. Grains also should smell fresh and appear clean and free of debris. Storage Because grains may attract insects or may become moldy if they become moist, keep them in tightly closed, moisture-proof containers. Grains can be stored at room temperature, but they will remain fresh longer if stored in the refrigerator, where they will keep for several months. Most grains can be kept much longer if stored in the freezer. They do not need to be thawed before cooking. Cooked grain may be stored in the refrigerator for several days and then reheated. Preparation Whole grains are hard and dry. Thus, cook- ing involves not only heating them but also rehydrating them. For that reason, whole grains, with few exceptions, are cooked in liquid. Here’s a traditional method for doing so: • Bring water (or other liquid, such as a stock) to a boil. Many cooks use a ratio of two to three parts water to one part grain. • Add grains and other seasonings. • Cover mixture and reduce to a simmer. • Simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed. • Remove mixture from heat and drain excess liquid if necessary. Let sit for approx- imately 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. BEYOND THE BASICS Innovative uses of grains include the production of modified starches, caloric sweeteners, and fat substitutes",

Several food enzymes are pro- duced by fermentation based on grain. Wheat gluten may be used to produce flavor enhancers such as glutamate or diet supplements such as glutamine. There is also a vast range of industrial applications. None of these, however, are likely to overtake in importance the role of grains in feeding the world. Grains Amaranth Amaranth was one of the main food sources for the Aztecs, who also used it in religious rituals. Cultivation ended almost com- pletely after Spanish conquistadors made growing the plant a punishable offense. Today, both farmers and anyone interested in nutrition are showing increasing interest in the plant because it has more protein (15 percent to 18 percent of calories) than most other grains (8 to 15 percent of calories). It also contains more lysine and methionine, amino acids not provided by many com- mon grains. Combined with other grains, it can provide a complete balance of amino acids. Amaranth is also a source of calcium and magnesium and contains more iron than almost any other grain. The amaranth plant has long clusters of red flowers and grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. It produces tiny seeds—up to 500,000 per plant. These seeds can be cooked and eaten as a grain or popped, sprouted, or ground into flour that has a strong, nutty flavor. Amaranth flour can range from a light yellow to dark violet, although most amaranth flour sold in stores is buff-colored. Pasta can be made from amaranth flour, and amaranth oil is obtained from the plant’s seeds. The green leaves and stalk of amaranth (also called pigweed) can be cooked and eaten. The leaves have a taste similar to that of spinach. Preparation Tips Amaranth flour does not contain gluten, which means baked goods containing it will not rise as desired and will be crumbly",

Barley has a tough husk surrounding the grain seed which must be removed before it is edible. Barley is a source of soluble fiber, niacin, phosphorus, magnesium, and iron. Barley grains are usually off-white, but the color may range from black to purple. How the grain is milled determines its nutritional content. Nutrients are most concentrated near the bran. Therefore, the more milling the barley undergoes, the less nutritious it is. Types of barley sold in stores include: Flaked barley—As its name suggests, barley flakes are grains that have been flat- tened. They resemble rolled oats. Pot barley or Scotch barley—This type of barley is coarsely ground, but it loses most of its nutrients because almost the entire husk is removed. Pearled barley—So-named because processed barley grains are the same size as pearls and ivory-colored, pearled barley is processed multiple times to scour or polish off the outer husk and the bran. The result is a barley that cooks much more quickly than other types of barley. Hulled barley—Hulled barley has only the outer husk removed and still contains most of its bran. This makes it one of the most nutritious types of barley available. Barley flour—Barley flour is simply barley grains ground very fine. It is darker than refined white flour and has a delicate, nutty flavor. Supermarkets typically do not carry a wide variety of barley products, although pearled barley and prepared barley soups are easy to find. Health food stores or specialty food markets are more likely to carry less refined barley products. or pastries. Because it has a nutty, assertive flavor, you may want to experiment some- what with how much amaranth flour to add to recipes.

Or, they can be popped by adding them a tablespoon at a time to a hot, ungreased skillet. They take just a few min- utes to pop. Serving Suggestions In addition to using amaranth in baked goods as described above, amaranth can be substituted for flour in pancake or waffle recipes. Cinnamon particularly comple- ments its flavor in both of these breakfast favorites. Amaranth leaves can be substi- tuted for spinach in salads or cooked dishes. Popped amaranth seeds can be used as a garnish or topping or in breading recipes. Barley Barley, an annual plant that grows to a height of 1 to 4 feet, is hardy enough to withstand various growing conditions. For this reason, throughout history it has been cultivated as a food crop and remains a staple in many nations, particularly in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Today, however, much of the barley produced in Western nations is fed to animals or used in the production of beer or distilled liquor. An enzyme in malt made from barley transforms the starch in beer or liquor mashes into sugars that alcohol-producing yeast can feed on and, therefore, ferment, a process that leads to the production of alcohol. Given the health benefits of barley, its versatility, and its pleasing, lightly nutty Preparation Tips Less refined barley should be soaked several hours before cooking. Generally, these types of barley are cooked for about an hour over low heat in 3 or 4 cups of water for each cup of barley. Refined types of barley, such as pearled barley, do not need to be soaked and can be cooked in about a half hour. Barley flour has a low gluten content. It must be combined with higher-gluten flours (such as wheat) in baked goods or they will not rise as desired",

Barley readily absorbs the flavors of the liquid it is cooked in, and thus it is an excellent addition to soups and stews, where it also acts as a thickening agent. Barley also can be served on its own as a hot cereal—it is excellent topped off by plain yogurt and fruit. Barley makes an excellent base for an entrée at lunch or dinner when cooked in chicken, beef, or vegetable stock and then mixed with steamed vegetables.

Recent studies have linked various phytochemicals in buck- wheat with potential health benefits. Rutin, a flavonoid found in buckwheat bran, is being studied for a possible role in manag- ing blood cholesterol levels. Fagopyritols found in buckwheat may have a favorable effect on blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Regular consumption of buckwheat also has been shown to lower blood pressure. However, further research is necessary to confirm these benefits. Preparation Tips Because buckwheat flour is gluten-free, it must be mixed with flours that contain gluten, such as wheat flour, in baked goods. Otherwise, the foods will not rise as desired. To prepare kasha, add 1 cup of buckwheat groats to a heated skillet and add to it a beaten egg white. The egg separates the kernels as they cook, which prevents the groats from sticking together. This ensures that kasha will have a consistency that is similar to that of rice. Stir the kasha and egg mixture until each grain is separate and dry. Then, add 2 cups of boiling liquid— either stock or water—and a dash of salt. Simmer the mixture for 30 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.

Corn can be eaten in several ways. It can be served fresh and still on the cob. Canning or freezing can preserve fresh kernels. Dried kernels can be roasted or popped. Corn can be ground into coarse meal or flour that is made into cornbread, tortillas, pancakes, or waffles. Oil derived from corn is used widely for cooking. Starch derived from corn is often used as a thickening agent in gravies, soups, and other dishes. Tiny baby corn is popular in Asian dishes and is sold in cans or jars. Corn is also fermented and is the basis for bourbon and whiskey. The ever-popular cornflake cereal was invented by the Kellogg brothers of cereal fame in 1894. According to legend, they discovered the process of making cornflakes by accident when they passed corn kernels that had been left too long in cooking water through rollers, resulting in flakes. Although corn is the fundamental food plant of the United States, most of the crop is used for feeding animals or for manu- facturing purposes. Corn grown for those purposes is often referred to as “field” corn. grains native to the Western Hemisphere, where it has been cultivated for centuries.

    "content": "In Europe, the word “corn” is the common term used to describe many cereal grains. However, after coming to the New World, Europeans began to use the word “maize” to refer to corn itself. The word “maize” is derived from the American Indian word “mahiz.” To this day, Europeans call corn “maize,” and Americans call it “corn.” Corn plants grow to a height of 6 to 10 feet. The tall plants, with their long, droop- ing leaves, are a common sight throughout the U.S. Midwest, where most of the world’s supply is grown. The plant pro- duces ears of corn that measure 6 to 12 inches, and each ear has numerous long, slender threads called silk. Corn kernels can be white, orange, red, purple, blue, black, or brown, according to the variety. Most of the corn grown today is a golden yellow. Corn has a wide range of uses and, although less nutritious than many grains, it is extremely versatile and still a good food choice. Nutritionally speaking for humans, corn provides a good source of fiber, phosphorus, vitamin C, and thiamin. Numerous hybrid varieties of corn have become available in the past decades. Preparation Tips The key to serving corn on the cob is to buy the freshest possible. When the ear is plucked from the stalk, the natural sugar in it begins a gradual conversion to starch, which makes the corn less sweet and, there- fore, less tasty. Look for husks around the ear of corn that are green, plump, tightly wrapped, and free of any obvious insect infestation. Before buying corn, peel back the husk slightly to check for plump, pale, and moist-looking kernels. At home, the green husk and silk are usually removed before cooking. Traditionally, corn on the cob is cooked by placing ears in a pot of boiling water for 4 to 7 minutes or in a vegetable steamer for 4 to 6 minutes. Corn on the cob also can be cooked in a microwave oven. To do so, wrap each husked ear in waxed paper and place on a paper towel",

Cook on the highest power setting for 3 to 5 minutes for one ear, 5 to 7 minutes for two ears, and 9 to 12 min- utes for four ears. Corn on the cob can be roasted in its husk on the grill or in the oven. (The silk must first be removed, how- ever, and the husk replaced after this is done.) Before roasting, soak the ear in water for about 5 minutes. Then place the corn on the grill or in the oven. Cooking times vary but range from 10 to 15 minutes on a hot grill or 20 to 30 minutes in an oven set at 350° Fahrenheit. Avoid corn that is sold in displays exposed to direct sunlight or high temper- atures because heat speeds up the process of converting sugar to starch. Serving Suggestions Instead of flavoring corn with butter or salt, try other seasonings. Pepper, herbs, or lemon juice complement corn’s flavor without adding unnecessary sodium, fat, or calories. Corn also mixes well with other vegetables. Popped corn (see sidebar: Putting the “Pop” in Popcorn, this page) makes an excellent snack as long as it is not drenched in butter and salt. Flax Flax is an ancient crop. Native to Eurasia, its first recorded use was in Babylon about 3000 B.C. There, it was cultivated for food, and its seeds were usually ground into flour or meal. The plant also was used to make fabric for clothing. (These days, linen comes from flax.) Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician, wrote of using flaxseed for the relief of abdominal pain. The greatest of all medieval kings, Charlemagne, considered flax so healthful that he passed laws requiring its consumption. Nutrition researchers have identified several substances in flaxseed that appear to have health benefits: lignans, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids. Lignans are phyto- estrogens that are thought to bind to estro- gen receptors in the body. Phytoestrogens may have a role in preventing hormonally related cancers of the breast, endometrium (lining of the uterus), and prostate",

Flaxseed also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber (about 3.3 grams of total fiber in 1 tablespoon of flaxseed). About one-third of the fiber is soluble. Studies have found that the soluble fiber in flaxseed, like that found in oat bran and fruit pectin, can help lower cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber also has been found to help regulate blood sugar levels.

Whole (or ground) flaxseed can replace some of the flour in bread, muffin, pancake, and cookie recipes. Because of its high fat content, it also can be used to replace part or all of the fat in baked goods recipes. (One cup of flaxseed may replace 1/3 cup fat.) Time in the oven should be adjusted to allow for more rapid browning when flaxseed is used in baked goods. Flaxseed oil also is readily available and may be substituted for other oils. Serving Suggestions Whole flaxseeds have a nutty taste and can be sprinkled over salads, soups, yogurt, or cereals. Flaxseed meal particularly com- plements the flavor of bran muffins. thirds of the fiber in flaxseed is insoluble, which aids in digestion and waste elimina- tion. Flaxseed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, which is both an essential fatty acid and an omega-3 fatty acid. Researchers are inter- ested in omega-3 fatty acids for their roles in proper infant growth and development, in reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke (regulation of cholesterol, triglyc- erides, blood pressure, blood clotting), and in immune and inflammatory disorders.

PUTTING THE “POP” IN POPCORN Popcorn is a special hard variety of dried corn that pops open and puffs when it is heated. The kernel has enough internal moisture to become steam, and the kernel explodes because the steam has nowhere to go. Different types of popcorn can be different colors. Once popped, though, they’re all white or yellow. Popcorn is an excellent snack food. It is high in complex carbohydrates, a source of some fiber, and, depending on how it is served, low in fat and calories. When pur- chasing microwave popcorn, check labels for saturated fat content. Try to buy reduced-fat or “lite” varieties. Try popping your own and seasoning it with a pinch of salt instead of adding unnecessary fat and calories by drizzling butter over the popcorn. Alternative season- ings include onion or garlic powders or reduced-fat grated cheese. 276 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods cuisine. In the United States, sorghum molasses is used as syrup at the table and in baked goods. Teff was grown almost exclusively in Ethiopia until the past decade, when it was introduced in Western markets. Often thought of as a “famine food,” teff is also grown and distributed by humani- tarian agencies to relieve world hunger. Millet has a strong, nutty flavor that may take some time to appreciate. Finely ground millet is used by Ethiopians to make fermented, spongy flat bread, by Indians to make crepe-like roti, and by the Masai in Africa to make beer.

It can be served as a hot cereal and in dishes such as pilaf. Like barley, millet can be added to soups and stews. Oats Oats grow best in cool, moist climates and thrive in poor soils. Given these advantages, it is understandable why oats have been a food source for both humans and animals for centuries. There are several hundred varieties of oats, which are divided into two classes: winter and summer oats. Whole oat grains are usually “hairy” and can vary from white and yellow to gray, red, or black. The grains, which are small and shaped like a thin, elongated football, are cleaned, dried, and roasted, and the hull (the tough outer covering) is removed. The bran and the germ, however, are left intact, which means that they keep most of their original nutrients. Oats are especially rich in the soluble fiber beta- glucan, which may play a role in reducing blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. Oats are also a source of antioxidants. Different types of processed oats and oat products include the following: Oat groats—whole oats that have been hulled and roasted. Groats take about 30 to 40 minutes to cook. Steel-cut oats—Whole oats that have been roasted and then cut into bits. This reduces cooking time to about 15 minutes. They are sometimes known as Scottish or Irish oats or pinhead oats. Old-fashioned rolled oats—These are oat kernels that are steamed and then DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF… What Is Hominy? Hominy is the starchy endosperm of maize (corn) kernels. It can be thought of as the “naked” kernels that remain after the tough hull (pericarp) and oily germ have been removed",

This process not only loosens the hulls but also unbinds the vitamin niacin and makes it absorbable in the digestive tract. In its dry form, hominy is sold either cracked (samp) or ground (grits). Hominy also is sold canned and ready to eat. In Mexico, a form of corn similar to hominy is used to make tortillas. Annual consumption of corn in Mexico is about 400 pounds per person (about 1 pound per day), and it provides up to 70 percent of a person’s daily calorie intake. In the United States, the most common form of hominy is called grits. Grits are cooked with water or milk until thick and mushy. Often eaten as porridge or a side dish or in a casserole, grits are served hot or chilled and sometimes cut into squares and fried. Hominy is a good source of complex carbohydrates and soluble fiber. Millet Millet is the oldest of grains. And although it is often used in the United States as bird feed, millet is one of the main food sources for many developing nations. There are many different species of millet, which is tiny, has an oblong-spherical shape, and ranges from pale yellow to reddish orange. Unlike most grains, which form ears, most varieties of millet form panicles, or berry-shaped heads. Millet berries are small and range from white, gray, or yellow to red or reddish brown. Common millet is grown worldwide and is used mainly for human consumption and animal feed. Foxtail millet is also grown in a variety of areas and is often used for birdseed or, in Russia, to make beer. Pearl millet is grown primarily in India. Varieties that are more familiar to North Americans include sorghum and teff. Sorghum is widely grown in the American South and included there in regional flattened into flakes to allow them to be cooked more quickly.

It can be purchased and used separately, but it may be a part of other oat products. Preparation Tips Old-fashioned oats and quick-cooking oats usually can be interchanged in recipes. Instant oats, however, are not interchange- able because the additional processing they undergo softens the oats so much that, when combined with liquid, they can make baked goods mushy or gooey. Most types of processed oats are cooked by simmering them in water (steel-cut oats require two parts water for one part oats; for all other types of oats, use one part water for one part oats ) until they are softened and cooked.

Quinoa It is hailed as the super grain of the future, but the accolades are a little misleading. Quinoa (a name supposedly derived from the Spanish word for “fantastic”) is not really a grain. It is the fruit of a plant that belongs to the same botanical family as beets. The quinoa plant reaches a height of 3 to 10 feet and produces flat, pointed seeds that range from buff to russet to black. So why all the praise for quinoa? Quinoa is relatively easy to cultivate and withstands poor soil conditions and alti- tude. It also packs a nutritional punch in its tiny seeds. It contains more protein than most grains and offers a more evenly bal- anced array of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. It is higher in minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, copper, zinc, and iron, than many grains. Quinoa seeds can be cooked or ground into flour. Several types of pasta are made from quinoa flour. The leaves of the plant also are edible, and the seeds can be sprouted and eaten. Preparation Tips Quinoa is cooked in the same way as rice, although it cooks in about half the time. Its flavor is delicate, and some describe it as hazelnut-like. Before cooking, it is important to rinse quinoa seeds until the water runs clear. They are covered with a bitter, powdery resin that can result in an unpleasant taste if it is not removed. Quinoa flour has a low gluten content. It cannot be used alone in baked goods because they will not rise properly. Serving Suggestions Quinoa is cooked like rice and makes an excellent substitute for it. “Toasting” the quinoa grains in a hot skillet before boil- ing gives it a roasted flavor. Adding cooked vegetables and fresh herbs also complements its delicate flavor. Quinoa flour can be used in many baked goods. Quinoa also makes an excellent hot cereal and can be added to soups and stews. Quinoa pasta is cooked and used like traditional types of pasta",

Rice Most typically viewed as a side dish in Western nations, rice is the main entrée when the rest of the world sits down to eat, providing up to half the calories in a typical daily diet in many Asian countries. Rice is also a staple in Africa. Most of the world’s rice is grown in Asia. The plant, which grows from 8 to 12 feet in height, can withstand a wide range of climate conditions, but it grows best in hot, humid areas. Branching stems from the plant produce flowers, which form the rice grains when fertilized. There are more than 8,000 varieties of rice. Rice is commercially classified by its grain size: Short-grain (round-grain) rice—Short- grain rice is round or oval and less than 1/5 inch long. It has a higher starch content that results in this rice being sticky after cooking. This kind of rice is also called 278 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Italian dishes, and aromatic rices. Generally, aromatic rices—sometimes referred to as perfumed rices—are long-grain types of rice and have a distinct flavor typically com- pared to that of popcorn or nuts. Basmati rice has a nut-like aroma and a rich, buttery flavor. It is widely used in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. Jasmine rice is cultivated primarily in Southeast Asia and has a soft texture. Glutenous, or sweet, rice has a high starch content and is used in Asian cooking to thicken sauces and make dumplings and for some types of desserts. Rice also can be milled into fine, powdery flour, which can be used in baked goods. Store rice in an airtight container. Brown rice, which naturally contains oil, keeps for about 6 months, but it is subject to rancidity. Its shelf life can be extended, however, by storing it in the refrigerator in an airtight container. White rice can keep for up to a year. Cooked rice can be stored in the refrig- erator for several days, but it will last for 6 to 8 months when kept in the freezer. Preparation Tips Preparation varies according to the type of rice used",

White rice is the most popular form of rice. One reason is that the milling process, which removes the husk, bran, and germ, makes the rice cook more rapidly and extends its shelf life. Unfortunately, it’s also the least nutritious form of rice. In Western nations, rice is enriched, meaning nutrients such as iron, niacin, riboflavin, and thiamin are returned to the rice before it is sold to con- sumers. Parboiled rice has been processed to preserve some of the nutrients during milling. Instant rice is white rice that has been milled, cooked, and then dehydrated. It takes about 5 minutes to cook, and its nutritional content is generally equivalent to that of white rice because most instant rice is enriched. Specialty types of rice include arborio rice, which is round white rice used in pearl or glutenous rice (although there is no gluten in it). Medium-grain rice—Medium-grain rice is up to 1/4 inch in length. It remains firm and light when cooked and retains more moisture than long-grain rice. Long-grain rice—This rice is more than 1/4 inch in length. The grains are much longer than they are wide. They tend to remain separate when cooked and are drier than shorter-grain rice. Most rice grown in the United States is long-grain rice. Each type of rice comes in both brown and white forms. Brown rice has only the tough, fibrous hull removed from the rice grain during processing. Because of this, it retains most of its nutrients, which include fiber (bran), potassium, phosphorus, and trace minerals. It also is chewier, has a stronger flavor, and takes longer to cook.

One way is to take the desired spice or herb, mix it with a small amount of cooking oil (about a teaspoon or less), and add it to the water just before adding the rice. Spices and herbs also can be added to rice after it is cooked. Spices and herbs that pair well with rice include cumin, caraway, basil, cilantro, mint, and parsley. cooked by adding it to liquid (two parts water to one part rice) and then simmering it until the liquid is absorbed. Both brown rice and parboiled rice may require longer cook- ing times; brown rice may need to simmer for up to 40 minutes, for example. Cooks differ about whether rice should be rinsed before cooking. Some believe that rinsing rice prevents stickiness. However, rinsing domestic rice can wash off nutrients added during processing. A quick tip: to prevent stickiness, don’t stir the rice while you are cooking it. Cooking rice in a vegetable, beef, or chicken stock is a low-fat, low-calorie way to add flavor to rice before serving. Rice flour is gluten- free. It must be combined with higher- gluten flours (such as wheat) in baked goods or they will not rise as desired. Serving Suggestions Few grains are as versatile or well loved as rice. It can be served as a pilaf, which can be jazzed up by adding cut-up vegetables and seasonings. Rice can be added to soups, stuffings, and salads. In particular, it makes an excellent replacement for potatoes. Rice also serves as the base for vegetarian dishes. Used as the foundation for stir-fry dishes, it offers the perfect opportunity to make a grain the centerpiece of a meal, instead of having the usual—and less healthful—focus on meat, poultry, or seafood. Rice flour can be used to thicken sauces. A note about prepared rice mixes: although popular, they’re often more expen- sive than plain rice and typically contain a significant amount of sodium.

Grains 279 may be used whole, cracked, or rolled like oats, but they are generally ground into flour. Rye flour comes in several different varieties. Light rye flour has most of the bran removed. Dark rye flour retains most of the bran and germ and is a source of magnesium, trace minerals, folic acid, thiamin, and niacin. Dark rye flour is traditionally used to make the dark, strongly flavored German bread called pumpernickel. Rye also is used in many alcoholic beverages, including whiskey and some types of vodka. Rye Rye belongs to the same botanical family as wheat and barley. The plant is indigenous to Europe and Asia. The plant itself is often bushy at the base and stands 5 to 8 feet high. Rye grows well in areas where the soil is too poor and the climate too cool for wheat. Rye grains have the same elongated shape as wheat grains. The color ranges from buff to gray. The husks are removed during milling, but usually much of the germ and bran remain, which enhances the nutritional value of rye products. The grains Varieties of rice (clockwise from the top): jasmine, basmati, arborio, white, and brown (center). 280 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods work for almost all baked goods and pasta. Wheat also is used in the manufacture of beer and whiskey. The three major types of wheat are: Hard—Hard wheat is high in protein (10 to 14 percent). It is also high in gluten content, which gives the flour elasticity and makes it particularly suitable for yeast breads. Soft—The low-protein (6 to 10 percent) flour is lower in gluten. It’s often used to make “softer” baked goods, such as cakes. Durum—This is the hardest wheat grown and is highest in gluten. Despite that, it is not used in baked goods",

Wheat Wheat is among the oldest of grain crops. Major wheat-producing areas include the United States, whose Great Plains are con- sidered the “breadbasket of the world,” Canada, China, western Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Australia. Wheat is an annual plant that grows between 2 and 4 feet high, depending on the variety of wheat grown and growing conditions. The grains are contained in a bearded spike developed by the plant. Unlike many other grains, it can be difficult to cultivate. Nevertheless, it is easily one of the most common grains grown around the world. Only rice rivals it in production. Most of the wheat grown in the world is eaten by humans—often in the form of bread. Wheat’s high gluten content makes it particularly well adapted for this use. Because of this, wheat flour is the frame- Like most grain products, rye should be stored in airtight containers to retard spoilage. Preparation Tips Whole rye grains are often cooked in the same way as rice, that is, simmered in water until they are tender. However, rye grains should be pre-soaked in water several hours to speed up cooking. Rye flour has little gluten, and therefore breads in which it is the main flour are denser because they do not rise as well. However, rye contains several long-chained 5-carbon sugars (pen- tosans), which have a high water-binding capacity. This trait helps rye bread retain moisture better than wheat bread. Serving Suggestions Use dark rye flour to make your own pumpernickel bread. Also, substitute dark rye flour in place of some of the other flour in baked goods to add a nutty flavor. Traditional methods for growing rice include the manual tasks of sowing the seeds, transplanting, and harvesting by hand",

    "content": "THE RYE AND ERGOT CONNECTION The poor soil and moist climate in which rye grows are also favorable conditions for the growth of a fungus called ergot, which can grow on moisture-laden rye kernels. Ergot has long been known to have medicinal properties, and today it is used in medications given during childbirth to promote contractions of the uterus and control bleeding. It also is used in some migraine headache medications. Ingesting too much of it, however, may lead to hallucinogenic effects. A derivative of ergot is lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Modern milling processes clean rye grains and remove any that may be contaminated with ergot. Wheat also is classified according to the time of year it is planted. Spring wheat, as its name suggests, is sown in the spring. Winter wheat is grown in areas with more moderate winters and is sown in the late fall. Literally thousands of products are made from wheat—flour, bread, and pasta are just the fundamental items. Whole- wheat products, however, are the most nutritious because they have not been milled as extensively as more refined products. Whole-wheat products include the following: Cracked wheat—As the name implies, this is wheat seed that has been broken into small pieces. It can be finely or coarsely cracked. Bulgur—A popular ingredient in many Middle East dishes, bulgur is a type of cracked wheat that has been steam-cooked and dried. Because of this, it does not require as much cooking time as other whole-wheat products. Bulgur is used for making tabbouleh (a well-known Middle East cuisine favorite), cereal, and pilaf. It is available in a variety of grinds, from fine to coarse. Grains 281 is added to bread for extra crunch and nutrition. Wheat flakes make excellent addi- tions to hot cereals or baked goods. Wheat groats have a strong, nut-like flavor. They are used in bread doughs or soups or are served on their own as a pilaf, for example. Wheat groats also can be eaten sprouted.

Farina can be used in dumplings, main dishes, or desserts, particularly in Indian and Greek cuisine. Wheat flakes—Also known as rolled wheat, these are wheat seeds that have been flattened. They look like rolled oats, although they are slightly larger and thicker. Although it might be easy to picture these as the main component of many cold break- fast cereals, wheat flakes are not the product used in these cereals. Groats or wheat berries—These are other names for wheat seeds sold whole. Because they have undergone very little milling, these are among the most nutri- tious of wheat products. Preparation Tips If buying whole-wheat kernels in bulk, wash the product before use to remove debris. Those that are packaged typically do not need to be rinsed. The various forms of whole wheat that are used in hot cereals or served as side dishes are generally cooked by adding water to them and simmering until the water is gone. Cooking time varies, although a general rule is that cracked wheat requires less cooking time than whole wheat. Most whole-wheat products have cooking instructions on their labels. Because the wheat germ contains fat, whole-wheat grain and products made from it should be refrig- erated to prevent spoiling.

This processing is unfortunate because the bran is an excellent source of insoluble fiber. Cooks often use it to add taste and nutrition to meat loaf, casseroles, and baked goods. Endosperm—The endosperm constitutes the majority of the material within the wheat seed and is meant to nourish a seedling. Most of the protein and carbohydrates and small amounts of vitamins are in the endosperm. It is composed mainly of starch and is the main ingredient in wheat flour and other wheat products. WHAT IS TRITICALE? Triticale is a 20th-century hybrid that is a cross between wheat and rye. It combines the nutritional benefits of both: the high protein content of wheat and the high lysine content of rye. Several varieties are under cultivation. Researchers are studying ways to improve the yield and adaptability of this unique crop. Wild Rice Not really a rice, although closely related to it genetically, wild rice is actually an aquatic grain. It is the seed of a marsh grass that grows in the northern Great Lakes area of the United States. It is known for its hazelnut-like flavor, dark-brown color, and chewy texture. American Indians, who once waged wars over areas where wild rice grew abundantly, have harvested it for centuries. These indigenous peoples called wild rice “mahnomen,” meaning “precious gift from the gods.” First domesticated successfully in the 1950s after many attempts to mimic the moist, murky conditions where the wild rice-producing grass grows best, wild rice is now grown commercially in the Upper Midwest and in California. The crop is now worth more than $20 million annually. Most wild rice is eaten whole, but it also can be ground into flour. 282 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Grain Products Bread Bread is such a fundamental food that the word “bread” itself is often equivalent to “food” or “money” in many parts of the world",

    "content": "Although it is a simple food, bread requires the conversion of grain into flour, leavening ingredients, and a means of baking. Bread also plays a role in many customary rituals, such as the breaking and blessing of bread in religious rites. Although there are hundreds of differ- ent types of bread, the main types are leavened (meaning raised) and unleavened breads. There are also quick breads, in which baking powder or baking soda is used as a leavening agent. The main ingredients in most breads are the following: Flour—The powdery material from ground grain, flour is the main ingredient in bread. Because of its high gluten content, wheat flour lends itself best to bread making. The gluten, when mixed with water, gives the bread dough elasticity. This allows the dough to expand when the yeast ferments, yet it is strong enough to contain it. The result is light and airy bread. Any grain can be used to make bread. In coun- tries where wheat is less readily available, grains that are used include millet, barley, rye, and oats. Liquid—Water is the most common liquid in bread making, but beer, milk, and fruit juice also can be used. Liquid is needed in raised bread to allow the gluten in flour to do its work. The type of liquid used can result in the bread having different properties. Water, for example, will result in a thick crust. Yeast—Yeast is a one-celled organism that is used to leaven bread. Unleavened breads and quick breads do not contain Preparation Tips Wash wild rice before cooking. The basic preparation recipe for wild rice is to place 1 cup of wild rice in a saucepan with 4 cups of water (chicken or beef stock can be added for flavor). Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat. Simmer the rice covered for 40 to 50 minutes until it is tender and most of the grains have split evenly.

When yeast ferments the substances naturally present in flour, it produces a gas called carbon dioxide. Bread rises as the gluten in the dough traps this gas. Yeast is also responsible for bread’s delicious aroma and gives it its flavor. Salt—Bread can be made without this staple, but salt does several things when it is added to dough. It adds flavor, helps strengthen the gluten, and helps regulate yeast production. Optional ingredients—Two ingredients that do not have to be added to bread but often are include sugar and fat. Sugar pro- vides a ready food source for the multiply- ing yeast, adds flavor to bread, and helps it stay moist. Fat is often used in commercial bread making. It adds flavor and tender- ness. In addition, it gives the dough more elastic qualities, allowing it to expand more. The most common type of bread eaten in the United States is made from refined white flour. Although enriched during processing and baking, not all of the nutrients lost when the flour is refined are returned to it. A more nutritious choice is whole-wheat bread. Whole-wheat bread is made from flour ground from whole-wheat grains—meaning the bran and the germ also are used. Make sure the label indicates that only whole-wheat flour was used. Otherwise, whole wheat or cracked wheat may have been added to white flour. Common types of breads are as follows: Bagels—Once only an ethnic delicacy, bagels have gone mainstream and are now enjoyed by just about everyone as a break- fast main course, the foundation for a sand- wich, or a nutritious snack.

Coating the dough with egg whites before baking gives the crust its characteristic prop- erties. The bread is traditionally made with- out preservatives. Pumpernickel—Rye flour gives this bread its hearty flavor and its dense, chewy texture. Rye flour does not contain as much gluten as wheat flour and, therefore, the bread does not rise as much as bread made with wheat flour. Caramel or molasses gives it its dark color. Rye bread—Rye bread also is made with rye flour, but the flour is usually mixed with wheat flour during preparation. Look at labels to determine how much rye flour a bread contains. As little as 3 percent is all that is needed to call it rye bread. Sourdough—Bread aficionados know this bread for its characteristic tangy taste and smell.

Keep in mind the gluten content of the flour you are working with, however. Otherwise, the result may not be as desired. It may take a few tries to find out how much rye flour, or wheat bran, you should add. Loaves of bread should be stored wrapped to keep them from drying out. Sliced bread will keep for up to a week at room temperature and for about 2 months in the freezer. A quick note about nutrition: toasting bread can reduce the amount of some key nutrients by as much as 20 percent. Serving Suggestions Bread can be used as slices, cubes, or crumbs. Hollowed-out loaves of bread make simple, edible containers for soups or dips. Bread cut into small pieces was the most common thickening agent in early European cooking, particularly poultry stuffing. Bread crumbs are often used to add body to foods, such as steamed pudding, sausages, and meat loaf. Bread croutons, or “little crusts,” are added to soups and salads for texture and taste. Try using different breads—such as pita breads—to give sandwiches a different twist.

Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of a flattened, toasted wheat flake in the late 1800s, would probably be surprised at the enthusiasm for his invention and the deriv- atives of it. For several decades after Kellogg’s wheat flake was introduced (followed closely by corn flakes and shredded wheat), marketers touted the cereals as the key to both health and vitality. Today, corn, wheat, oats, and even some lesser-known grains such as amaranth and quinoa are puffed, popped, baked, shredded, or processed into “Os,” letters of the alphabet, and even in the shape of popular cartoon characters. Unfortunately, cereal’s reputation as a healthful food has suffered. Many cereals are a wise breakfast choice, but too many of them (particularly children’s cereals) also have sugar and artificial flavorings and colors added to them. Granola-based cereals and many that purport to be rich in oat bran or fiber also may be high in fat. Checking the labels to see what you are getting is always a good idea. One ingredient to look for in particular is hydrogenated fat, which contains a type of fat called trans fatty acids. Trans fatty acids have been linked to an increased risk of car- diovascular disease. Preparation Tips Consider the nutrition of the other main ingredient in a bowl of cereal: milk. The type you choose can have a major effect on the nutrition of a meal based on a bowl of cereal. Choose skim milk. Skim milk reduces calories and saturated fat signifi- cantly yet provides the same nutrients as whole milk. Whole grains for hot cereal can be purchased at specialty stores and in the natural food aisle of many supermarkets. Follow label instructions for cooking. PALMITATE IN CEREALS Many people, particularly those who are watching fat intake closely, wonder whether palmitate, a common ingredient in cereals, is the same as palm oil.

Palmitate is a form of palmitic acid, one of the saturated fatty acids found in palm oil. Vegetable fats, such as soybean oil, also contain palmitic acid. However, cereal manufacturers add a very small amount of palmitate to stabilize vitamin A and maintain the nutrient's potency. You will often see the ingredient listed as “vitamin A palmitate.” There is no need to worry about the tiny amounts of palmitate added to cereals. Serving Suggestions Try adding cold cereal to reduced-fat or nonfat yogurt for a crunchy, creamy treat. Or, top off cold cereal with sliced fruit of your own choosing. Fruit added to cereals by manufacturers is often high in sodium and sugar, and usually there is not a lot of it in the box. Add nutrition to a bowl of hot or cold cereal by sprinkling wheat bran or germ over it. Flour Flour is the powdery substance made from grinding grains.

Wheat is usually used, but flour 286 Part II Encyclopedia of Foods The characteristics of flour depend on the type of material used to make it. Because most flour is used to make bread and other baked goods, most flour is ground from wheat. The high gluten content of wheat works well in leavened bread, leading to a light and airy finished product. Most wheat flour contains a combination of flour from hard and soft wheat. Hard wheats contain more protein and gluten, and soft wheat flours make for a more delicate texture.

    "content": "Flour was traditionally ground by hand or by stone, but today’s flour undergoes an extensive process in which grain seeds are pulverized by steel rollers. More refined flour has the bran and the germ—and thus, the nutrition—removed from the seed. Flour is mostly composed of the seed’s starchy endosperm. However, the germ and bran are returned to the flour at the end of the milling process in whole-grain flours. For other types of flour, nutrients are returned at the end of the process, although not all of them are returned. Check the label to see whether the flour has been enriched. Imagine what it would be like if eating pizza, pasta, most breads, cookies, cakes, candy bars, canned soup, or luncheon meats or drinking a beer left you with cramps, diarrhea, anemia, and even osteoporosis. For many people with celiac disease, that is a reality. Celiac disease, also called celiac sprue, is a hereditary disease that occurs when a protein called gluten found in wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats generates an immune reaction in the small intestine of genetically susceptible people. As a result, tiny hair-like projections in the small intestine, called villi, shrink and sometimes disappear. The villi then are not able to absorb nutrients from food, and the result is abnormally colored, foul-smelling stools and weight loss. This malabsorption also can deprive the brain, nervous system, bones, liver, and other organs of nourishment and cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies that may lead to other medical problems. About 1 in 500 people in the United States has celiac disease—about 500,000 Americans. Some speculate that celiac disease has affected humans since they first switched from a foraging diet of meat and nuts to a cultivated diet that included high-protein grasses such as wheat. Physicians have gained an understanding of the disease and how to treat it in only the past 50 years. Today, people with celiac disease are able to lead nearly normal, healthy lives",

    "content": "Today, people with celiac disease are able to lead nearly normal, healthy lives. A gluten-free diet—a lifelong and complete avoidance of wheat, rye, barley, and oats and any foods that contain them— is the only way to treat this disease. Following such a diet is not as easy as it seems because many processed foods and medications contain gluten. Once gluten is removed from the diet, the digestive tract begins healing within several days. Significant healing and regrowth of the villi may take several months in young people and as long as 2 to 3 years in older persons. Foods allowed in a gluten-free diet include fresh meats, fish, poultry, milk and unprocessed cheeses, dried beans, plain fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, and gluten-free grains such as corn and rice. Identifying gluten-free foods can be difficult. People with celiac disease should discuss their food selections with their physician and a registered dietitian. A dietitian also can advise how best to improve the nutritional quality of a diet. Food manufacturers can be contacted to find out whether a product contains gluten. Celiac disease support groups and Internet sites also may have information on the ingredients found in food products. CELIAC DISEASE the label to see whether the flour has been bleached. Manufacturers often bleach it to whiten it. One result is that the flour may have more gluten. Unbleached flours, how- ever, may have more flavor. Bread flour—A specialty flour used for bread making, this flour has a higher gluten content. Cake flour—Made exclusively of soft wheat, this very refined flour gives cakes a light, soft texture. Because it is so refined, it has a low gluten content and cannot be used to make raised breads. Pastry flour is a less refined version of cake flour. Durum flour—Made from hard wheat, durum flour is often used in pasta because it is high in gluten. Gluten flour—This flour undergoes a manufacturing process so that its gluten has about twice the strength of regular flour",

It should not be used in yeast breads. In addition, leavening agents in this flour can lose strength with age. Whole-wheat or whole-grain flour— This is flour that has the wheat germ and bran (or the bran and germ from the grain being used) that were removed during milling added back before it is packaged for consumers. Sometimes this is called graham flour. This type of flour is higher in nutrients. Preparation Tips Proper storage of flour is essential because flour can spoil—sometimes quickly under the right conditions. The result is an objec- tionable odor and inferior baked products. How to store flour depends on the type being used. It is best to store whole-grain flours in airtight containers in the freezer. Grains 287 only semolina, which does not absorb as much water and is pleasantly firm when cooked al dente (slightly firm). Pasta also may include other ingredi- ents. Some doughs have a little egg added. Other ingredients may include soybean and mung bean flour, vegetables (spinach, toma- toes, beets, carrots), gluten, whey, herbs, spices, and flavorings. Color can be pro- vided by vegetable purées or food coloring. Pasta comes in literally hundreds of shapes, sizes, thicknesses, and colors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, groups it all into two main categories: Macaroni—This includes just about every pasta shape and size. The FDA requires that macaroni be made from durum wheat flour or semolina. Ingredients such as salt, eggs, and flavorings also may be added. Noodles—Noodles are generally made with softer durum wheat flours than semolina and contain egg. In addition, the amount of egg they can contain is limited to 5 1/2 percent of weight or less. The shape and choice of the pasta you choose depend on what you like and how it will be served. A general rule is that thinner pastas are best in soups and stews",

    "content": "A general rule is that thinner pastas are best in soups and stews. Whole-grain flours will stay fresh for up to a year this way. Whole-grain flours include the germ of the grain, which contains polyunsaturated fat. This fat is susceptible to oxidation and rancidity the longer it is exposed to air. Refined flours have only the starchy endosperm of the grain. Such flours can be stored at room temperature up to a year or in the freezer for up to 2 years. Airtight con- tainers will keep refined flours tasting fresh. Because flour can spoil, it may be wise to purchase flours in small quantities so you use them up more quickly. Serving Suggestions Flour is the basis for most baked goods. Although wheat flour is typically used, other types of flour can be used to boost flavor and nutrition. Flour also typically is used as a thickening agent in soups, stews, and creams. Pasta The origins of this popular and versatile food are lost in the mists of history; several countries (China, Japan, and Italy, just to name a few) claim credit for pasta. Nearly every country, however, has some pasta variation to claim as its own. The term “pasta” is used broadly and generically to describe a wide variety of noodles made from dough. The word “pasta” itself is thought to be derived from the Italian word for paste. The main ingredients in pasta dough are flour—which is usually made from durum wheat and is called semolina—and a liquid. The dough is rolled out, cut or pressed into the desired shape, and readied for sale. Pasta is sold fresh, frozen, or dried. Imported dried pasta is considered superi- or to American-made products, mainly because the imported pasta is made with WHAT IS SEMOLINA? Semolina is a yellow, granular flour that is ground from durum wheat. The word is derived from the Latin “simila,” which means fine white flour. Semolina is made from the endosperm of the durum wheat seed. It has a high protein content. Although it can be used in a variety of baked goods, semolina mainly is used to make pasta",

The color and crispness of dried pasta determine quality. White pasta should be slightly golden and translucent, not grayish or cloudy. Spaghetti should have the springiness of fresh twigs. A good-quality flat noodle will fracture in a jagged line when broken and not look starchy. Check fresh pasta for expiration dates. Dried pasta should be stored airtight in a cool, dry place and can be kept almost indefinitely. Fresh pasta should have a pleasant aroma. It is highly perishable and will keep for several days in the refrigerator and for up to a month in the freezer. Cooked pasta will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Preparation Tips Pasta is cooked by adding it to boiling water. If desired, add a pinch of salt for flavor and a small amount of oil to the water. The oil will help prevent the pasta from becoming sticky. Then, cook the pasta until it is done. Doneness is mostly a matter of taste—how firm or soft do you like it? Many cooks use the term “al dente” in reference to pasta doneness. Al dente simply means cooking the pasta until it is firm to the bite. Cooking time varies, however, depend- ing on whether the pasta is fresh or dried. It also depends on whether the pasta is made from soft or hard flour. Generally, pasta made from hard wheat flour is cooked longer than pasta made from soft wheat flour. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta.

In Japan, wheat noodles are classified by size: thin noodles are called somen, and thick noodles are called udon. Other types of noodles are the following: Buckwheat noodles—Called soba by the Japanese, these noodles can be pur- chased fresh or dried. Mung bean noodles—These noodles are transparent and sometimes referred to as cellophane noodles. They are added to various dishes, including many soups. Rice noodles—Made from rice flour and water, rice noodles vary widely in size and texture. Preparation Tips Noodles should be soft and look fresh. Your best bet for fresh noodles is to buy them from an Asian specialty food store. Cooking methods vary, as do cooking times. Most noodles, however, are cooked initially by adding them to boiling water. Some noodles may need to be soaked before cooking. Follow package instructions. Serving Suggestions Although fried Asian noodles are added to various dishes, healthier alternatives include serving chilled buckwheat noodles with low-sodium soy sauce or adding various Asian noodles to soups and stews. Asian noodles can also be added to stir-fry dishes or mixed in salads with cooked vegetables and strips of cooked chicken or beef. If desired, rinse pasta with cold water after removing it from heat. Some pastas used in baked dishes—such as lasagna, manicotti, and cannelloni—do not require precooking, but they usually require a greater amount of sauce, which is absorbed by the pasta as it cooks. Pasta that is cooked for a long time loses slightly more of its water-soluble B vitamins than pasta cooked al dente. Serving Suggestions Pasta itself is low in calories and fat, but sauces that are heavy and fatty, as well as other additions, can negate pasta’s nutritional advantages. Fortunately, healthy options abound. Supermarkets offer a wide variety of reduced-fat pasta sauces or those that are vegetable- and herb-based.

Asian Noodles Noodles have been part of Asian cuisine for centuries and continue to play a central role in many well-loved dishes. They are served in ways most Westerners are familiar with: either chilled or hot, covered with a sauce or dressing, or added to soups or stews. 291 Nutritionists have long recognized that Americans generally eat too many animal- based proteins. That’s one of the reasons the “meat group” makes up just a small segment of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid. It’s also why the Food Guide Pyramid no longer refers to proteins as “meat” alone. Although most people associate protein with only meat, there are many other ways to add this critical nutrient to the diet. This chapter covers the traditional animal sources of protein in the diet. It also introduces you to alternative plant-based sources and provides tips on incorporating a variety of these foods into a healthful diet. Because of the wide variety of high-pro- tein foods, this chapter has been organized into the following sections to make it easier to learn about them: C ompared with other populations, Americans have always found plentiful sources of proteins from both animal and plant sources. Ever since the 1800s, fueled by a growing American cattle industry and refrigerated railroad cars, meat has been viewed as the key component to a meal",

Protein is an important nutrient in the diet. That’s undisputed. The trouble is that most Americans consume too much of it, particularly animal-based proteins, which are high in saturated fat and cholesterol, both of which are linked to cardiovascular disease. Most people need just 5 to 6 ounces a day of high-protein foods. That may sound like a lot, but it isn’t. A 2- to 3-ounce serving of meat is about the size of a deck of cards. Now think of the giant portions of meat and other high-protein foods often served at restaurants. Eating two to three times as much protein as you need in a day can easily be accomplished in just one restaurant meal. • Poultry • Shellfish • Eggs • Legumes • Meat • Nuts and Seeds • Fish Poultry When nomadic hunters and gatherers first became farmers, they realized the impor- tance of raising birds. The egg could be eaten, the feathers were used for bedding and clothing, and the flesh made a fine roast. It also was economical to keep poultry; cattle needed miles of grazing land, but a chicken could peck around a yard and keep itself fed. Until mass production tech- niques, poultry meat was fairly expensive; new technology has made poultry more affordable through breeding and produc- tion techniques. Today, poultry is defined as any domes- tic bird used as food. There are many domesticated varieties of poultry, includ- ing chicken, turkey, duck, goose, Rock Cornish hen, guinea fowl, and pheasant. Generally, all types of birds are sold fresh, frozen, or cooked. They can be purchased whole, halved, or in pieces, such as boneless breasts, strips, or medallions",

In addition, disinfect any surface or utensil that came in contact with the raw bird. Thorough cooking destroys any disease- causing organisms (pathogens) in meat. Use a meat thermometer and cook poultry until the internal temperature reaches 180° Fahrenheit. The center of the chicken should be white with no sign of pink. The following pages provide an overview of the main types of poultry: chicken, duck, game birds, goose, and turkey. Chicken Thanks in large part to chicken’s low price, low fat, and high versatility, the amount of chicken consumed in the United States has increased exponentially. That wasn’t always the case. Even though chicken is one of the oldest living species of animal, it was a rarity on the dinner table. King Henri IV of France stated in his coronation speech that he hoped each peasant in his realm would have “a chicken in his pot every Sunday.” At one time, only the rich (and chicken farmers) could manage the proverbial Sunday chicken. Today, thanks to modern pro- duction methods, almost anyone can afford chicken. In fact, adjusted for inflation, chicken is only a third the price it was 40 years ago. Chicken consumption also has increased because of increasing awareness of the need to reduce fat in the diet. Chicken, as long as the skin is not eaten, is generally lower in fat than most other types of meat. At least half of the fat in a chick- en is in the skin",

The government grades chicken quality with USDA classifications A, B, and C, which are based on meatiness, appearance, and how intact the skin and bones are. Storage Always keep poultry refrigerated at 40° Fahrenheit. Poultry can be stored in its original wrapping. If freezing, over-wrap with airtight foil or freezer bags to prevent freezer burn. Frozen poultry can be stored for up to 12 months if it is purchased whole and 6 to 9 months if it is purchased as poultry parts. Frozen poultry should always be defrosted in the refrigerator and cooked in less than 24 hours after thawing. Refrigerated poultry should be cooked within 2 to 3 days. Safety Issues Poultry is a particular concern when it comes to food-borne disease. The gas- trointestinal systems of poultry frequently harbor harmful microorganisms. Mass slaughtering processes offer ample oppor- tunity for these organisms to contaminate the meat. Outbreaks of Salmonella, a bac- terium that causes vomiting and diarrhea, are often associated with eating contami- nated poultry. Another microorganism found on chicken is Campylobacter, a bac- terium that can cause severe diar- rhea and stomach cramping. At the store, avoid cross- contamination by putting poultry in plastic bags to prevent leakage onto other foods. At home, prevent raw poultry from coming into con- tact with other foods by using separate cutting boards and utensils during meal preparation. Always quickly disinfect any surface or utensil that has come in contact with any raw poultry. In addi- tion, wash hands with hot water and soap, lathering for 20 seconds Nutrition All poultry, which is defined as any domes- tic bird used as food, is a nutritional star. Classified as a complete protein, poultry meat is a good source of phosphorus and zinc and an excellent source of niacin. The fat content of poultry depends on the bird.

However, poultry generally contains less fat than meat from other animals. To elim- inate significant fat, do not eat the skin. Cooking the meat with or without the skin makes little difference in fat content. The meat will be more moist if the skin is left on during cooking. Selection When buying fresh poultry, look for meat that is supple and moist and has no dry or discolored patches. Another important criterion is odor. Avoid birds that have an objectionable smell. Do not buy frozen poultry that is dried out or is covered with frost. A sure sign that a bird has been frozen, thawed, and refrozen is the presence of pinkish ice on the carcass. Grade A chickens, the highest grade, are usu- ally found in markets. Grade B chickens are less meaty, and grade C birds are scrawnier yet. B- and C-graded chickens often are used for processed and packaged foods. The grade stamp can be found within a shield on the package wrapping, or sometimes on a tag attached to the bird's wing. Many ungraded chickens find their way to stores because grading is not mandatory. Chickens called “broilers” are butchered at about 7 weeks of age, when they weigh between 2 and 4 pounds. The term “fryer” is often given to larger birds from this age range. “Roasting chickens” generally weigh more than 4 pounds and are slaughtered when they reach 10 weeks. “Stewing chickens” — also known as hens or boil- ing fowl — range in age from 10 to 18 months. They can weigh between 3 and 6 pounds. Generally, they are used for stews and soups because their meat is tougher. Shoppers may also encounter other terms to describe chicken. A Rock Cornish hen (or game hen) is a chicken hybrid that weighs about 2 pounds when butchered. Because there is relatively little meat on the carcass, each hen is typically considered 1 serving.

Depending on the man- ufacturer, the chicken may or may not have been fed a vegetarian diet free of hormones, growth enhancers, and antibiotics. Some believe that this special treatment results in a fuller-flavored chicken. One thing certain is that it adds to the expense. Most free- range chickens are far more expensive per pound than regular chicken. A tip for shoppers: larger chickens are a better buy because there is more flesh on the bones. With smaller chickens, you do not get as much meat and you pay for bones. High-Protein Foods 293 Serving Suggestions Chicken is extremely versatile. Because of its popularity, entire cookbooks have been written focusing on only this bird. It seems almost every ethnicity has its own way to use chicken — Indian curry chicken, Chinese stir-fry, Mexican chicken enchi- ladas, Spanish paella, and Italian chicken parmesan. Chicken’s flavor is enhanced by almost any herb, spice, or condiment. Frying is also a popular way to serve chicken. However, this cooking method adds extra fat and calories, detracting from the health benefits of eating chicken. If eating at a fast-food restaurant, choose grilled chicken instead of chicken that has been breaded and deep-fried. Preparation Tips Keep chicken refrigerated until you are ready to use it, or freeze it and then thaw it in the refrigerator. Cut away any excess fat, but keep the skin on while cooking to provide flavor, then remove the skin for a healthier entrée. Chicken lends itself to a variety of cooking preparations, including baking, broiling, boiling, roasting, frying, braising, barbecuing, stir-frying, and stewing. Boneless chicken requires less cooking time. However, this type of chicken will taste more bland because the bones and the skin add that real “chickeny” flavor",

Roasted chicken Duck Duck, or duckling, includes any of the 80 different species of wild or domestic birds with webbed feet. Today, several major breeds of duck are raised for their meat. These domesticated ducks may be three times larger than their wilderness-reared relatives. Duck is very popular in Europe and China, where more duck is eaten each year than chicken. In the United States, how- ever, duck is usually perceived as a special holiday dish, if eaten at all, because Americans annually eat less than a pound of duck per person. In contrast, Americans eat close to 50 pounds of chicken per year. The consumption level may be lower because Americans consider ducks to be fatty and scrawny. The perception of ducks as fatty rings true, because ducks are one weigh between 3 and 7 1/2 pounds. Older ducks are generally larger. Almost all ducks sold in stores are frozen so that they are available year-round. Preparation Tips Fresh duck should have a broad, fairly plump breast; the skin should be elastic, not saggy. For frozen birds, the packaging should be tight and unbroken. Frozen duck should be thawed in the refrigerator, a process that takes from 24 to 36 hours, depending on the size of the bird. Duck should not be refrozen once it has been thawed. Before cooking, all visible fat should be removed. Also, prick the skin with a fork to help the fat melt and drip away from the bird during roasting. Some cooks also remove the skin and underlying fat. Cook whole birds to 180° Fahrenheit, breasts to 170° Fahrenheit, and legs, thighs, and wings to 180° Fahrenheit. Serving Suggestions Duck can be prepared in a variety of ways, including roasting, braising, and broiling. Ducklings are best roasted in the oven on a rack so that as much fat as possible can drip away from the bird",

Game Birds Game birds is a broad category that includes any wild bird hunted and eaten as food. These birds include the following: 294 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods of the highest-fat types of poultry. The fat (mainly found within and beneath the skin) helps keep the duck buoyant. Duck is also rich in protein. It is an excellent source of riboflavin, niacin, and phosphorus and is a good source of iron, zinc, and thiamin. Duck’s reputation as scrawny may be unde- served, however. They do have a large skeleton and thus a relatively high propor- tion of bone. But specialty breeds, such as Muscovy ducks, have increased breast size for more meat. The USDA grades duck quality with classifications A, B, and C, similar to other poultry. The majority of ducks are really duck- lings, 6 to 8 weeks old. Broilers and fryers are less than 8 weeks old. Roasters are birds that are slaughtered when they are no more than 16 weeks old.

Each serving is about 3 to 4 ounces. During the holidays, it may be possible to find fresh goose in stores. At other times of the year, it is usually sold after it has been frozen. Because geese have so much fat, they are best roasted. Piercing the skin while roasting will allow fat to escape, reducing the fat content of the bird that is eaten.

A salad featuring sliced oranges and onions complements the flavor of the goose and the sweet potatoes nicely. kraut. Small birds may be stuffed with a few green olives and garlic. Goose Geese, those graceful, large birds with their long necks, large beaks, and signature cry, have long been a favorite tar- get for hunters. One reason is that the birds, which often weigh about 25 pounds, provide a lot of meat. In addition, their flesh is tender and flavor- ful. Goose has long been a traditional hol- iday dish and remains a popular dinner in England and northern and central Europe. Geese have not achieved the same pop- ularity in the United States. This may actu- ally be an advantage because geese are one of the fattiest types of poultry. Up to half the calories in a serving of goose are derived from fat. There are about 13 grams of fat in a skinless 3 1/2-ounce serving and up to 22 grams for a serving with the skin on. Geese are often advertised at holidays in the United States, but they are typically avail- able frozen all year. Popular products made from goose include smoked goose breast, goose liver pâté, and goose liver sausage. Preparation Tips A goose should be plump and have a good fatty layer, skin that is clean and unblem- ished, and pinkish or light-red flesh. A frozen bird’s packaging should be tight and unbroken. The goose should be thawed in the refrigerator, a process that can take up to 2 days, depending on the size of the bird. The goose should not be refrozen once it has been thawed, a general rule with all frozen products",

However, these birds are usually leaner than mass-market birds and even leaner than farm-raised “wild” game. If you are fortu- nate to have a hunter in the family, you may have good access to game birds. For most people, however, finding game birds will be difficult, although specialty stores may be of help. Sometimes, game birds are sold frozen, and smaller birds may be sold canned. Preparation Tips When buying game birds, avoid those with an “off” odor. If you are preparing birds you have hunted yourself, check with a local hunt- ing organization or gaming officer, because preparation tips differ from region to region according to weather conditions. Because wild birds can be the leanest of any poultry, they may benefit from marinating. They usually are also basted during roasting. Older birds are best cooked with slow, moist heat such as braising or used in soups or stews. Do not overcook game birds. Test for doneness by plunging a fork into the fleshi- est part of the thigh and by using a meat thermometer. For light-fleshed birds, the juices should run clear. For dark-fleshed birds, the juices should be light pink. Serving Suggestions Game birds can be used in place of tradi- tional poultry in many dishes.

    "content": "In fact, 90 percent of all turkeys were sold during November and December. It all started when wild turkey was served as part of a feast of thanksgiv- ing in 1621, and the tradition of turkey on the Thanksgiving table endures. Americans now embrace the turkey for more than just special-occasion dining. Today, turkey is sold in supermarkets in parts, just like chicken, for ease of use. Breeders also have created smaller versions of turkey. Served whole, these new birds can weigh in at 5 to 8 pounds instead of the standard sizes, which can be 20 or so pounds at holiday time. Turkey is very similar to chicken in many regards, both nutritionally and with respect to USDA grading and storage requirements. The meat is high in protein, niacin, and vitamin B6. It also provides a good source of phosphorus and zinc. Like chicken, turkey is a low-fat poultry choice, containing about 5 grams of fat per serv- ing after roasting and removing the skin. Turkeys are available in supermarkets year-round. The skin on fresh turkey should be off-white to cream-colored and the meat should be pink. Self-basting turkeys have butter or vegetable oil injected under their skin to increase their flavor and moistness, cutting down on the possibility of an overly dry dinner. Turkeys also are available smoked — as whole or breast only — or canned. Preparation Tips If you are buying a frozen turkey, make sure it is rock-hard and free of any cuts or tears in the protective wrapping. Then, defrost it using the same methods and precautions as recommended for chicken. If you are buying a fresh turkey or fresh turkey parts, rinse the flesh with cold water and pat it with paper towels before cooking. For thawing, which is always done in the refrigerator, allow about 1 day for every 5 pounds of turkey. Check to make sure you have removed the giblets, heart, or other organs, which may be packaged in the breast cavity. Keep and cook the giblets separate from the turkey",

Serving Suggestions Although turkey is traditionally stuffed and roasted, it can be cooked in several ways. Parts such as breasts, legs, and cutlets can be prepared in the same way as a favorite chicken recipe. Cooked and smoked turkey also goes well in cold salads and sandwiches. If you are preparing the traditional turkey meal, estimate 3 hours for an unstuffed turkey of 8 to 12 pounds and 4 1/2 hours for an unstuffed turkey of 18 to 24 pounds. Use a food thermometer. Turkey breasts should be cooked to 170° Fahrenheit, and drumsticks, thighs, and wings to 180° Fahrenheit. To ensure uniform cooking and safety, cook stuffing outside the bird. If it is cooked inside the turkey, the center of the stuffing must reach 165° Fahrenheit. Eggs In addition to being a popular breakfast food, eggs are a symbol of beginnings. Primitive humans recognized the egg as the beginning of life, and it became a symbol of spring and fertility. Eggs have four main parts: Shell — As the name suggests, this is the fragile and porous outer covering. The shell is made mostly of minerals — calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and calcium phosphate. Shell membranes — These are layers of protein fibers that stick to the shell. They provide additional protection for the egg’s insides, preventing mold and bacteria from getting in, for example. Albumen — This is the white of the egg. It is almost all protein and water. Yolk — The yellow bull’s eye of the egg, the yolk is made of a substance called “vitellus.” It can be a pale yellow or dark yellow. About 30 percent of the yolk is fat, and about 16 percent is protein. The remainder is made up of solids. There is no nutritional difference between brown and white eggs.

They can be refrigerated unopened for up to 12 weeks from the pack date. They can be used like eggs already scrambled. Pasteurized eggs in their shells are also now available. Egg substitutes are a blend of egg whites and other ingredients such as food starch, corn oil, skim-milk powder, tofu, artificial coloring, and various additives. Because they are almost all protein, egg substitutes can become rubbery if overcooked. High-Protein Foods 297 Eggs provide an inexpensive source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and min- erals, including vitamins A and B12, folic acid, and phosphorus. They are an excel- lent source of riboflavin. The egg is also said to be a complete protein, because it contains a complete count of essential amino acids. The white supplies more than half the protein in an egg. The yolk sup- plies the fat, along with the remaining protein, and most of the calories. Eggs are also graded and are classified by both size and quality. The best are grade AA or A, both of which are related to the level of freshness and the quality of the shell at marking. Most recipes are based on large eggs. Nutritionally, there’s no difference between brown eggs and white eggs. Different colored eggs come from different varieties of hens. The most common egg used for food today is the chicken’s egg, although eggs from other fowl can be bought in specialty stores. Preparation Tips When selecting eggs, check the container for any cracked or broken eggs and elimi- nate them from the carton. Place the carton in the refrigerator for up to 5 weeks. Do not place eggs in the designated egg holders in the door of older refrigerators. It is too warm for the eggs there because they get a blast of hot air each time the door is opened. The egg carton helps keep eggs from absorbing odors from other foods and helps keep the eggs fresh",

Serving Suggestions Eggs serve many purposes in cooking and preparing food, including a leavening agent in baked goods, a base for mayonnaise, and a thickener in sauces and custards. Served alone, eggs can be poached, boiled (soft or hard), fried, scrambled, or made into an omelet. From a safety stand- point, it is recommended that both the yolk and the white be cooked until firm. Because they are made mostly of water and protein, eggs are best cooked over low heat. Meat Meat is the general term for any muscle from any animal. However, most people think of meat as meaning “red meat.” This section describes red meats, including the common American staples of beef, pork, lamb, and veal. Also included are ostrich, rabbit, buffalo, and game meats. Rabbit, buffalo, and game meats were once com- mon to the American menu but are now eaten much less often. The same is true of so-called variety meats — brain, heart, kidney, liver, tripe, and tongue. Whereas Americans once needed to make use of every part of a slaughtered animal, the abundance of food, along with changing tastes and attitudes, has made variety meats only rare additions to meals. Meat is composed of three basic mate- rials: water, protein, and fat. On average, lean muscle tissue is about 75 percent water, 18 percent protein, and 3 percent fat. The eventual texture and taste of the cooked meat depend on the amount of fat and water in the tissue and on the kinds of 298 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods proteins. In general, the most tender cuts of meat have more fat and less fibrous muscle. Tougher tissue from older animals often has more flavor. Both limitations can be overcome by using the proper cooking methods",

    "content": "Both limitations can be overcome by using the proper cooking methods. Roughly 50 percent of the protein in meat comes from fibers that contract the muscle and 30 percent from oxygen-storing pigments called myoglobin and various enzymes. The remaining 20 percent comes from connective tissues that hold the muscles together. Nutrition From a nutritional point of view, because the composition of most animals is similar to that of humans, animal tissues supply us with complete proteins. More simply, the protein from animals is similar to that produced in our own bodies. Thus, it contains the full count of essential amino acids. (See Chapter 2, Dietary Protein and Body Protein, page 24.) Red meat is an important source of min- erals, including iron, phosphorus, zinc, and copper, and vitamins, including B vitamins and vitamin A (see the Appendix: Dietary Reference Intakes, page 454). However, there are some nutritional trade-offs to be made. Red meat can be the main source of fat — particularly saturated fat — and cholesterol in the American diet. Both have been linked by numerous studies to cardio- vascular disease. Too much fat and choles- terol can contribute to the buildup of plaque in arteries, which in turn increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. In addition, diets high in fat have been linked to some types of cancer, particularly colon cancer. Americans have traditionally enjoyed an abundance of meat in their diets compared with other populations, and tastes in meat continue to evolve. As more people have become aware of the risks of eating too much red meat, consumption of beef has declined. Recently, it has started to increase again and remains top on the consumption list. An important reason is that as health concerns have grown, both the meat industry and grocers have responded by introducing leaner cuts of meat and lower-fat options, such as lean hamburger. Poultry consumption has grown significantly since the 1970s. Selection Many factors influence how tender and tasty meat will be after cooking",

These factors include: • The type of muscle (or cut) • The amount of fat and connective tissue in the meat • The age of the cut • The manner of preparation Cuts from more exercised muscles (leg, hip, and shoulder) are tougher than those from the center of the animal — the rib, loin, or breast.

Aging is a process that relaxes the tissues, making the beef easier to chew and enjoy. The original process of aging, now called dry-aging, demanded that a carcass hang in a cooler for 3 weeks or more. The surface would dry out and be thrown away. The remaining beef made excellent but expen- sive steaks. This process is now reserved for steaks bound for only the best steakhouses. Less fatty cuts are preferred from a nutri- tional standpoint. However, they are less tender than those with fat marbled through the muscle fibers. “Choice” and “select” grades have less fat and marbling and can be tougher than the “prime” grade unless they are prepared to maximize tenderness.

Good meat-handling prac- tices include thawing meat in the refrigera- tor, making sure juices from raw meat do not get on other food, and disinfecting cook- ing and preparation surfaces after handling raw meat. For more information about cooking meat and other protein foods prop- erly, see Chapter 5, Cooking It Safe, page 149, and Food Safety, page 148. The following pages contain more specific information on different types of meat and how to include them in a healthful diet. Beef Beef comes from the adult bovine, includ- ing cows (females that have had a calf), steers (males castrated when very young), heifers (females that have not been bred), and bulls younger than 2 years. Beef from Storage Meat is perishable, but there are ways to maximize its shelf life. To do so, minimize its exposure to light, oxygen, enzymes, and microorganisms. All of these can hasten the breakdown of muscle tissue and the decay process. Keep meat securely wrapped — preferably with opaque butcher’s paper, available at gro- cery stores — and refrigerated at less than 40° Fahrenheit in a dark place. Bacteria and molds thrive in higher temperatures and humidity. Refrigerating meat inhibits the growth of these microorganisms, and freezing meat at 0° Fahrenheit or below actually halts their growth. Meat wrapped in butcher’s paper can be stored in the freezer for up to 12 months. Safety Issues Any kind of meat can harbor harmful microorganisms that can cause food-borne QUICK TIP Freezer burn (the discoloration and change in flavor that meat can acquire after it has been frozen) can be minimized by wrapping meat as tightly as possible with waterproof packaging. According to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, overwrap the supermarket wrapping with heavy-duty foil, plastic wrap, a plastic bag, or freezer paper to ensure that air is kept out",

    "content": "IRRADIATED HAMBURGER Consumers in a growing number of states can now purchase irradiated hamburger at the supermarket. So what does “irradiated” mean, and should you buy the meat? Irradiation is simply the name given to a process that uses radiation or electricity to kill disease-causing organisms (pathogens) in food. Food is passed briefly through either type of energy. It does not become radioactive. Instead, the energy kills most of the pathogens in food. The food still looks and tastes the same. By law, food that is irradiated must have a label that clearly states it has undergone this process. The symbol is called the radura. (See Chapter 4, What About Irradiated Foods? page 91.) Irradiation has been used for decades to kill pathogens in spices and other foods and also to sterilize medical materials. In February 1999, the U.S. government cleared the way for irradiated red meat to be made available in stores. Because red meat, and beef in particular, can harbor several pathogens, including the potentially deadly E. coli bacterium, scientists and experts in food-borne disease have long advocated irradiation as an important step in making this food group safer. Irradiation has its critics, who say that the method needs to be researched more. However, it is endorsed by nearly every major medical organization in the world, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Medical Association. an animal slaughtered after age 2 years is generally classified as “well-matured beef.” Meat from these animals begins to toughen and becomes more of a purplish red. Baby beef, in contrast, is from a 7- to 10-month- old calf. Of all the animals domesticated for food, cattle reign supreme. This animal, once only a beast of burden, became a source of meat and milk only after feed from improved agricultural practices became plentiful",

The result is that beef is 27 percent leaner than it was 20 years ago. When eaten in moderation and pre- pared with low-fat cooking methods, beef remains a nutritious addition to meals. Preparation Tips When shopping, pick a cut of beef whose tenderness and level of flavor appropriately fit the recipe you are using. In general, the more expensive the cut of meat (rib, loin, breast, filet, sirloin), the greater the flavor and tenderness. Cheaper cuts (leg, hip, shoulder) may be less tender but are just as flavorful. They are best prepared with slow, moist-heat cooking, such as boiling, poach- ing, stewing, steaming, or braising. Any of these moist-cooking methods are also best for any leaner, tougher cut of beef (leg, hip, shoulder), and slow cooking provides the best results. Using a tenderizer also makes tough cuts more palatable. Acid ingredients such as vinegar, yogurt, cider wine, citrus juice, and tomatoes often are used in marinades because they tenderize the meat. Natural enzymes such as papaya, figs, and pineapple also can be used for the same purpose. Cover meat with the marinade and place it in a non-metallic container in the refrig- erator for 6 to 24 hours. Aged beef that you might find at your local supermarket probably has undergone wet-aging. The carcass is vacuum-packed in plastic bags and then placed in coolers for a week to a month. This process ten- derizes the beef, but it does not have the dramatic improvement in flavor that occurs with dry-aging. Ground beef contains enough fat (about 15 to 20 percent) to give it flavor and make it juicy without excess shrinkage",

For years, Americans have been one of the world’s top consumers of beef. But in response to concerns about red meat’s link to cardiovascular disease and cancer, consumption has declined significantly. Since 1978, beef consumption has dropped 28 percent, whereas poultry and pork con- sumption has grown rapidly. Beef producers have launched several programs to provide leaner beef products. The industry has developed leaner beef breeds, let the animals forage from grasslands instead of grain lots, and developed economic incentives for pro- ducing leaner cattle. Retailers also have reduced the average thickness of fat around the edge of steaks and roasts from 3/4 inch to 1/10 inch, and some- times no external fat is present at all. In addi- tion, low-fat ground beef and other meats All meat sold in the United States must be inspected for wholesomeness by the government, usually by the USDA nationwide team of meat inspectors. Many people are familiar with this agency’s stamp of inspection, which is placed on the outside of the carcass. The USDA also grades meat, although this is a voluntary process. Grading meat essentially means using categories to give consumers an estimation of quality. Beef cuts are judged by the palatability characteristics of the meat. Inspectors look at the marbling (flecks of fat in the meat that give it flavor) and the firmness. The USDA grades for beef, from best quality to lowest quality, are as follows: • Prime • Choice • Select • Standard • Commercial • Utility • Cutter • Canner The cuts given the highest grade also have the most marbling. To help make leaner, more healthful cuts appealing to consumers, the USDA came up with the term “select” for good quality cuts of meat that were lower in fat. Previously, the agency had used the term “good.” Most consumers will not find the five lowest-quality grades of beef in stores",

The leanest (around 11 percent fat) and most expensive of the ground meats are ground round and ground sirloin. New processing of ground meat is now making available even leaner choices (around 5 percent fat). The leaner choices are ideal for calorie and fat watchers, but they have to be cooked carefully to avoid their becoming too dry. For more flavorful cuts of meat, dry- heat cooking — roasting, baking, broiling, or grilling — is more common. Try these methods with steaks, tenderloins, and filets. To reduce the fat content of beef sauces or soups, refrigerate them and gently spoon off the fat layer that forms on the surface. Serving Suggestions Although beef can be part of a healthful diet, the key is to think of it as a side dish and not the main entrée. Dishes such as sirloin kabobs fulfill the craving for beef without the need to eat a lot of it. Stir-fry- ing, in which thin strips or chunks of beef are combined with large quantities of veg- etables, is also an excellent way to have beef play a supporting role at mealtime. Stews and casseroles with vegetable-based sauces also offer this advantage. Another simple option is to cut down on the amount of ground beef called for in a recipe. Reducing the amount of ground beef by half cuts the calories, fat, and cho- lesterol by half.

Beefalo is what its name suggests: a cross between buffalo and cattle. The result is a dark red meat that is very lean and has a flavor that is slightly stronger than that of beef. Most grocery stores do not carry beefalo. It is available in some specialty markets. Although intro- duced some years ago, beefalo has been slow to gain popularity. At the same time, demand for ranch-raised buffalo is increasing. tion of ranch-raised buffalo is bringing bison meat back to the American table. Buffalo is lower in fat than most cuts of beef and chicken — as well as some fish. It also tastes like lean beef and has no gamey flavor. Because of these characteristics, it is viewed by some food experts as the “gourmet food of the future.” Although many ranch- ers and farmers have begun raising buffalo, so far the demand for it is outstripping supply. Preparation Tips Trim any excess fat before cooking. Because buffalo meat is so lean, it should be cooked slowly at a low heat. Otherwise, the meat will be chewy and flavorless. Serving Suggestions Grill buffalo steaks at least 6 inches from the heat source, basting often. Cuts of buffalo are similar to cuts of beef and can be substituted in most beef recipes, as long as the meat is not cooked past medium- rare. Remember, however, that buffalo cooks more rapidly than beef because it has less marbled fat. Lamb Spanish padres and English pioneers brought the first sheep to the United States",

Have your butcher remove this layer, or do it yourself before you are ready to cook the lamb. Leaving the fat in place will cause the amount of saturated fat to skyrocket, and the lamb will take on a stronger taste that many Americans, unac- customed to lamb, might find displeasing. Lamb fat burns at a much lower tempera- ture than other animal fat, and the lamb is left with a smoky, fatty aftertaste. You also need to remove the fell, a mem- brane that encases the surface fat. The fell is left on some larger cuts to help trap the natural juices. The fell is inedible, and neither heat nor seasonings can penetrate it. The cuts you most often find at your grocery store — leg of lamb, rack of lamb, chops, and loin — can be cooked by roast- ing, broiling, sautéing, or grilling. But if you are planning to serve the lamb rare or medium-rare, which is recommended, rib chops surpass shoulder chops. A quick- read thermometer inserted in the thickest portion of the meat should read 145° Fahrenheit (medium-rare). Chops cut from the shoulder are best slowly braised. The size of a rack of lamb depends on the kind of sheep. An American-raised sheep will have a rack with seven to eight ribs, weighing approximately 2 pounds and feeding three or four people. A rack from a New Zealand sheep may weigh only 1 pound and feed two people",

Serving Suggestions Leg of lamb is a traditional dish at Easter, and lamb and mutton are common ingre- dients in Middle Eastern couscous dishes. Lamb also makes a wonderful meat for kabobs, the best cut being leg meat cut into difficult to buy in the United States. Most lamb available at your local supermarket will be the more tender spring lamb. Lamb is leaner, too, because of selective breeding practices and because the meat is trimmed of more excess fat before packaging. There are five USDA grades for lamb, based on the proportion of lean meat to fat: prime, choice, select, utility, and cull. Most of the lamb sold today is choice. Use color as a guide to purchase lamb. A general rule is that the color gets darker as the animal gets older. For example, baby lamb is pale pink, and regular lamb is pink- ish red. You also can use the weight of a leg of lamb to judge its age. The more a leg weighs, the older the animal was at slaughter. A large leg, nearing 10 pounds, then, will have strong flavor and tougher flesh. Mutton legs are around 12 pounds. to the meat may be because sheep were orig- inally bred for wool first and then con- sumed for meat. The older lamb resulted in a stringy, tough piece of meat. Today, animals are bred for only one purpose, and the meat has a finer consistency and a better flavor. To qualify as a lamb, a sheep must be younger than a year. However, most lambs are sent to market at 6 months or younger. Baby lamb and spring lamb are both milk- fed and slaughtered before they are weaned. Regular lamb is slaughtered before it reaches 12 months of age. Lambs between 12 and 24 months are yearlings. Mutton, the meat of sheep more than 2 years old, has a much stronger flavor and less tender flesh. Mutton has gained a rep- utation among Americans as inedible, but with proper slow-cooking methods, that rep- utation is unwarranted. Even so, mutton is A serving of meat is about 3 ounces — about the size of one lamb chop",

High-Protein Foods 303 Serving Suggestions Rub olive oil on ostrich before grilling, then season with herbs or a touch of salt and pepper. Substitute ostrich in any recipe calling for lean beef or venison. Pork Pork was popular early in American history because pigs offered large litters of offspring and meat that could be preserved by smok- ing and pickling for long winter months. Pigs also would eat anything available. A typical farmer owned four or five hogs. An early governor of Virginia was one of the first to introduce swine to the New World. The state is famous for the quality of hams and other pork products produced there. Although pork generally refers to swine younger than 1 year, most pork today is slaughtered at a younger age (6 to 9 months) to produce meat that is more tender and mild- flavored. The diet of a hog before slaughter has changed. What the colonists once thought was a positive — that a pig would eat anything — caused trichinosis, a food- borne disease that was once acquired almost exclusively from undercooked pork. Today’s hogs are fed a diet of grain, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, and trichinosis is thus rare. 1-inch cubes. Complementary seasonings include garlic, mustard, basil, mint, rose- mary, and sage. Lamb fat solidifies once the meat cools, so the meat should be served on warm plates. Lamb stew meat usually is cut from the shoulder, neck, breast, or leg (this might also be called a lamb shank). Use it in place of beef, pork, or veal in any slow-cooked stew or braised meat recipe. Use ground lamb as you would use ground beef. The less tender cuts of lamb (shoulder, breast, shank) are best marinated. Ostrich With origins in Africa and parts of south- west Asia, the ostrich is a huge, flightless bird that can weigh up to 250 pounds and reach up to 7 feet in height. For centuries its meat and eggs were sought, but now ostrich can be raised like other forms of livestock",

    "content": "Although still more exotic than a rib eye steak, ostrich meat is showing up on more and more restaurant menus, a direct correlation to the hundreds of ostrich ranches now in the United States. Some specialty meat markets may carry, or will special order, ostrich meat. The meat is deep red and looks like very lean beef. Ostrich is low in saturated fat and has very little choles- terol. Because ostrich is a bird, it technically is classified as poultry, but it tastes more like venison and is similar to lean beef in its color and texture. Preparation Tips The best ways to cook ostrich are by sautéing (pan frying or cooking) and quick grilling. Because it is such a lean meat, it easily becomes dry if overcooked. The best cuts of ostrich are the fan fillet, inside strip, tenderloin, and oyster. Until recently, pigs were bred to be hefty and fat, but pork has been gradually trans- formed by concerted breeding efforts to produce leaner meat. In general, today’s hogs provide meat that is lower in calories and higher in protein than just 10 years ago. On average, pork is 31 percent lower in fat and 14 percent lower in calories than it was in 1983. However, not all pork cuts are lean, depending on the part of the pig used. For example, bacon still has 14 grams of fat per ounce (about 4 slices), but extra- lean cured ham may have less than 2 grams of fat per ounce. Pork is an extraordinarily versatile meat. Pork comes to market in two basic forms: fresh and smoked. Only about a third of all pork is sold as fresh pork. The majority is cured, smoked, or processed into items such as bologna and hot dogs. The rump and hind legs of the pig are usually cured and smoked as hams. The same is true of the belly, or what becomes bacon after curing and smoking. Most fresh pork comes from the pork loin and the shoulder, an area of the animal that is also known as “Boston butt.” This is cut into chops, steaks, roasts, cubes, and strips",

The acid from the fruit also helps tenderize the meat. Pork holds up under some strong sauces, such as barbecue sauce. Pork can be sliced into medallions and added to stir- fry dishes or served with steamed vegetables for an elegant entrée. Sweeter foods, such as applesauce or sweet-and-sour sauces, also complement the flavor of fresh pork. Ham Ham comes from the rump and hind leg sections of the hog and is available in either fresh or cured forms. Fresh ham commonly is roasted, but cured ham, which is often ready-to-eat, can be quickly baked, pan- fried, or microwaved. The meat is usually cured in one of three ways: dry salt curing, brine curing, or brine injection curing. For dry curing, the surface of the ham is heavily salted, and then the ham is stored to allow the salt to saturate the meat. In brine curing, the ham is immersed in a sweet, seasoned brine. If sugar is added to the curing mix, the ham may be labeled sugar-cured. Most mass producers of ham use the injection-curing method, in which the brine is injected directly into the ham, shortening the curing process. After curing, a ham may be smoked to add flavor and aging capability. Gourmet hams are heavily smoked for a month or more",

A wide selection of specially cured hams are also imported from many European coun- tries, including German Westphalian ham, which is smoked with juniper berry and beechwood. Other specialty hams include English York ham and French Bayonne. The smoked flavor will vary depend- ing on the type of wood used (usually hick- ory or maple) and the addition of unusual ingredients such as juniper berries and sage. Preparation Tips Fresh pork was once cooked to an internal temperature of 170° to 185° Fahrenheit to avoid trichinosis. But with the new lean- er pork, such a temperature is no longer necessary, nor is it advised. Cooking meat to this temperature will dry out the pork, making it chewy and hard to cut. Some older cookbooks on your shelf still may advise this higher temperature as a guide, but a better internal temperature is 160° to 170° Fahrenheit, which will produce juicy, tender meat. At this temperature, the inside of a fresh pork cut may still be pinkish. This tinge of color is nothing to worry about as long as the internal tem- perature has reached at least 160°. That temperature destroys any organisms that could cause trichinosis. Fresh cuts of pork can be prepared with dry-heat cooking methods of grilling, broil- ing, and roasting, but marinating or basting may be necessary to keep the meat tender. Fresh pork cooked to an internal temperature of 160° Fahrenheit will be juicy, tender — and safe. increase the loin’s length (see sidebar: Pork Cuts: Where They Come From, page 303). Pork is a good source of thiamin, a B vitamin humans need to convert carbohy- drates into energy. It is also a good source of zinc. The following pages provide an overview of the different types of pork. Fresh Pork Some of the more popular fresh pork cuts are pork chops, pork loin, and pork ribs. There are three types of pork ribs. Spareribs are from the breast and rib sections and provide little meat. Back ribs, or baby-back ribs, are cut from the loin, so they have more meat",

Microwaving is another option for reducing the fat in bacon. Put paper towels under and over the bacon to absorb the fat as the bacon is cooked. Serving Suggestions Bacon is too fatty and high in salt for every- day use. On occasions when it is eaten, reduce the amount of bacon strips used in the food. Or, add flavor without using a lot of bacon by using bacon bits. Even better, try imitation bacon bits, which are not made from bacon at all but from a vegetable protein. The result is bacon flavor with- out bacon’s nutritional drawbacks. Rabbit and Hare Rabbit meat is often compared to chicken, but it has a sweeter, milder taste. Rabbit is also a little leaner than chicken. Three ounces of roasted rabbit has 7 grams of fat, whereas the dark meat of a roasted chicken has 8 grams and the white meat 3 grams, skin removed. Rabbit meat for the table can be from either wild or domesticated animals. Farm- bred rabbits are somewhat fatter and blander in flavor than their free-roaming counter- parts. They also have a fine-textured flesh that is almost all white meat, unlike their wilder counterparts. A mature rabbit weighs between 3 and 5 pounds, an amount that will serve four people. More than double the size of its rabbit relative, the hare can weigh as much as 12 to 14 pounds. Hares have longer ears than rabbits, a notched lip, and powerful hind legs. Whether wild or domesticated, hares have a darker flesh and heartier flavor than rabbits. Preparation Tips Fresh and frozen rabbit is available dressed either whole or cut into pieces",

Hams are sold in several forms, includ- ing boneless (with the hip, thigh, and shank bones removed), partially boned (with the hip or shank bones removed), and bone- in. Most producers of gourmet ham leave some bone in to enhance the flavor during cooking. Canned hams may be a whole piece of boneless meat or they may be created from bits and pieces of meat and held together with a gelatin mixture. Preparation Tips A fresh or cured ham should look firm and have a white layer of fat and pink to rose- colored flesh. Country-style hams (dry- cured hams) such as Smithfield hams are coated with salt, so they should be scrubbed with a stiff brush, soaked in cold water for 48 hours, and then scrubbed again. Labels on hams should be checked for cooking and serving instructions, because hams are available fully cooked, partially cooked, or uncooked. Fully cooked hams, sometimes labeled “heat-and-serve”or “ready-to-eat,” do not require additional cooking. Serving Suggestions Keep in mind that the curing process for ham makes it high in sodium. Persons following a low-sodium diet may want to save ham for special occasions and mini- mize how much is eaten. Those whose diets can tolerate a high-sodium food can add lean or extra-lean ham to a wide variety of dishes. Ham goes particularly well with pasta and rice dishes and in combination with vegetables. Ham can be baked, grilled, sautéed, broiled, or simmered. Try adding lean or extra-lean ham to make a hearty salad that serves as the centerpiece of a meal.

Bacon is also high in sodium and contains nitrates and nitrites, which are chemical preserva- tives that have been shown to cause cancer in animals. The amount in bacon is not great, and therefore it is not clear that they are harmful in the amounts normally con- sumed. For all of these reasons, the regular inclusion of bacon at breakfast should be reconsidered. Compared with American bacon, Canadian bacon is more like ham, because it comes from the tender eye of the pork loin. It is more expensive than regular bacon, but it is leaner and precooked (less shrink- age), providing more servings per pound. Sliced bacon comes in thin slices (about 35 strips per pound), regular slices (16 to 20 strips per pound), or thick slices (12 to 16 strips per pound). Canned bacon is popular with campers because it is precooked and needs no refrigeration. Bacon bits are crisp pieces of bacon that are preserved and dried. They should be stored in the refrigerator. (A popular imi- tation made from vegetable protein may be kept at room temperature.) Bacon grease, the fat rendered from cooked bacon, is sometimes used as a cooking fat in regional dishes, as are salt pork (salt-cured cuts from the sides and belly of the pig) and fatback (fat from the pig’s back, that can be salted and made into “cracklings” or unsalted and made into lard). Preparation Tips You can reduce the fat in bacon by broil- ing it on a rack, allowing excess fat to drip light-colored flesh. They are considered the most tender. When cooking aged or wild rabbit, use moist heat to cook it (such as stewing, braising, or marinating) to ten- derize and whiten the meat. Wild hare, also called jackrabbit and snowshoe rabbit, generally needs marinating to tenderize it before cooking. This process also whitens the meat",

If you are interested in preparing veal, your first step should be to locate a super- market or butcher who carries veal on a reg- ular basis. Because Americans tend to eat veal in restaurants, the retail market is much smaller than beef’s beefy share. You may need to order the cut of veal you want and the amount you need in advance. The best cuts are from the rib and the loin of the calf. They are the most tender and the most expensive and can be bought as ribs, chops, or scallops. Veal scallops have many names — scallopini, cutlets, schnitzel. However, all these words describe thinly cut veal slices. The best scallops come from the top round, cut against the muscle fibers. Cutting against the grain ensures the thin scallops will not buckle when they hit the heated pan. If you are buying scallops, look for a smooth surface, which indicates they have been cut properly. Storage of veal is similar to that of beef. Serving Suggestions Veal scallops can be used to make veal scal- lopini. Scallops are dredged in flour and lightly cooked in oil or butter for 1 to 2 minutes. Veal roast can be cooked with either low or high heat, but high heat works better with more expensive cuts of meat. For cuts from the shoulder, breast, or leg, roasting at a lower heat with rubbing of added fat creates a more tender entrée",

The name means “bone with a hole.” The bone is a marrow-filled Veal Credit the American love of Italian and French food to the increase in veal appre- ciation. Dishes such as veal scallopini and grilled veal chops introduced the meat to palates that were much more aware of the heavier, heartier taste of beef. The name veal is derived from the Latin vitellus, which means calf. The meat is garnered from a young calf, usually 1 to 3 months old, that has been fed only milk. Milk-fed veal comes from calves up to 12 weeks old that have not been weaned from their mother’s milk, but veal of this quality is rare in today’s supermarket. Shoppers are more likely to find veal fed a nutritionally balanced milk or soy-based diet that is for- tified with essential nutrients. Color is the most important criterion when choosing a good cut of veal. The flesh should be a creamy white to ivory tone — barely tinged with grayish pink — and the fat should be white and creamy. The pinker the meat, the older the animal was at slaughter, and the meat is tougher and stronger-flavored. If the meat is a reddish tone but still marked as veal, it may be a calf between 6 and 12 months and should more appro- priately be called baby beef. Or, the calf may have been allowed to eat grains or grasses, which also darken the meat. Animals were once confined to limit their movement; hence, the meat would be more tender and pale. For that reason, the consumption of veal was a source of con- troversy. In recent years, veal producers have attempted to make their modes of pro- duction more humane. The USDA can grade veal in five different categories, but it usually does not. If the veal has been categorized, it will carry marks of (from highest quality to lowest) prime, choice, good, standard, and utility. The last three grades are rarely sold in retail outlets.

Goose and duck livers are used mainly to produce the famous pâté de foie gras. Fresh American foie gras must come from ducks, but imported foie gras can come from either goose or duck. These birds are specifically bred with enlarged livers. An important note is that the liver processes most substances that enter the body. This includes any chemicals that an animal might be fed or given as a medica- tion. The older the animal, the more likely it is that there may be accumulations of unwanted residues in this organ.

For a more elegant meal, broil or pan cook cubed liver and serve with mustard and boiled new potatoes. Liver also can be roasted (at 325° Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes per pound) and also served with boiled new potatoes. Soaking the liver in cognac for several hours before cooking adds a rich flavor to roasted liver. Sausage Born of economic necessity, sausage mak- ing has now become an art. When farmers slaughtered their own animals, they wanted to make sure that they used every part of the animal",

Most often, pork is the main ingredient in sausage, but poultry or fish can be used. After countless decades of experimen- tation in ingredients — which include meat, spices, and fillers — sausages are often now considered a delicacy. They can be differ- ent in taste from one to the next. Sausages are fresh (made of raw ground meat and spices), precooked (such as hot dogs or High-Protein Foods 309 Liver pâté However, farm-raised animals may have more fat and be more tender than their wild counterparts. Game animals are categorized as large game and small game. Large game animals include deer, elk, moose, caribou, and ante- lope. Other popular large game animals include wild boar and bear. Other varieties eaten around the world include camel, elephant, kangaroo, zebra, and wild sheep. The most common small game animal is wild rabbit. Squirrel is also popular. Beaver, muskrat, opossum, raccoon, armadillo, and even porcupine are also eaten. Preparation Tips Any game meat found in commercial markets is federally inspected. The skin of a hunted animal should be removed and specific steps for butchering should be followed. The animal also can be taken to a butcher who specializes in game preparation. For maximum tenderness, most game meat should be cooked slowly and not overdone. Cooking can be done with moist heat by braising or with dry heat by roasting. Meat from older animals can be ten- derized in a marinade that contains an acid such as vinegar to break down tough fibers, oil to add succulence, and wine, herbs, and spices to permeate the meat with flavor to reduce the “gamey” taste. Meat should always be marinated in the refrigerator because it takes quite long to mellow the flavor and tenderize (3 to 5 days).

Fresh sausages need to be cooked, often by pan frying. Precooked sausages may need no preparation at all, or they can be grilled, broiled, or poached in hot water. Fresh sausage can be kept for only about 2 days in the refrigerator. Dried or semi- dried will last 2 to 3 weeks. Cooked sausage can be kept for about a week. Serving Suggestions Partially dried and fully cured sausages may be used in sandwiches or cut up for pizza or paella. One thing to keep in mind is that sausages are laden with sodium, calories, and fat. Reduce the amount of fat in the sausage you eat by draining the excess fat during cooking or by selecting the reduced-fat and reduced-sodium varieties of sausages now available in stores. Minimize the amount of sausage you eat by using it as a flavoring in meals instead of a main course. Game Meats Game meat was once classified as wild animals hunted for human consumption. However, because many “wild” animals are now being raised as livestock on farms or hunted in protected environments, the definition has changed slightly to include animals once hunted in the wild for meat. The graying of the term also has made nutritional generalizations difficult. Because the diets and activity levels of domesticated game animals are different from those of their roaming counterparts, their meat has a different flavor and is often described as having a milder, less gamey taste. Meat from wild animals also may be lower in fat than meat from farm-raised animals. Fish Health-conscious Americans are figuring out what much of the world already knows. When prepared well, seafood tastes good, and it is good for you",

The variety and convenience of fish may be causing the increase, because markets across the country — even those in the landlocked states — are stocking live shell- fish and fresh fillets from both coasts. What once seemed intimidating to meat-eating Americans can now be cooked with the same ease as a pork chop or pot roast. Nutrition Seafood is a good source of high-quality protein, usually with a low number of calories. One 3-ounce serving of most fish or shellfish provides an excellent source of protein, at often fewer than 100 to 150 310 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods scallops, crab, and lobster, actually have amounts comparable to those of most fish. Shellfish are also low in fat. Most fish have levels of cholesterol comparable to that of the white meat of poultry and of lean, well- trimmed red meat. Fish also contain important vitamins and minerals, especially some of the B vitamins, iron, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Saltwater fish supply iodine. Canned salmon, sardines, and herring, with their soft bones, which are mostly edible, are also a good source of calcium. In general, fish are low in sodium, sim- ilar to the amount in red meat and poultry. Persons following low-sodium diets should limit their intake of processed salted or dried fish, pickled herring, smoked fish and shellfish, sardines, surimi products, and anchovies. Selection What to look for depends on the type of fish being purchased: Whole, fresh fish — The criteria for buying this type of fish boil down to this: look for the fish that appears to have been pulled from the water most recently. Scales should be shiny and stuck firmly to the skin. The flesh should feel firm and should not pull away easily from the bone. Gills should be moist and red, and the eyes should be shiny and not sunken. As always, the odor is a telltale sign of fish freshness. The fish should have a mild, fresh smell",

Even oil-rich fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, generally have fewer than 225 calories in a 3-ounce portion, comparable to the calories of lean meats. The fat in fish is mainly polyunsatu- rated and monounsaturated rather than sat- urated, as in meat. Furthermore, fish have a unique polyunsaturated fatty acid called omega-3 that is believed to have a beneficial effect in reducing blood clots, lowering blood cholesterol levels, and minimizing heart disease (see Chapter 3, Coronary Artery Disease, page 61). The fish that are particularly good sources of omega-3 fatty acids are sardines, herring, mackerel, Atlantic bluefish, tuna, salmon, pilchard, butterfish, and pompano. Most shellfish were once considered high in cholesterol. However, new research has shown that although shrimp and squid have high levels of cholesterol, other shell- fish, including clams, mussels, oysters, Commercial fishing allows consumers who are land-locked to enjoy fresh fish. Salted and smoked fish — Avoid fish with an “off” odor. Storage Whether the fish you buy is fresh or frozen, make it the last thing you purchase before heading home. If you will be delayed, have the market pack fresh fish on ice. Immediately refrigerate fresh fish in the coldest part of your refrigerator (usually the lowest shelf at the back or in the meat keeper), and use it within a day or two. Freeze your fish quickly to keep cell walls intact, but thaw the fish gradually so that fewer juices leak out of cells",

If you must thaw fish quickly, seal it in a plastic bag and immerse it in cold water, allowing 1 hour to thaw a 1-pound package. You can also microwave frozen fish on the “defrost” setting, stopping when the fish is still icy but pliable. Most fish will keep in the freezer for about 6 months. Never refreeze fish. Canned fish, such as tuna, salmon, and sardines, will keep for about a year or less. However, because you cannot be sure about the conditions in which canned goods have been stored in the warehouse, it is best to buy only what will be used within a few months. Preparation Moist-heat cooking methods (poaching, steaming, or stewing) are best-suited for lean fish such as cod, flounder, or sole. Dry- heat cooking methods such as baking, broil- ing, and grilling are best suited for moderate- to high-fat fish, such as bluefish, butter- fish, catfish, or salmon. En papillote, the French technique of cooking fish enclosed in parchment paper or foil, is an elegant way to keep fish moist.

Bacteria, viruses, and other microor- ganisms can contaminate fish. Without care- ful handling, these can spread to humans through undercooked fish or cross-contami- nation, which occurs when surfaces used to prepare fish are not disinfected. Like all living organisms, fish can occa- sionally carry various parasites. These parasites are easily destroyed by normal cook- ing procedures. In pickled products, such as pickled herring, the acidity of the vinegar used in pickling, often in combination with salt, preserves products and destroys para- sites and harmful bacteria.

The flesh should just barely flake. For large fish, a meat ther- mometer can be used to determine whether the fish is cooked thoroughly. The flesh should reach 145° Fahrenheit to be con- sidered done. Fish continue to cook after they are removed from heat. For that reason, it is often recommended that you stop cooking fish just before it appears to be done. Overcooked fish looks dry, falls apart easily, and does not have many of its natural juices left over. Marinades are an excellent way to add flavor with little fat to fish. Make sure that you marinate the fish in the refrigerator to prevent harmful microorganisms, if pres- ent, from multiplying. Fish steak, fillet, and butterfly fillet 312 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods is a medium-sized fish. It is usually caught at weights between 4 and 9 pounds and measures between 15 and 52 inches. It has a firm, white flesh. Preparation Tips Cod is a versatile fish and is available fresh or canned. It can be cooked in a variety of ways. If you poach it, make sure that it does not boil. Instead, simmer it for 8 minutes in a bouillon or add it to an already boiling liquid and then remove the pan from the heat immediately. Set it aside until the fish is cooked (about 15 minutes). The roe, or eggs, of the cod are eaten fresh, smoked, or salted. The oil extracted from cod livers is an important source of vitamins A and D. Serving Suggestions Garlic and dill are two seasonings that com- plement this light, flaky fish. Another popular dish is cod cakes, which are simply a varia- tion on the widely available recipe for crab cakes. Cod also can be cured in lye to make lutefisk, a Scandinavian delicacy popular in the Midwest for which one acquires a taste.

    "content": "ROUND AND FLAT FISH The term “fish” includes thousands of different species. For preparation purposes, it is necessary to know only that they are generally divided into two main groups: round fish and flat fish. Round fish. As the name suggests, round fish have a plump shape. Their eyes are on either side of their head. Here is the critical part: their backbone runs down the center. Because thick fillets lie on either side, round fish are usually used as fillets or steaks. Examples include salmon, red snapper, and striped bass. Flat fish. This group’s name also gives away its anatomy. This fish swims horizontally and is shaped like a flat, thin disk. Its eyes are on the top of the head. The backbone is located in the center of the fish. Fillets do not come from either side, as they do in round fish, but from the top and bottom. Fillets are typically cut from flat fish, but larger fish may be cut into steaks. Examples of flatfish include flounder, halibut, and sole. ARE THERE HARMFUL CHEMICALS IN FISH? Because of pollution in oceans, lakes, and rivers, fish may contain harmful chemi- cals such as mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This may be a particular problem in areas where there are manufacturing plants that burn fossils fuels or, in the past, have dumped mercury-containing waste into nearby streams and lakes. Fish at the top of the food chain (generally, the bigger types such as shark or sword- fish) may contain higher amounts of mercury or other harmful chemicals because they feed on lesser fish and cumulate these substances in their fat and flesh. Some species such as large tuna (typically sold as fresh steaks or sushi) can also contain higher amounts. Various health agencies have issued advisories on how much fish is safe to eat, particularly for pregnant or nursing women and children. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that if you are pregnant or may become pregnant, you should avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish",

It is particularly important for people in high-risk groups, which include older people, pregnant women, infants, and persons with liver dis- ease, diabetes, immune disorders, or gas- trointestinal conditions. Fish are generally a low-fat source of protein. Not all fish have equal amounts of fat, however. Instead, fish are grouped into three main categories according to their fat content: lean, moderate-fat, and high- fat. The next section introduces you to the types of fish in each group. Lean Fish Lean fish have less than 2 1/2 percent fat. The flesh of these fish is lightly colored and has a mild taste. Commonly available varieties of lean fish include cod, flounder, halibut, and perch. Cod The cod is a popular saltwater fish that comes from the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans. The cod has been one of the most intensely fished species because it is easy to preserve for transport and storage. It is part of the larger Gadidae family that also includes the haddock, the silver hake, the whiting, the black pollock, and the tomcod. “Scrod” is a term used to describe small cod (1 to 2 pounds), haddock, or pollock. Cod Flounder This very common flat fish is found in the waters off nearly every part of the American coastline. Flounder is actually a large family of fish. Sometimes flounder is referred to as sole or turbot, which are members of the flounder family. Preparation Tips Flounder can be purchased whole or filleted and fresh or frozen. Nearly any type of cooking method can be used with success. Serving Suggestions Sautéeing flounder in a skillet with a little sesame oil, ginger, and garlic is a quick and tasty way to cook this versatile fish.

Halibut One of the largest saltwater flat fish, the halibut is found in the cold waters of the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The fish usually weighs between 10 and 155 pounds. However, some halibut hauled in by fishermen have weighed more than 600 pounds. Halibut is usually available in fillets or steaks. When cooked, it has a firm, white flesh and a mild flavor. Preparation Tips Halibut can be grilled, poached, baked, broiled, or sautéed. The Atlantic halibut, which is usually sold as steaks, is a bit more flavorful than the Pacific halibut, which is more often available as fillets. Serving Suggestions Light marinades, particularly those made from red or white wine, enhance halibut’s flavor without adding fat. High-Protein Foods 313 Moderate-Fat Fish Moderate-fat fish contain about 6 percent fat. Their flesh ranges in color from white to beige and their taste from mild to muddy. Common kinds of moderate-fat fish include striped bass, catfish, swordfish, and tuna. Striped Bass The striped bass was once abundant on both the East and West coasts. But it has become less common because of overfish- ing and pollution. Fish farms have become one of the primary suppliers of this type of fish. Preparation Tips Striped bass has a pleasantly sweet flavor. Its sturdy fillets also lend themselves to a variety of cooking methods. It can be baked, broiled, or steamed. Perch Perch is a freshwater fish, although some- times the rockfish, a saltwater fish, is referred to by this name. Common types of perch include the yellow perch and the walleye, which is usually found in lakes, streams, and rivers of the Great Lakes states. Preparation Tips Another versatile fish, perch responds well to most traditional cooking methods. Sautéed, steamed, baked, broiled, or fried, perch’s light, flaky, mild-tasting flesh responds well.

Catfish Long a Southern delicacy, this fish has become popular in all regions of the country. Because of that, it is now often raised on farms instead of being gathered out of only rivers and lakes. Preparation Tips The fish has a tough skin that must be removed. To do this, use a sharp knife and cut the skin just behind the gills. Pull off the skin with the fingers or a tweezers. Catfish can often be bought at stores cleaned and dressed. 314 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods moving through the water at up to 60 miles an hour, it is known for its power and mus- cular, scaleless body. It usually weighs between 200 and 500 pounds and measures between 6 and 10 feet. Preparation Tips Swordfish is a rich-flavored fish with firm, meaty flesh. It is commonly purchased as fresh steaks and fillets, but it also can be found smoked, frozen, or canned. Because the flesh of swordfish is so firm, it can be prepared in almost any manner, including sautéeing, grilling, broiling, baking, and poaching. Serving Suggestions The rich flavor of swordfish stands up to sauces with pronounced flavor, such as tomato-caper or basil-garlic. Swordfish is also a good fish for grilled kabobs, another low-fat, healthful way to serve fish. Tuna The tuna is a migratory fish found in the temperate marine waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. The most common species include the bluefin, the albacore, the bonito, and the yellowfin tuna. The tuna is a powerful fish that is very agile and a fast swimmer",

Higher-Fat Fish Up to 60 percent of calories of higher-fat fish may be derived from fat. On average, though, fish in this group have only about 43 percent of calories from fat. The good news is that much of the fat that these fish contain is omega-3 fatty acids, which many studies suggest play a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and enhanc- ing brain function. Flesh from these fish is darker and firmer and often has a stronger flavor. Common types of higher-fat fish include mackerel, salmon, smelt, and trout. Mackerel This oily fish is related to the tuna and is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acid. High-Protein Foods 315 Tuna — Make sure the edges are opaque and the center slightly translucent with flakes just beginning to separate. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes to finish cooking. Most mackerel caught is canned. It is also salted or smoked. Persons who live near the coasts, how- ever, may be able to purchase it fresh from fish markets. If purchasing it fresh, look for fish that are firm and stiff. Limpness is a key indicator that the fish is not fresh. The fish should be cooked and eaten as soon as pos- sible because it spoils quickly. A bitter taste is a key sign that the fish has begun to spoil. Freezing the fish is not an option because this seems to drain the flavor from this fish. Preparation Tips Remove the bones if filleting the fish. Because of mackerel’s high fat content, try to use methods that do not add fat. Mackerel can be baked, broiled, or poached. Serving Suggestions Traditionally, mackerel is served with goose- berries. Other methods include using a citrus marinade. Mackerel can be used as a substitute for canned tuna in many recipes. It is also available smoked",

There are several species of salmon in the Pacific (chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, chum) and one in the Atlantic. It has even been acclimated to freshwater. A once threat- ened species, it has survived thanks to salmon farms and species management. Salmon are “anadromous,” meaning they migrate from their saltwater habitat to spawn in fresh water. The females of some species can lay up to 13,000 eggs. The larger chinook salmon (also called king salmon) weighs between 30 and 40 pounds and mea- sures between 34 and 36 inches. The small- er freshwater, or landlocked, salmon is short- er, between 8 and 24 inches, and it rarely weighs more than 13 pounds. Salmon is sold in many forms, including fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, dried, and canned. Fresh and frozen salmon can be purchased whole or as steaks, pieces, or fillets. Whole salmon is usually sold cleaned, with the head on or removed. 316 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Preparation Tips Smelt is sold in a variety of ways, includ- ing fresh, frozen, smoked, or dried. Smelt is also commonly sold without the head or innards. Some people eat the bones, but it is easy to remove bones from this fish — either before eating it or while you are doing so, as you would a sardine. The whole fish can be consumed, however. Serving Suggestions A common method of cooking is to coat smelt with breading and then fry it in a skillet until cooked (about 2 to 3 minutes). Smelt also can be grilled. Trout The trout is also part of the salmon family. It is found mainly in the cold, fresh waters of lakes and rivers, but it also can make its home in saltwater. Like the salmon, trout that live in the sea (the steelhead trout) return to freshwater to spawn. A favorite of sports anglers, the trout was the first fish to be raised in captivity to forestall its extinction",

Smelt A relative of the salmon, this small, thin fish can be both a freshwater and a salt- water fish. Some species are found in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and others inhabit freshwater sources. The main types of smelt are American smelt, European smelt, and capelin. All three types grow to about 7 to 8 inches long. Smoked salmon is usually sealed in plastic or frozen. Salmon’s moist flesh is flaky and tender, and the flavor varies by species from delicate and mild to rich and distinctive. Salmon spoils quickly because the flesh is fatty. The chinook is the fattiest salmon, and the pink and chum are leaner. Preparation Tips The bones often included in canned salmon are edible and serve as a good source of cal- cium. Make sure to crush the bones well. To remove the small bones (called pin bones) from fresh fillets or steaks, use a tweezers or pry them out of the flesh from the side",

Serving Suggestions Although it is often served fried, trout also can be poached, baked, steamed, grilled, and broiled. Whole trout is sometimes stuffed before being cooked. Any season- ings should be kept mild so as not to mask trout’s delicate flavor. Shellfish The shellfish family is divided into two basic categories: crustaceans and mollusks. Crustaceans have elongated bodies and jointed shells. These include crab, lobster, and shrimp. Mollusks are divided into three groups: Gastropods (or univalves) — These have a single shell and single muscle. An example is the abalone. Bivalves — Like the clam and oyster, bivalves have two shells hinged together by a strong muscle. Cephalopods — Examples include the octopus and the squid, which have tentacles and ink sacs. Nutrition Like fish, shellfish are rich in protein yet low in fat and calories. Compared with other types of meat, however, the amount of cholesterol in most shellfish is about equivalent to that of a lean piece of beef or a chicken breast with the skin removed. Shrimp, squid, and crayfish, however, are very high in cholesterol. They have about twice as much as lean beef, making them something to savor on occasion. Selection When selecting shellfish, remember that fresh is best. The best way to guarantee freshness is to buy live. If your geographic location limits your opportunities for live High-Protein Foods 317 Storage Once you leave the market, it is important to keep shellfish cool and refrigerate it as soon as possible. At home, shellfish should be rinsed under cool, running water, placed in a container, and covered with wet paper towels. Use shellfish the day of purchase, if possible, or the next day. Do not seal live oysters, clams, or mussels in a plastic bag. They need to breathe, so store them covered with wet paper towels",

Just as in picking out fish, use your nose to select shellfish. Shucked oysters and clams should be plump and free of any sour aroma. Fresh scallops should have a slightly sweet aroma and, when packaged, be practically free of liquid. Fresh shrimp are firm and have a mild, faintly sweet smell. Crab or lobster should move and not have any noticeable odor. Next, view the shellfish’s appearance. The liquid packed with oysters should be clear, not pink or opaque. Scallops, lobster, and shrimp flesh should be free of any black spots. When you buy frozen shrimp, crab, or lobster tail, make sure any exposed meat is white, not yellow, and not dried out. FISH AND SHELLFISH ALLERGIES Seafood is a common source of food allergies. About 250,000 Americans experience allergic reactions to fish and shellfish each year. People with seafood allergies can have symptoms that range from mild to life- threatening. Even tiny amounts of fish substances can trigger a reaction in some people. What’s more, these allergies are rarely outgrown. Examples of shellfish that are common causes of allergic reactions include shrimp, crab, lobster, oyster, clam, scallop, mussel, and squid. Fish that can trigger allergic reactions include cod, salmon, trout, herring, sardine, bass, tuna, and orange roughy. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include nasal congestion, hives, itching, swelling, wheezing or shortness of breath, nausea, upset stomach, cramps, heart- burn, gas or diarrhea, light-headedness, or fainting.

If you are found to have a fish or shellfish allergy, the best advice is to avoid fish or shellfish altogether. That may be harder than it sounds. You may not be aware that seafood is an ingredient in a dish that you are eating. Be sure to check the labels of any product you buy. In addition, make sure that persons close to you are aware of the potential for this kind of allergic reaction. Many people with a food allergy wear medical alert bracelets. Cherrystone clams. American Indians called them “quahog.” Safety Issues Persons who eat shellfish raw should beware. Raw shellfish may contain the organisms that cause hepatitis and other diseases. Cooking will kill any microorganisms in shellfish. In addition, because shellfish filter large amounts of water each day, they may contain residual amounts of any pollutants in the water near them. Concerns about potentially harmful chemicals are also a concern about shellfish. Women who are pregnant or thinking about having a child should check with their physician about how much shellfish they should eat. Another important safety note is that shellfish are a common trigger of allergic reactions in some people (see sidebar: Fish and Shellfish Allergies, page 317). Abalone Abalone is actually a large snail that lives in the sea. It has a single shell and a tough, muscular “foot” with which it clings tena- ciously to rocks as it grazes on seaweed. The edible portion is this foot. Abalone is found primarily along the coastlines of California, Mexico, and Japan. Four of California’s seven species constitute most of the commercial catch. From largest to smallest are red, pink, green, and black abalone, with red reaching a legal market size at 7 3/4 inches and black at 5 3/4 inches. Black abalone is the most affordable wild species today",

It is an excel- lent source of protein and a good source of iron, magnesium, and phosphorus. Abalone is known by many names: “ormer” in the English Channel, “awabi” in Japan, “muttonfish” in Australia, and “paua” in New Zealand. Its iridescent shell is a source of mother-of-pearl. 318 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods The quahog (pronounced CO-hog) is a hard-shell species from the East Coast and is the largest of Eastern clams (1 1/2 to 6 inches across). Quahog is also a family name for hard-shell clams that can include cherrystones (less than 3 inches) and lit- tlenecks (2 to 2 1/2 inches). Also popular in the East are soft-shell clams called steam- ers. As the name indicates, they are great for steaming. On the West Coast, soft- shell Pacific geoducks (pronounced GOO- ey-ducks) weigh between 2 and 4 pounds, although they can be 3 feet long and up to 5 pounds. They have an enormous siphon that extends from the shell; this is often sliced for sushi because it is also quite sweet. As with all filter feeders, clams some- times ingest toxic levels of planktonic microorganisms during a condition called Preparation Like all fresh shellfish, abalone should be alive when purchased — it will move when it is touched — and smell sweet, not fishy. Choose those that are relatively small for best flavor. Refrigerate abalone immedi- ately and cook within a day. Abalone is also sold canned (once opened, refrigerate, covered with water in a sealed container, for up to 5 days), dried (store tightly wrapped in a cool, dry place indefinitely), and frozen (store for up to 3 months). Widely used in Chinese and Japanese cooking, abalone must be washed first to remove sand that may be caught in the flesh. Abalone must be pounded before cooking to make it tender, because the edible portion is a muscle. Use a mallet to flatten the meat to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness",

Before growing a new shell, these crabs (usually a variety called blue crabs) have a 6-hour window during which they have a soft shell. This window can be extended if the crus- taceans are removed from water. The benefit of a soft-shell crab is that it can be eaten whole without bothering with a pesky, rigid exterior.

Cooked whole crabs and crabmeat should have a fresh, sweet smell. Cooked crab is available in whole pieces (lump white meat from the body) or in smaller pieces (flaked light and dark meat from the body and legs). For ease of use, consider using canned crabmeat. Or, if you prefer, choose pas- teurized crabmeat, which has been heated in cans but has not been subjected to the higher temperatures of the canning process. For this reason, pasteurized crabmeat should be stored unopened in the refrigerator no longer than 6 months. Use it quickly after opening. Always use your fingers to pick over crabmeat, fresh or canned, to make sure there are not tiny pieces of hidden shell. Refrigerate leftover cooked crabmeat, tight- ly covered, for not more than 2 days. Serving Suggestions Crabmeat has a tender, flaky texture and a delicate, sweet flavor. For the best possible flavor, choose live crabs. If only cooked crab is available, add it to hot dishes during the last minutes of cooking and cook just until hot. Crabs can be cooked in a variety of low- fat ways, including steaming and broiling or in broth-based soups and gumbos.

Another common preparation method is boiling. A general rule for cook- ing lobster with any method is to allow 12 minutes per pound. The lobster is done as soon as its shell becomes red or the meat turns opaque. A sign that a lobster has been over- cooked is that its meat is stringy and tough. Serving Suggestions The firm flesh and pleasant flavor of lobster make it a versatile seafood. It can be eaten plain, seasoned with lemon juice, garlic, and a drizzle of butter, or added to pâtés, salads, or sauces. Lobster bisque, essentially a cream- based lobster stew, is a classic lobster dish enjoyed by diners the world over. Because it is high in calories and fat, it should be savored on special occasions. Lobster meat also can be mixed with curry sauce. It is also an elegant, tasteful addition when added to salad greens and sprinkled with lemon juice or a spicy lower-fat vinaigrette. Mussels Perhaps it is the dark shell that accounts for its foreboding reputation. Perhaps it is the name, which makes it sound too much like a stringy, tough muscle. Whatever the case, mussels do not have the audience in the United States that other forms of seafood do, even though people throughout the world have been eating them for more than 20,000 years. Although there are dozens of mussel species, only two reach American markets with any regularity. The blue mussel (which is actually dark blue to black) and the blue- green mussel can be used in recipes inter- changeably, but the blue-green type from New Zealand is larger and more expensive.

Its liver (tomalley) and eggs (coral) also can be eaten. Lobsters are prized by diners for their firm flesh and flavorful, yet not over- powering, taste. Lobsters can be divided into two groups: large, clawed (American) lobsters and spiny (rock) lobsters. American lob- sters hail from around Maine, whereas rock lobsters can be caught in the waters off the southeastern United States and in the Pacific. American lobsters boast claws with yet more meat, but only the tails of spiny lobsters are eaten. These tails are often sold frozen throughout the United States. The meat is more dense and fibrous than that of the American lobster. It lacks some of that characteristic sweetness, but the tails are far more inexpensive than buying a whole American lobster. Lobster is an excellent source of zinc. Preparation Tips When selecting a live lobster, look for an active one whose tail curls under its body when lifted. If lobsters have been stored on ice, they may be sluggish. Bacteria form quickly in a dead lobster, so it is important that you purchase it live. Live lobsters will die quickly, so they must be kept in sea- water, wrapped in a wet cloth, or wrapped in several sheets of wet newspapers. Use these methods for only a few hours (24 hours at most), then cook the lobster. It is best to cook lobster the same day you buy it. Whole, cooked lobsters should have their tails curled tightly under their bodies, a sign they were alive when cooked. Cooked lobster meat should be sweet-smelling and snow- white. Frozen tails should be in an untorn package with no sign of frost; the visible meat should be free of dry-looking spots. High-Protein Foods 321 along the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts.

Many mussels are being cultivated instead of harvested because of the dangers posed by microscopic organisms (of red tide notoriety) that make mussels unsafe to eat during the spring and summer months. When choosing mussels, make sure they are still alive by tapping on their shells. If they slam shut, they are still alive. Those with tightly closed shells also are a good choice. In general, smaller mussels are more tender. Cultivated mussels are usually smaller, and they also lack some of the sand and grit of harvested mussels. Choose shucked mussels that are plump and have a clear liquor (liquid). Or, opt for plain and smoked mussels packed in oil. Store live mussels in a single layer on a tray in the refrigerator covered only with a damp towel or wet newspapers for up to 2 days. Store shucked mussels in the refrig- erator up to 3 days. They should be covered completely with their liquor (liquid). If you need more liquor, combine 1 cup water with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pour this brine over the mussels to cover. Preparation Tips Before cooking, use a stiff brush to scrub mussels under cold, running water. Pull out the dark threads (beard) that protrude from the shell. Mussels die when debeard- ed, the term given for removal of these threads, so do not remove the dark threads until just before cooking. Get rid of sand by soaking mussels in cold, salted water (use 1/3 cup salt per gallon of water) for 1 hour. Like all shellfish, mussels should be cooked gently to prevent toughening. Mussels cooked in their shells are done when their shells pop open. Discard any with unopened shells.

Oysters Oysters have many different names, which are clues to where they come from and their varied taste and appearance. The marine plants they feed on account for these differ- ences. The hard, rough, gray shell contains meat that can vary in color from creamy beige to pale gray, in flavor from salty to bland, and in texture from tender to firm. Oysters are rich in zinc, iron, copper, and vitamin B12. Interestingly, it is oysters’ relatively high zinc content that gave them their reputation as an aphrodisiac when eaten raw. Purchase the freshest oysters you can find. Gauge freshness by tapping on the oyster shells with your fingernail. If they snap shut quickly or are already shut tightly, they are fresh. In general, smaller oysters will be more tender than larger ones. Buy shucked oysters of uniform size and color encased in a clear liquor (liquid). You may store oysters for up to 3 days in the refrigerator using the same method as for mussels, but the sooner you use them, the better. If any shells open during stor- age, tap them. If they do not close, throw them out. Store shucked oysters, covered by their liquor, for up to 2 days in the refrig- erator and up to 3 months in the freezer.

Preparation Tips Scrub live oysters under cold, running water before opening. Oyster knives specially designed for removing the flesh from the shells — which can be a tricky operation — are available at cooking supply stores. Oysters and other bivalves will open more easily if they are heated briefly — such as by steam- ing them for several seconds or microwav- ing them for a minute.

Oysters Rockefeller, a hot hors d’oeuvre that is baked and broiled with a spinach topping, is a traditional, elegant favorite. Use shucked oysters in dressings or poultry stuffings. Oyster stew is often made with only heavy cream, oysters, and butter, but a healthier alternative can be created with evaporated milk and added vegetables, such as potatoes, pearl onions, carrots, or mushrooms. Scallops Like clams and oysters, scallops are bivalves (two-shelled mollusks). Scallops propel them- selves along the ocean floor by clapping their shells together using a well-developed muscle called the eye, the part of the scallopthat is eaten. If you avoid fish and other types of shellfish, you may still like scallops because its eye is firmer than most shellfish meat and its flavor is mild yet sweet. Scallops are rich in vitamin B12 and potassium. Scallops are classified in two broad groups: bay scallops and sea scallops. Bay scallops, with meat about 1/2 inch in diam- eter, are sweeter, more succulent, and more expensive. Sea scallops, with meat about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, are more widely available. A third type is the calico scallop, a small sea scallop from Florida, but it is often sold as bay scallops. These scallops have to be steamed to be opened, so they are partially cooked when sold. They are the cheapest of the scallops. Because scallops cannot close their shells tightly, they spoil quickly out of water, and they are usually shucked at sea. The muscle is iced and the rest discarded. Sometimes the coral-colored roe is left attached to be eaten with the muscle as a delicacy. Look for scallops with a sweet smell and a fresh, moist sheen.

Shrimp Shrimp is the most widely consumed seafood worldwide, and it is the second most popular in the United States, after tuna. The harvest of both wild and farmed shrimp is increasing rapidly to keep pace with the soaring demand for this crustacean. It has become popular internationally because its sweet, mild, and yet distinct flavor is similar to that of lobster, but it is easier to cook and costs half as much. Although hundreds of species are caught, shrimp generally can be classified by origin — either warm water or cold water. Cold-water varieties — such as the well-known small, pink, peeled shrimp — tend to be sweeter than the larger shrimp, which typically develop in warmer waters. These larger varieties are often sold uncooked and unpeeled under the name “prawns,” but the name can be used for shrimp of any size. The names of shrimp can be confus- ing",

    "content": "The names of shrimp can be confus- ing. Many varieties of shrimp are named after a color (white, pink, brown), but white shrimp are not necessarily white. They may look pink, brown, or gray. Confounding the problem, most shrimp shells change color when cooked. Shrimp are marketed according to size (number per pound), but market terms vary greatly. Because shrimp freeze well, most, even those classified as “fresh” in the super- market, have been frozen at some point. Neither taste nor texture suffers much. Shrimp is sold shelled or unshelled, raw or cooked, and fresh or frozen. Shrimp also can be bought breaded or stuffed or as a cold or even frozen. Shrimp are also usually deveined, although this is not necessary before eating small to medium-sized shrimp. To devein a shrimp, cut into the shrimp lengthwise with a sharp knife. Then use the knife to remove the dark vein — which is actually the intestine that runs down its back. Although there are slight differences in texture and flavor, shrimp of various sizes (except the miniatures) can usually be sub- stituted for each other. As with all shellfish, shrimp should be cooked briefly or it becomes tough and rubbery. Cook only until the flesh turns opaque. To test, cut a shrimp in half, and check whether the flesh has turned from translucent to opaque. Whole shrimp should just begin to curl. If the shells are on, they should turn pink. spread for crackers or bread. Dried shrimp and shrimp paste can be found in Asian grocery stores. Preparation Tips Choose raw, shelled shrimp that are firm, moist, and translucent. Avoid any shrimp that smells like ammonia. Unshelled shrimp should have shiny, firm shells. Avoid those with black spots and those with yellow or gritty shells, which result from a bleaching process to remove the spots. Before storing fresh, uncooked shrimp, rinse them well under cold, running water and drain thoroughly. Refrigerate, tightly covered, for up to 2 days",

Soaking shortens cooking time by 30 minutes to up to an hour. It also has the advantage of reducing flatulence (intestinal gas) by making them more digestible. Legumes that are sold as “quick-cook- ing” have been presoaked and redried before packaging and thus do not need to be soaked. When several types of legumes are required for a dish, it is best to cook each type separately because it is difficult to cook them uniformly together. Nutrition Legumes are great sources of nutrition because they carry the embryonic necessi- ties for starting a new plant. They are high in protein, folic acid, potassium, iron, mag- nesium, and phytochemicals (see the Appendix: Phytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484). Legumes are not complete proteins like meats (soybeans are an exception), but they can be paired with complementary foods, such as grains, to ensure a meal provides a complete source of amino acids for building proteins. And unlike meat, they are low in fat, high in fiber, and inexpensive. Because of their low cost, legumes were once considered “poor man’s meat.” But with the increased popularity of ethnic cuisines (such as Mexican, Chinese, and Mediterranean), the growing popularity of vegetarianism, and the recognized health benefits of legumes, they have shed this outdated perception. Selection There are expensive “designer beans,” but most legumes are widely available at grocery stores and are an inexpensive addition to meals. Look for a uniform appearance to the product you are buying. Legumes should also have a deep, almost glossy color",

    "content": "Legumes should also have a deep, almost glossy color. Avoid Most legumes are annual plants that can grow as vines or bushes. The shape, size, and color of the stems, leaves, and flowers differ according to species. After fertilization of the flowers, pods develop. These contain seeds of varying sizes, shapes, and colors. The plants of the legume family share two main features. First, they produce sin- gle-chambered, flattened seedpods with seeds inside. Either the pod or the seeds inside (or both) are eaten. A second common feature is that legumes are capable of an important bio- logical process called nitrogen fixation, which actually enriches or naturally fertil- izes the soil in which the plants grow. Accordingly, legumes (such as soybeans and alfalfa) are grown in rotation with other crops (such as corn) that only take nutri- ents from the soil. Legumes are sold in many forms. They are available as whole fresh pods, such as green beans, and in dried pods, such as the tamarind. Lima beans are examples of legumes available as fresh seeds, and dried seeds include black-eyed peas. There are also seed sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts and soybean sprouts. Although technically con- sidered legumes, tamarind and jicama are treated as a fruit and vegetable, respectively. Legumes are generally easy to prepare and can be either the main entrée or the side dish. Generally, dried legumes are rehy- drated before cooking, which is done by soaking them in water for about 6 to 8 hours. An alternative and shorter method is to put them in a pressure cooker or to simmer them in a pan Serving Suggestions One reason for the popularity of shrimp is its versatility. Name a cooking technique, and you probably will be able to find a shrimp recipe for it. Shrimp is served cold in shrimp cocktail. It can be grilled, boiled, broiled, roasted, curried, or stir-fried. It goes well with pasta and rice. It is also an excellent ingredient in soups and can be used interchangeably with other shellfish in recipes",

Legumes Legumes have historically been part of meals throughout the world. There is abundant evidence that the peanut and lima bean have been used for centuries in South America. Soybeans and mung beans, among others, have been a key part of Asian dishes throughout history. The Middle East is the origin of broad beans, chickpeas, and lentils. Because of this, cooking with legumes can provide an education and an introduction to international cuisine. High-Protein Foods 325 buying products that are cracked, broken, dry-looking, or faded. These are most likely to have been on the shelf for a while. Storage Dried legumes are easily stored. Putting them in a covered container or closed plastic bag can help maintain their freshness and extend their shelf life. Legumes that are commonly used are described on the following pages. Alfalfa Also known as lucerne, alfalfa is the common name of a legume that once was thought of only as animal feed. The plant is believed to have originated in southwestern Asia around the area of Asia Minor and the Caucasus Mountains. Spanish explorers brought the plant to the Americas, where, in the United States, it was first established as a crop in California in the 1850s. Alfalfa grows up to 5 feet in height and bears spiral-shaped pods containing six to eight small brown or yellow seeds. Because the roots are capable of extending as much as 30 feet into the soil, the alfalfa plant can reach stores of water and nutrients that allow it to survive periods of extreme drought. Alfalfa became part of the human diet on a wide scale in the 1970s, when many people began to enjoy alfalfa sprouts. Today, alfalfa sprouts are sold in most grocery stores. Preparation Tips Alfalfa sprouts should be washed thoroughly before they are eaten. Buy sprouts that look healthy and green. Avoid those that are off-color, smell moldy, or look soggy",

This process loosens the skin, which can then be easily removed. Buying beans that are split and dried will help the beans cook faster and eliminate the need to get rid of the tough outer skin. Serving Suggestions Usually used raw, alfalfa sprouts can be added to salads, sandwiches, omelets, tacos, and hors d’oeuvres. They also can be used to garnish soups and stews. In parts of China and Russia, the plant’s tender, young leaves are eaten as a vegetable. Broad Beans (Fava Beans) Commonly called fava beans in the United States, broad beans are also known as haba, English, Windsor, tick, cold, horse, or field beans. Broad beans get their name from the seeds, which are large and flat and look like very large lima beans. The seeds range in length from about a half inch to 2 inches. They can also vary in color from white, green, buff, brown, and purple to black. Broad beans are an excellent source of nutrition. They are rich in fiber, folic acid, potassium, magnesium, and thiamin, to name just a few nutrients. Preparation Tips Broad beans are commonly available dried or precooked in cans, although they can sometimes be found fresh in the pod. The beans have a very tough skin that can be Sprouting at home IS IT SAFE TO EAT RAW SPROUTS? All plant sprouts that are eaten raw may pose a health risk. The reason, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is that they could be contaminated with food- borne pathogens such as the Salmonella bacterium or another harmful bacterium, Escherichia (E.) coli. Pregnant women, children, the elderly, and persons with compromised immune systems (such as people with cancer) may be harmed by ingesting sprouts",

In Italy, broad beans are combined with other strong-flavored ingredients, and in France they are considered a good cocktail food. A simple but elegant serving suggestion is to add a little butter to the cooked beans and a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste and then serve topped with chopped parsley. Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans) Botanical and archeological evidence reveals that chickpea plants were first domesticat- ed in the Middle East in ancient times. Today, however, India supplies 80 to 90 percent of the world’s supply of chickpeas. The many names that chickpeas go by are a nod to the many regions of the world where they are now grown and eaten. In India, they are referred to as Bengal gram. In Spanish-speaking countries, they are gar- banzo. The Arab world refers to them as hamaz (or hummus), and in Ethiopia they are called shimbra. The plants grow in tropical to temperate regions and reach about 2 feet in height. Plants bear inflated inch-long pods enclos- ing one or two irregularly shaped seeds. Middle East, they are mashed and used as the main ingredient in hummus, a thick sauce made with lemon juice, olive oil, and sesame seed paste. Hummus is becoming a popular dish in the United States. Falafel, a Middle Eastern croquette, is another dish that draws on the chickpea as its main ingredient. In the Mediterranean region, chickpeas are added to Spanish stews and Italian minestrone soups.

Common beans originated in Central America, where archaeological remains of these beans, found in association with the remains of maize and squash, have been carbon dated to more than 7,000 years of existence. Columbus and subsequent Spanish and Portuguese explorers carried beans back to Europe and eventually intro- duced them throughout Asia and Africa. A few of the most familiar beans are described here. Black Beans Many people have become acquainted with black beans after eating at Mexican restau- rants, where they are served boiled or refried. Also known as turtle beans, black beans are a common part of the cuisine throughout Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the southern United States. As their name indicates, they have a completely black skin. They have a mild, somewhat sweet taste. Black beans are an excellent source of folate and a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and thiamin. The seeds are about one-quarter to one-half an inch in diameter and can be buff-col- ored, yellow, brown, black, or green. The plant’s young, green pods and sprouts can also be eaten. Like many legumes, chickpeas are an excellent source of fiber. In addition, they are a good source of magnesium. Preparation Tips Chickpeas are available at most grocery stores both canned and dried. They can be eaten fresh, fried, roasted, or boiled. Generally, chickpeas should be soaked overnight before cooking, which is usually done by boiling them. Dried chickpeas may take as long as 2 hours before they are soft and ready to eat. A pressure cooker is also an option and can reduce cooking time by half. Serving Suggestions Chickpeas have a mild, slightly nutty flavor and a firm texture. They can be used in appe- tizers, salads, soups, or main dishes. Flour made from ground chickpeas can be made into breads or used as batter for deep-fat fry- ing. They also can be combined with pasta or simply served by themselves",

Serving Suggestions Black beans are a delicious dish all by them- selves, served with a dollop of low-fat sour cream and bits of diced avocado or guacamole. They are also often stewed, accompanied by rice. They are the key ingredient in frijoles, refritos, or refried beans (but go easy on the fat), and they are the star of black bean soup. Cranberry Beans Cranberry beans are about a half-inch long and are brownish with pink splotches that disappear when cooked. Cranberry beans have a nutty flavor. Their creamy, red- streaked flesh has a smooth texture. Nutritionally speaking, cranberry beans are an excellent source of folate and a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and copper. Preparation Tips Presoak beans.

To reduce the flatulence effect, try these strategies: • The flatulence-producing effect of beans can be further reduced by changing the water several times during soaking and during cooking and by simmering the beans slowly until they are tender. • If a recipe calls for salt, lemon juice, vinegar, or tomatoes, these ingredients should be added near the end of cooking because acidic ingredients stop the process by which legumes absorb liquid and soften. • Use commercially available products that can be added to dishes before serving. These products contain an enzyme that breaks down the complex sugars before they start causing problems. bean: the red kidney bean, which has a deep-red color and a full flavor. Another type of kidney bean is the flag- eolet; its seeds are small, thin, and pale-green. Mainly available dried, canned, or frozen in the United States, flageolets are more pop- ular in Europe. The cannellini bean is another type of kidney bean. It is large and white and has a more delicate flavor than the red kidney bean. Kidney beans are an excellent source of folic acid and a good source of iron, mag- nesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper, and thiamin. Preparation Tips Kidney beans commonly are canned. If you choose to use fresh beans instead of canned, prepare red kidney beans by pre- soaking and then simmering them in water, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Flageolets and cannellini beans can be cooked with the same method for 25 to 30 minutes. Serving Suggestions Consider red kidney beans an all-purpose bean. They make good additions to chili and can be baked, puréed, or refried. Cannellini beans can be added to salads or soups. Flageolets are often served in a white sauce seasoned with shallots, thyme, bay leaf, and clove.

Navy beans are so-named because they have been a common dish served to sailors in the U.S. Navy since the mid 1800s. Sometimes they are also referred to as “Yankee beans.” Slow cooking with molasses gives “white” navy beans their color. Dolichos Beans Derived from the Greek word dolikhos, meaning long or elongated, the general term “dolichos beans” is used to refer to legumes of the genus Vigna and the lablab bean. Common beans considered dolichos beans include the adzuki bean, the black-eyed pea, the lablab bean, and the mung bean. Adzuki Beans (Azuki Beans) Adzuki beans have been cultivated and enjoyed for many centuries in Asia. The Chinese have attributed mystical power to these beans and believe that they bring good luck. This is one reason they are a part of many foods used at celebrations. The bean has a rich, somewhat sweet flavor. It has a reddish color. The plant that bears adzuki beans has 5-inch-long cylin- drical pods that contain 4 to 12 oblong seeds with flat ends. Adzuki beans are usually sold dried, but they also may be sold as young pods that are eaten like green beans. Adzuki beans are an excellent source of folate and a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and copper. Preparation Tips Presoak dried beans. Simmer in water, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes. Serving Suggestions Adzuki beans have a mild, delicate flavor and grainy texture. Sometimes they are eaten with rice. However, they are often made into a flour or paste, which is used in desserts or candies. Combined with sugar, water, starch, plant gums, and other ingredients, adzuki beans are used as a filling for bread, steamed cakes, and dumplings. In addition, they can be puffed like corn or sprouted. Adzuki beans may be roasted to make a substitute for coffee.

Lima Beans Lima beans were originally cultivated in South America, from where they were brought to Europe, Asia, and Africa by European explorers. In the southern United States, lima beans are called butter beans, and the mottled purple varieties are called calico or speckled butter beans. Lima beans also may be referred to as Madagascar beans. Lima bean plants bear flat, oblong pods about 2 to 4 inches in length that contain two to four smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. There are numerous varieties of lima beans, and their seeds vary in size and color. The commonly sold seeds are pale green, but purple, red, brown, black, and mottled ones are also available. The two most common varieties are the Fordhook and the baby lima, which is smaller and milder. how they are used and because of their nut- like shells. The “shells,” however, are actu- ally the fibrous seed pods of a legume, encasing one to three seeds wrapped in an edible, papery thin seed coat. These seed pods are easy to crack and range from less than an inch to about 2 inches long and have the same contours as the round seeds underneath. Peanut plants are separated into either bunch or runner types. The bunch type bears seed pods close to the base of the plant, whereas the runner type has seed pods scattered along the branches. Runner types were introduced in the 1970s and are now more popular than bunch types, prob- ably because runner peanuts are primarily used to make peanut butter, for which half of all peanuts are produced. Spanish peanuts — a bunch-type peanut with small, round seeds covered by a reddish brown skin — are usually roasted, salted, and vacuum-packed. Virginia peanuts, which can be a runner or a bunch plant, are larger and more oval and are usually sold roasted in the shell. Peanuts contain quite a bit of fat, but the fat in them is primarily monounsaturated fat. Peanuts are an excellent source of mag- nesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, niacin, and folate and a good source of iron",

Many foods, though, are made almost entirely from soy (see sidebar: “Soy” Many Products to Choose From, page 333). For cultures in which soy is the main source of protein, rates of cardiovascular disease and some kinds of cancers are rela- tively low. Researchers are also looking into whether soy plays a role in preventing osteo- porosis and easing hot flashes associated with menopause. Some studies suggest there may be a link (see Chapter 2 sidebar: Soy What? page 34). Although it may be too early to make specific health claims for soy, there is evidence that adding soy to your diet makes good nutritional sense. And, you may just discover a whole new range of healthful food products to enjoy. Preparation Tips Generally, the soybeans now being incorpo- rated into food are already processed, such as the soybean oil in margarines and salad dress- ings and the soy protein in baby formula and meat substitutes. Or, they may already be incorporated into food products, such as tofu. Dried soybeans are often available at health food stores. They need to be soaked before cooking to soften them. They are usually simmered, sometimes up to 9 hours, before they are softened enough to eat. Fresh and frozen soybeans are now appearing in markets.

Soy is an inex- pensive way to add protein to your diet and may also help reduce fat when substituted for meat in traditional dishes. Soy products come from the soybean, a legume native to northern China. The United States now produces much of the world’s soybeans. There are more than 1,000 varieties of soybeans. They range in size from a pea to a cherry. Colors include red, yellow, green, brown, and black. The protein in soy is a “complete” protein — the most complete you can get from veg- etable sources — and just as good nutri- tionally as animal protein. In fact, there is more protein in 1 cup of soybeans than in 3 ounces of cooked meat. In addition, soy- Peas Like peanuts, peas may not be immedi- ately recognizable as a legume, because they are marketed and consumed as a vegetable. But appearances are deceiving because, like other legumes, peas are an excellent source of protein. A serving of peas (about 3/4 of a cup) contains as much protein as a tablespoon of peanut butter, but with far less fat. The pea is an annual plant that grows from 1 to 5 feet high. It requires a cool, relatively humid climate. There are more than 1,000 different types of peas. Different plants produce smooth-seeded peas, wrin- kled-seeded peas, field peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Smooth-seeded peas are commonly sold frozen, whereas wrinkled-seeded peas are used for canning because they are sweeter. Field peas are grown mainly for drying. Snow peas and sugar snap peas are grown for their edible crisp, sweet pods. Peas are a good source of iron",

Besides oil that is pressed from soy- beans, soy food products include the following: Miso — Miso is a salty, strong-flavored paste made by fermenting soybean meal and a grain, such as rice or wheat. It is used as a flavor enhancer and thicken- ing agent in many Asian dishes. Colors range from light yellow to dark orange, depending on the type of soybean used to make the miso. Soy flour — Many prepared foods include soy flour, which can be made from whole soybeans or soybean meal. Soy nuts — Roasted soybeans, commonly eaten as a snack. Soy sauce — Another product made from fermented soybeans, soy sauce is an essential condiment and cooking ingredient in Asian cuisine. To make soy sauce, soybeans or soy meal is mixed with ground wheat. Fermentation may take 1 to 3 months. Soybean sprouts — As the name suggests, these are germinated soybeans. They are used in salads and as a garnish. Soybean milk — Soybean milk is made from soybeans that are soaked, ground, heated, and then filtered. Soy milk is a part of many baby formulas for infants who are lactose-intolerant. Soy milk can be drunk as a beverage. Dried soy milk is sometimes added to products such as ice cream. Tempeh — An essential component in Indonesian cooking, tempeh is a meat substitute that is made from soybeans that are soaked, dehulled, cooked, and then fermented.

It generally has a spongy texture. It can be cooked in a variety of ways to make dressings, dips, and shakes. It picks up the flavor of marinades and thus will taste like meat in many dishes. Yuba — A product made of the protein-rich skin that forms on the top of soybean milk when heated just to boiling, yuba has a stringy, chewy texture. It is made of protein and oil and is often used to produce imitation meat products. Common soybean products, such as soy milk, tofu, and fresh soybeans Nuts are a versatile food. They can be eaten fresh, cooked, and, sometimes, with their shell. They are available whole or chopped, salted and unsalted. In addition, products made from them include butters, oils, and spreads. Nutrition The protein in nuts and seeds lacks an essential amino acid called lysine, which can be gained from legumes and animal products. Although nuts are high in calo- ries for their size, they are also considered a “nutrient-dense” food. They contain a lot of nutrients in relation to their calories. Nuts are also rich in different plant com- pounds. Flavonoids, for instance, are found in all nuts. These antioxidants help reduce the formation of free radicals in the body that may contribute to cancer and cardiovascu- lar disease. Relative to their size, nuts are also among the best plant sources for protein. Nuts are generally high in fat. In most cases, more than 75 percent of their calories comes from fat (the exception being chest- nuts — only 8 percent of the calories are from fat). But, on the plus side, it is the “right kind” of fat. Most of the fat in nuts is monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, with the exception of the coconut and palm kernel",

Attached to the end of the cashew apple is the cashew nut, which has a smooth, ash-colored outer shell. The edible kernel of the nut varies between three-quarters of an inch and an inch in length. Its generic name, Anacardium, refers to a heart shape, but cashews have more of a kidney shape. It is impossible to buy cashews in the shell because the edible kernel is covered with an inner shell, and the space between the inner and outer shells is filled with a thick, caustic, toxic oil (related to poison ivy).

The nuts are har- vested by hand once they have fallen from the burr, the name for the spiny outer cov- ering. Trees typically start bearing nuts after about 25 years. Chestnuts can range in size from a half inch to more than an inch, depending on the variety. They have one rounded side and one flat side and one rounded end and one pointed end. The roasted kernel is soft, meaty, and sweet. The common American chestnut, native to the eastern United States, once dominated the forests of Maine to Georgia. But this tree is now nearly extinct because of a tree blight caused by a fungus. Today, only a small number of trees survive. Preparation Tips The most traditional use of chestnuts is to roast them whole, with shell and skin, and to peel and eat them while they are still warm. Before roasting, cut an “x” into the flat side of the nuts to prevent them from exploding. Chestnuts also can be boiled or steamed.

These hybrids include the Winkler, Duchilly, and the Barcelona, which is thought by many hazelnut fanciers to produce the finest nuts. Nutritionally speaking, hazelnuts are an excellent source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and thiamin and a good source of niacin. Monounsaturated fat is the primary source of fat in hazelnuts. Preparation Tips The hazelnut kernel is sweet. It is wrapped in a thin, slightly bitter-tasting, brown skin.

Then, wrap the warm nuts in a tea towel and rub them with the towel after about 5 minutes to remove the skin. Serving Suggestions Hazelnuts can be eaten raw or they can be roasted. Chopped hazelnuts add crunch to salads, soups, sauces, breads, cakes, and cookies. Finely ground nuts can be used as a replacement for flour. Hazelnut paste, made by grinding the nuts to a fine butter and mixing with sugar, is used for bakery fillings and toppings. A fragrant oil made from pressed hazel- nuts adds a nutty flavor to dressings, sauces, pastries, and coffee. Lotus Seed The lotus plant and especially its flowers have been used as a motif in the arts of the ancient cultures of India, China, and Egypt for centuries. Although many peo- ple know it is grown for its ornamental flowers, the lotus plant also has edible roots and seeds. The creamy seeds add a mild flavor to cuisine in many Asian countries.

Mature leaves may be used to wrap rice, meat, and fruit dishes before they are steamed. Lotus seeds are referred to by a variety of names. Common ones include Indian lotus, hasu, and nelumbium. Preparation Tips You can most readily find lotus seeds in Asian supermarkets, where they are sold 338 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods fresh, dried, and canned. Fresh seeds are sold with the seed coat attached or removed, but both types spoil quickly. The seed coats must be removed before the nut can be eaten. Serving Suggestions Lotus seeds can be eaten raw. However, most commonly, they are used in cooking. Or, they are candied and eaten as a snack or added to pastries as a filling. In Asian cook- ing, they may be stewed with poultry, added to stir-fry meals, or cooked in water to make a dessert. Macadamia Nut Native to Australia, the macadamia tree was named for the naturalist Dr. John MacAdam. According to legend, he was the first to find the nuts edible. The macadamia nut is enclosed in a very hard, brownish shell, and the kernel is off-white in color. Each nut is about half an inch to an inch in diameter and is enclosed in a thin, fleshy husk. This husk opens as the nut matures. The slightly Macadamia nuts sweet, creamy, rich flavor of the nutmeat has acquired a “gourmet” reputation and a hefty asking price. Macadamia nuts have the highest fat and calorie content of any nut, but they are an excellent source of magnesium, copper, and thiamin and a good source of iron and niacin. The fat in the macadamia nut is primarily monounsaturated fat. The tree that bears macadamia nuts was introduced to some regions of the United States in the 1880s. It was not until the 1930s, however, that a real consumer audi- ence made the macadamia industry possi- ble. Historically, Hawaii has supplied 90 percent of the world’s macadamia nuts",

Macadamia nuts are also grown in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, Jamaica, South Africa, and Samoa. Preparation Tips Because of their extremely hard shell (which takes up to 300 pounds of pressure to crack) and high oil content, macadamia nuts are usually sold shelled in vacuum-packed con- tainers. The nuts can become rancid quick- ly because of their high oil content. Refrigerating them, however, can extend their shelf life up to 2 months. Serving Suggestions Macadamia nuts may be bought raw or roasted, plain, chocolate-covered, or salted, and whole or chopped. They are great by themselves as a snack. Chopped macadamia nuts add a nice texture and flavor to salads, rice dishes, curries, cookies, cakes, candies, and ice cream. The nuts also can be ground into a creamy butter and used as a spread. Oil made from the nuts can be added to salads or used for cooking. High-Protein Foods 339 Pecan Nut Belonging to the same family as walnuts, pecan trees can be found growing wild from Illinois to Texas and Maryland to Florida. In fact, more than 100 varieties of pecans are cultivated in the United States. Commercial cultivation of pecans, however, is limited to warm states. Georgia produces more than a third of the total U.S. pro- duction, which totals about 200,000 tons of unshelled pecans annually. Pecans are one of the most widely cultivated nuts in the world. The nut itself is elongated and wrinkled, resembling a walnut, and has a buttery flavor. The shell surrounding pecans is shiny, brown, and easily cracked. Most of the fat in pecans is unsaturated. In addition, pecans are an excellent source of many nutrients, includ- ing phosphorus, thiamin, copper, and zinc, and a good source of iron and potassium. More than half of the fat in pecans is monounsaturated fat",

Tightly wrapped, unshelled nuts can be stored in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months; shelled nuts can be kept in an air- tight container in a freezer for up to 2 years. Serving Suggestions Most people know and love pecan pie, a sugary treat popular in the South. Pecans can be eaten raw or roasted as a snack. They add a rich flavor to breads, muffins, cakes, and other baked goods or can be sprinkled on cereal or many other types of food. A candy with Southern roots is pecan praline, made from sugared pecans. Oil pressed from pecans may be used for cooking or for salads, but it is expensive. Pecan nuts Pecan pie Pistachio Nut Pistachio nuts grow in clusters on the pis- tachio tree, which grows wild throughout central and western Asia and is cultivated in warmer areas of the world. The nuts are enclosed in fleshy husks. The nut itself has a hard, thin, tan shell that partially splits open when the nut is ripe. The shells may be dyed red or blanched white by distributors to hide imperfections. Inside the shell is a smooth, pale-green ker- nel wrapped in a fine brownish skin. This kernel has a delicate and sweet flavor, which lends itself to desserts. Shelled and unshelled nuts should be kept in an airtight container in the refrig- erator, where they will keep for 3 months. Pistachios are available year-round. From a nutrition perspective, pistachios are an excellent source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and thiamin. The main source of fat in pistachios is monoun- saturated fat. Preparation Tips Pistachios with fully closed shells are imma- ture and should be avoided. The nuts can be eaten as a snack either raw or roasted. In addition, they can be added to puddings, cakes, candies, and luncheon meats. Or, chopped nuts can be added to stuffing, pâtés, and sauces",

In cuisine of Middle Eastern countries, sesame seeds are the main ingredient, along with honey and almonds, in a confection called halvah. Ground sesame seeds are also made into butter. In the Middle East, this is called tahini and is a popular addition to sauces and main dishes. Chickpeas and tahini can be com- bined to make hummus, a popular part of Middle Eastern cuisine. Squash Seed Cultivated worldwide, squash probably was first gathered by indigenous people around 8000 B.C., primarily for its seeds. European settlers arriving in North America found it was a common crop grown by American Indians. Although most people are familiar with eating the flesh of squash, the seeds of squash by themselves are both tasty and nutritious. The most popular squash seed eaten in the United States is the pumpkin seed, which is flat with one rounded end and one end that tapers to a point. The seeds are off-white and approximately three-quarters of an inch long. They enclose a green kernel that is delicately nutty in flavor. In Mexico, pumpkin seeds are known as pepitas and are popular in many dishes. The seeds of winter squash are also commonly eaten. The plants are harvested when the fruits and, hence, the seeds are fully ripe. Summer squash, in contrast, is eaten before it and its seeds are fully ripe. Seeds from acorn squash, buttercup squash, and butternut squash are also edible. The seeds are a healthful addition to your diet, Serving Suggestions In Asian and Mediterranean cuisine, it is common to find pistachios in meat and poultry dishes as well as in pastries",

Safflower Seed The safflower plant has been cultivated in India, China, Persia, and Egypt for centuries and it was only introduced in the United States in 1925. India still remains the largest producer of safflower seed. Common names for safflower seeds include safflower, false saffron, and saffron thistle. Safflower seeds are about a quarter of an inch long and elongated. They are an excellent source of iron, magnesium, thiamin, and riboflavin and a good source of potassium and niacin. Preparation Tips Safflower seeds are enclosed in a fibrous seed coat that must be removed before they can be eaten or pressed for oil. Up to 40 percent of the weight of the seeds is oil. Serving Suggestions The seeds of the safflower are eaten fried or roasted. They are one of the primary ingredients in an Indian dish called chutney. The plant’s shoots are also edible and often eaten as salad greens. Sesame Seed Sesame seeds are small, oval, and flat and have a paper-thin, edible hull. They may be white, yellow, brown, red, or black. Lighter-colored seeds are considered prefer- able to dark seeds. Sesame seeds are 40 to 60 percent oil by weight. They are an excellent source of iron, thiamin, riboflavin, and phos- phorus and a good source of potassium. Polyunsaturated fat is the primary source of fat.

Sunflower Seed With more than a hundred species, the sun- flower genus is thought to be native to either western North America or South America, although it now grows worldwide. The United States and the former coun- tries of the Soviet Union are among the largest producers of sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are about a quarter of an inch long, angular, and grayish green, tan, or black. They are enclosed in thin shells. Often, these shells are striped in black and white. Two main varieties of sun- flower are cultivated commercially. The Russian variety is grown mainly for oil because the seeds contain more than 40 percent oil by weight. The North American variety has larger seeds and is grown for human consumption and for bird food. Although high in calories and fat, sun- flower seeds contain mostly unsaturated fat. In addition, they are a rich source of Serving Suggestions Sunflower seeds can be eaten raw, roasted, and salted or unsalted and are terrific snacks by themselves. They also are excellent addi- tions to salads, stuffing, or yogurt. Ground seeds can be combined with flour to make breads, as is done in Portugal and Russia.

One reason is the mistaken belief that all dairy products are high in fat. Some are, but there is an abundance of low-fat and nonfat dairy products, from milk to yogurt to cheese. Other people do not consume dairy foods because of intolerance to milk sugar or allergy to milk proteins. However, those with intolerance to milk often do not need to follow a diet that is completely milk-free (see sidebar: Lactose Intolerance, page 347). People with allergy to milk must avoid dairy foods and may want to get help with adjust- ing their diets to ensure nutritional ade- quacy (see sidebar: Milk Allergy: Hidden Ingredients, page 349). M ilk is a bundle of nutrients, all contained in a nondescript white liquid. Although milk’s presence as a beverage at meals may not be as popular as it used to be, milk is used in many products that are consumed through- out the day. On the Food Guide Pyramid, milk and dairy products are placed near the top because, although they are part of a healthful diet, they should be consumed in moderation. Adults should consume 2 serv- ings of low-fat or nonfat dairy products daily; 1 serving equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt or 1 1/2 ounces of cheese. Children and pregnant or lactating women should add an extra serving each day. Milk and other dairy foods are rich in calcium, a mineral important for developing strong bones and teeth and for nerve transmission. They are also an important source of many vitamins and minerals",

Large quan- tities of these foods, however, are not needed to ensure that you are getting adequate amounts of these nutrients. Just three 8-ounce glasses of skim milk, for example, provide nearly all of the calcium you need each day. Another reason people do not consume dairy products is the growing consumption of soda pop. The average American drinks about a half gallon of milk a week but, in comparison, about 11 cans — or a gallon — of soda pop a week. Taking calcium sup- plements or eating calcium-enriched food can help you obtain needed calcium, but dairy foods are an easy way to get the calcium and other essential nutrients you need. Basics Milk can be consumed in its fluid form, in a more solid form (such as yogurt), as cheese, or as a major ingredient that is added to other foods. Dairy cases now abound with milk-based products and their reduced-fat and nonfat versions. The cornucopia of dairy products includes the following: Fluid milk — Although cow’s milk is generally consumed in the United States, other cultures use milk from goats, camels, llamas, reindeer, sheep, and water buffalo. Milk is a staple in diets worldwide. Dried and concentrated milk — These products include powdered milk, evaporated milk, and condensed milk. Cheese — Cheese is made by coagu- lating and draining milk or cream or a com- bination of both. Yogurt — Yogurt is made by adding bacteria to milk to ferment it. Ice cream and other dairy desserts — Ice cream and other frozen desserts are 346 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Nutrition Milk and dairy products provide many of the key nutrients needed daily, particularly calcium (for more specific information, refer to milk in the nutrient table on page 472). Milk and dairy products also supply high-quality protein. Because of its animal source, milk protein is complete — mean- ing it provides a sufficient amount of the nine essential amino acids (see Chapter 2, Protein, page 23)",

    "content": "Dairy products are also naturally rich in B vitamins and most of the minerals con- sidered to be essential in the diet, includ- ing calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iodine, and selenium. In addition, milk also contains several vitamins and minerals that have been added to meet the require- ments of the Food and Drug Administration. Low-fat and nonfat milk may be fortified with vitamin A because this fat-soluble vitamin is lost when the milk fat is removed. Vitamin D is added to all milk to help the body better use calcium. Milk also is a good source of carbohy- drates. With the exception of cheeses and butter, milk products are higher in carbo- hydrates than protein or fat. Milk’s carbo- hydrate is lactose, a sugar unique to milk that is actually two sugars (glucose and galactose) linked together. Food scientists call this type of sugar a “disaccharide.” Lactose is not as sweet as other sugars. It helps the body absorb calcium and phos- phorus and may even help in the growth of friendly bacteria needed in the intestines. In addition, galactose, one of the sugars in lactose, is a vital part of brain and nerve tissue. It is released when the body digests lactose. Lactose is a bit of a paradox, how- ever. Although it has these beneficial properties, many people have difficulty digesting milk (see sidebar: Lactose Intolerance, page 347). Pasteurization kills bacteria that have been responsible for major plagues such as tuberculosis, polio, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever. It is also advantageous because it destroys many of the bacteria that cause spoilage and many of the enzymes that pro- mote rancidity. Pasteurization, therefore, increases both shelf life and safety of milk. A common term that consumers see when purchasing milk is “homogenized.” Homogenization is a process introduced in the 1950s in which fat globules in the milk are broken down so they are evenly dis- persed throughout the milk. Most milk at the supermarket is homogenized",

Cream and sour cream — Cream is the fat that rises to the top of the surface in unprocessed milk. Sour cream is simply cream that has been fermented or thickened. The cream is usually “soured” by adding bacteria to it, much in the way that yogurt is created. Butter — This yellowish substance is essentially fat that has been separated from cream. For that reason, it is discussed in Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners, page 389. Processing of Milk and Milk Products Virtually all milk and milk used in dairy products is pasteurized. Pasteurization is a process invented by French chemist Louis Pasteur. It uses heat to destroy harmful bacteria in milk, but it retains the nutri- tional value of milk. The processing of milk begins at the farm. Despite all the nutrients in milk, the nutritional advantages of dairy products must be weighed against the potential health drawbacks of two key components in milk: sodium and fat. Whole milk, cream, and cheeses contain substantial amounts of fat, especially saturated fat. These fats add calories and have been tied to higher cho- lesterol levels and cardiovascular disease (see Chapter 3, Coronary Artery Disease, page 61). However, it is important to note that low-fat and nonfat milk varieties are avail- able and are significantly lower in fat than whole milk. In addition, depending on how much is consumed, milk or products made from milk may be a major source of sodium — a special concern for anyone following a low-sodium diet.

Semi-firm and hard cheeses, such as cheddar and Monterey Jack, will keep as long or longer. Generally, the harder the cheese, the longer it will remain fresh when carefully stored. Shredded cheese will not keep as long because it has more surface exposed to the air. Soft cheese that has mold on it should be discarded. Firm cheese that has mold can sometimes be used as long as 1/2 inch to 1 Selection Unless dried or canned, milk and dairy prod- ucts are perishable. For that reason, most have an expiration date printed on the pack- aging. The date often states, “Sell by . .” and is a good indicator of freshness. Look for the date before buying and before consum- ing a product. Usually, dairy products will keep about a week beyond that date. Storage Keep milk in the coldest part of your refrig- erator. Avoid storing milk in the refriger- ator door unless it has a special compart- ment designed to keep the milk colder than in the rest of the refrigerator. Keep yogurt and fresh cheeses in air- tight containers in the refrigerator. Loosely LACTOSE INTOLERANCE As many as 50 million Americans are estimated to have lactose intolerance — an inability to adequately digest ordinary amounts of dairy products such as milk and ice cream. Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of the adult population is thought to be lactose intolerant, and the condition is very common among American Indians and those of Asian, African, Hispanic, and Mediterranean descent. Lactose is the sugar that is naturally present in milk and milk products. It must be broken down by lactase (an enzyme found in the intestine) before the body can use it. If there is not enough lactase, undigested milk sugar remains in the intestine. Bacteria in the colon then ferment this sugar. Gas, cramping, and diarrhea can follow. Most of us begin to lose intestinal lactase as we age. However, this occurs to varying degrees",

Thus, people with lactase deficiency vary in their ability to comfortably digest milk and milk products. As obvious as the symptoms of lactose intolerance may be, it is not easily diagnosed from the symptoms alone. Many other conditions, including stomach flu and irritable bowel syndrome, can cause similar symptoms. See your physician to determine whether you are lactose intolerant. Measurement of the hydrogen in your breath after you have taken in lactose is a useful test because large amounts of hydrogen indicate that lactose is not being fully digested and that you are probably intolerant. Persons with milk allergies should avoid milk, but those with lactose intolerance often do not need to follow a diet that is completely lactose-free. The following suggestions may help: • Avoid eating or drinking large servings of dairy products at one time. (Several smaller servings over the course of a few hours are much easier to digest.) • Drink milk or eat dairy products with a meal. • Choose hard or aged cheeses, such as Swiss or cheddar, over fresh varieties. Hard cheeses have smaller amounts of lactose and are more likely to be tolerated. • Take lactase tablets or drops, such as Lactaid or Dairy Ease. These types of products contain the enzyme that breaks down lactose, reducing the amount that your body must digest on its own.

However, if you have lactose intolerance, you usually can eat small amounts of dairy food without problems. In contrast, a tiny amount of a food to which you are allergic can trigger a reaction. If you suspect that you have any food allergies, see your physician. You may then be referred to an allergist for a careful eval- uation. This generally includes a medical history, physical examination, and skin or blood testing. If the diagnosis is a milk aller- gy, it is essential to eliminate milk and foods made with milk from your diet (see sidebar: Milk Allergy: Hidden Ingredients, page 349). Milk Milk has a wide variety of uses and thus is one of the most basic items found in kitchens worldwide. It is consumed as a beverage, poured on cereals, and used in many different ways in cooking. In response to consumers with different nutritional demands, modern food science has made many different types of fluid milk available. Although milk can be less inviting to people who are concerned with their weight because of its high fat content, some types of milk contain no fat at all. Whole milk — Containing 3 1/2 per- cent milk fat, this type of milk is often sim- ply labeled “milk” or “vitamin D milk” if that particular vitamin has been added. Of all types of milk, whole milk is among the highest in fat and calories. One cup has 150 calories and approximately 8 grams of fat. and medications",

Drinking acidophilus milk products may reduce intestinal infection and diarrhea and improve milk digestion and tolerance. Studies are under way to evaluate whether these bacteria can help regulate blood cholesterol levels and prevent cancer. Calories and fat in acidophilus milk depend on what type of milk was cultured with the acidophilus bacterium. If whole milk was used, for example, acidophilus- treated milk contains the same amount of fat and calories as whole milk. Lactose-reduced and lactose-free milk — These products are tailored to people who have trouble digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk. An enzyme called lactase is added during the processing of this milk. The result is that lactose in the milk is reduced by at least 70 percent (lactose- reduced) or up to 99.9 percent (lactose-free). Calories and fat in lactose-reduced and lac- tose-free milk depend on what type of milk was cultured. Dairy Foods 349 Flavored milks are higher in calories than their unflavored counterparts. Calories and fat in flavored milk range from 150 calories and no fat for 1 cup of chocolate milk made from skim milk to more than 210 calories and 8 grams of fat for 1 cup of whole chocolate milk. When purchasing flavored milks, look for products that are made from skim or reduced-fat milk. Avoid those labeled “premium.” They often are made from whole milk, which is high in fat. Preparation Tips It is easy to overcook milk when heating it. When milk is heated to a temperature that is too high, its proteins clump together and curds appear in the milk. When heating milk, always use low heat and stir frequently. Using a double boiler when heating milk also helps prevent overheating. Anyone who has ever had homemade hot cocoa knows that heated milk can develop a “skin” (a thickened surface)",

Ultrapasteurized milk (UHT) — This milk has been popular in Europe for many years, but it has only recently appeared in U.S. supermarkets. The “ultra-heat treat- ment” (UHT) sterilizes milk by quickly heating it, sometimes as high as 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and then quickly cooling it before packaging it in vacuum-packed, asep- tic containers. UHT milk can be stored for 2 to 3 months without refrigeration, until opened. Once opened, UHT milk should be refrigerated and quickly con- sumed. It can spoil, but unlike other milk, it does not curdle as a warning sign of spoilage. The ultra-heat process makes the milk taste slightly scalded, but it is thought that the treatment does not substantially affect the nutrient value. The amount of fat and calories in UHT milk depends on the type of milk from which it was made. Flavored milk — Flavorings, sugar, or other sweeteners are added to fluid milk. Although some milk is flavored with straw- berry, vanilla, and even peanut butter flavorings, chocolate is used most commonly. If you are allergic to milk, it is impor- tant to check the labels of the foods you eat. Milk or components of milk are common ingredients in many dif- ferent foods, some of which you might not be aware of. Foods that likely contain milk include the following: • Butter, including artificial butter flavor, butter fat, ghee, buttermilk • Chocolate, caramel, nougat • Cheese, including cream cheese, cottage cheese, and cheese curds • Simplesse (a fat substitute) • Luncheon meats, hot dogs, and sausages • Cream, including half-and-half, nondairy creamers (containing casein) • Margarine • Yogurt • So-called nondairy items, including coffee lighteners, whipped toppings, imitation cheeses, and frozen or soft- serve dessert items.

Can everyone in the family drink the same milk, or should you buy certain milk for only the youngest members? Breast milk, of course, is recom- mended during the first year of life. If the infant is weaned during the first year, the best alternative is to use iron-fortified formula. Formula-fed infants should remain on iron-forti- fied formula until 1 year of age. After age 1, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using whole milk if the use of breast milk or formula is discontinued. Until age 2, fat should not be limited in an infant’s diet. After age 2 years, children can begin to consume fat in moderation, just as the rest of the family does. However, whether to use low-fat milk will vary for each child. If a child has had poor growth or a chronic medical condition, discuss the appropriate fat content of milk — and diet in general — with the child’s physician",

SOY AND RICE “MILK” Nondairy beverages made from soy- beans and rice are available for persons who have milk allergies, are lactose-intolerant, or prefer not to eat animal products. Both soy milk and rice milk are similar in look and taste to milk and can be used for many of the same purposes, such as pouring on cereal or making smoothies and other dairy-based beverages. Soymilk is made from water, soybeans, malted corn and barley extract, seaweed (used for thickening purposes), salt, and, depending on the brand, a fat or oil. Rice milk is made from water, brown rice, salt, and, depending on the brand, saf- flower oil and various vitamins and minerals.

Evaporated milk — Packaged in sealed cans, evaporated milk is milk from which about 60 percent of water has been evapo- rated. The milk is homogenized and packed in heat-sterilized cans that help extend shelf life. Unopened cans can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 months but should be refrigerated and used within 5 days after being opened. Evaporated milk has a slightly darker color than regular milk because it was heated during the evapora- tion process. Sweetened condensed milk — Thick and sold in sealed cans, condensed milk is often used to make desserts because it is usually sweetened.

The thickest of the “sweet creams,” heavy cream is used mainly for whipping cream and for desserts. A lower-fat version, with 30 to 36 percent milk fat, is called light whipping cream. For this cream to whip properly, emulsi- fiers and stabilizers are added to the cream. Both products double in volume when whipped. For this reason, whipping cream is also called double cream.

Cheese can be made from various milks. Milk from cows is typically used in the United States, but milk from sheep, goats, camels, and other animals is used worldwide. In fact, some of the world’s finest gourmet cheeses are made from sheep’s milk. No matter what type of milk is used, the process is essentially the same.

It is made by adding a small amount of buttermilk to cream and heating the mixture. It is then stored in a warm place until it thickens. This usually takes between 12 and 36 hours. The mixture is then refrigerated and can be kept up to a week. Smetana — A dense Russian sour cream, smetana is traditionally served on borscht and salads. It is also known by the names smitane, smatana, or sliuki. Then the curds are pressed into shapes. Salt may be added at this point.

Because they are aged for just a few weeks, they have a soft, moist texture and mild flavor. Semisoft cheeses are used widely in cooking because they melt smoothly and easily. They are also easy to slice and so are excellent for hors d’oeuvres or for more ordinary uses, such as sandwich toppings. Because these cheeses are soft, they are often coated with wax or another material to keep them intact. Some types of semi- soft cheeses are aged. Others are “washed” in brine, which causes them to develop a rind on the outside. These processes also intensify the cheese’s flavor and, in some instances, sodium content.

However, it does need to be pasteurized for the same reasons cow’s milk should — to kill any germs that might be harmful to humans. Goat’s milk is not an acceptable alternative for persons who are lactose-intoler- ant, because it contains lactose in the same percentage as cow’s milk. Nor is goat’s milk or goat cheese a lower-fat alternative. Some people prefer the taste and texture of goat cheese, but 1 1/2 ounces of hard goat cheese has 13 grams of fat — about the same as cheese made from whole cow's milk, such as cheddar.

So-named because they become hardened with age, hard and firm cheeses include the well-known cheddar and Parmesan varieties. They have a strong flavor and are widely used in cooking. They are also richer in calcium than softer cheeses because more milk is used in their produc- tion. However, this also means they are higher in fat and calories and so should be used in moderation in a healthful diet. Hard and firm cheeses are divided into these categories: Hard grating cheeses — Hard grating cheeses include Parmesan and Romano. As the name suggests, they are often grated before use, but they can be served as chunks. Both cheeses originated in Italy. Parmesan cheese takes its name from the Parma region, where this cheese may be aged up to 4 years. Romano cheese prob- ably originated in Rome. Italian versions are made from sheep’s milk; American ver- sions, in contrast, are made from cow’s milk. Both types are common toppings for Italian favorites such as spaghetti. In general, these cheeses have a tangy flavor and pleasing aroma. During production, they are heat- ed to set the curd and reduce moisture. Aging enhances their flavor and results in their texture becoming more crumbly. Cheddar-type cheeses — Cheddar cheese originated in the English village of Cheddar and has since been adopted by cheese lovers all over the world. Cheddar’s distinct bite can range from mild to sharp, and the cheese is often seasoned with wine or spices. Cheddar cheese’s characteristic color is orange — the result of adding a natural vegetable coloring called annatto during production.

Blue or Blue-Veined Cheeses Blue-veined cheeses are created by the intro- duction of a blue mold into the milk before it thickens. The blue color, however, would not appear as the characteristic blue-green veins in cheeses without exposure to air. Therefore, the cheese is pierced with steel rods to let air circulate. Most blue cheeses are made in the style of classic European blue cheeses. They can be firm or creamy and any color from chalk-white to golden-yellow. The flavor of these cheeses grows stronger with age. Although these cheeses are high in fat, only a small amount is typically used because of their strong flavor. Blue cheeses keep for 1 to 4 weeks after purchase. Classic or blue-veined cheeses include: Gorgonzola — Sold in wheels, Gorgonzola is an Italian specialty. The interior of the cheese is white with veins that are usually more green than blue. Roquefort — Named for the area in France where the cheese is said to have originated, Roquefort has a crumbly tex- ture and a sharp flavor. It is made from sheep’s milk. of fat. However, semisoft cheeses general- ly contain less fat and calories than hard cheeses because less milk is used to make semisoft cheeses than hard cheeses. Soft, White-Rind Cheeses Soft, white-rind cheeses are descendents of natural-rind cheeses, in which gray, green, and even red molds are allowed to grow on the surface of the cheese as it ripens",

Imitation cheese does not necessarily mean the product contains no milk: it may use casein (a milk protein) and emulsifiers, enzymes, and artificial flavorings and colors. Other imita- tion cheeses are made from soybean derivatives. Both reduced-fat and imitation cheeses can be used as you would use regular cheese if you do not plan to cook the cheese. Both reduced-fat and imitation cheeses tend to have a denser, more rubbery texture when heated and may not melt in the way traditional cheese does. Dairy Foods 357 Colby — A blander, more moist cheese than cheddar, Colby was developed in Wisconsin a century ago. Gruyère-type cheeses — Carbon diox- ide gases trapped inside the cheese while it is ripening create the characteristic “eyes” of this type of cheese. The cheese usually is a straw-yellow color and has a mild to rich, full flavor. Monterey Jack — A mild, light-colored cheese, Monterey Jack also may be spiced up with bits of jalapeno peppers, pepper- oni, or herbs and spices. Swiss cheese — Known for the holes in it, Swiss cheese is a golden-yellow cheese and has a tangy flavor. The holes in it are caused by pockets of gas that develop when the cheese is made. Processed Cheeses Processed cheese is the most common type of cheese eaten in the United States, where it was originally developed. In processed cheese, one or more types of cheese are heated (which stops the aging process) and melted. An emulsifier is then added as a binding agent",

A common type of processed cheese is American cheese, which is usually derived from cheddar cheese. Processed cheeses have a mild flavor and melt easily and smoothly. They have a number of uses, from spreads to pasta top- pings to dips. However, there are nutri- tional trade-offs. Processed cheeses are often higher in sodium than traditional cheeses and are somewhat lower in protein and other nutrients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely regulates the composition of processed cheese. Label terms that indi- cate you are using a processed cheese include pasteurized process cheese, cheese food, and cheese spread. Preparation Tips To get the most flavor from your cheese, it should be allowed to warm to room tem- perature. Therefore, take cheese out of the refrigerator an hour in advance of when you plan to serve it. Keep the wrapper intact so the cheese does not dry out. The opposite is true if you plan to grate cheese. It grates better when it is cold, and 10 minutes in the freezer speeds the process. When melting cheese, use a gradual, medium heat, because it can turn rubbery when heated at a high temperature. Serving Suggestions Because most cheese is high in fat — about 40 percent of which is saturated — it should accompany other foods rather than be the centerpiece of a meal. Also, most cheeses are high in sodium because of the salt used for curing and flavoring. That said, the flavor and texture of cheese mean that large quantities are not needed to enjoy it. Cheese is excellent as a garnish for soups and salads. Or, crumble bits of real blue cheese on your salad instead of pour- ing on fat-filled blue cheese dressing",

    "content": "The Migraines, also called vascular headaches, are thought to involve blood vessels in the brain, although the exact cause is unknown. Some cheeses contain a naturally occurring compound called tyramine, which, in susceptible people, can cause an increase in blood pressure, an increase in the size of blood vessels in the brain, and headache pain. For people who take drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), avoidance of all foods containing tyramine — includ- ing aged cheeses — is essential. Tyramine is found naturally in food. It is formed from the breakdown of protein as foods age. Few studies have measured tyramine content in cheese. However, the research that has been done indicates that the longer a cheese has aged, the greater its tyra- mine content. Compared with other foods, aged cheeses have the highest tyramine content. The amount of tyramine in cheeses differs greatly because of the variations in processing, fermenting, aging, degradation, or even bacterial contamination. The following types of cheeses are aged or have been reported to be high in tyramine and should be avoided if you are susceptible to migraines or if you take MAOIs: • Blue cheeses • Brie • Cheddar • English Stilton • Feta • Gorgonzola • Mozzarella • Muenster • Parmesan • Swiss MIGRAINES AND CHEESE result is a more authentic blue cheese taste with less fat and fewer calories. Top pasta with a small serving of grated cheese, such as Romano or Parmesan, but lean heavily on a vegetable-based sauce. Use a single slice of cheese atop a veggie-filled sandwich, or trade the cheese for a lean slice of turkey. When making nachos, sprinkle baked tortilla pieces lightly with sharp cheddar cheese and then top the chips with plenty of healthier options: vegetables, beans, and salsa. If you have a craving for pizza, make your own. Take-out pizzas, especially if ordered with extra cheese, can supply the entire day’s fat supply with one piece.

Other types of yogurt are pasteurized again after the cultures have sufficiently fermented the yogurt. This type is labeled “heat-treated.” Active yogurt cultures help to digest casein, a protein found in milk. There is also some evidence that active yogurt cultures replenish the “friendly” bacteria in our intestines after the supply dwindles. This decrease in bacteria happens because of normal aging, illness, or use of some medications. Yogurt did not attract Americans’ atten- tion until the health-food movement of the 1960s. Even now, Europeans still consume 5 times as much yogurt as North Americans. Consumption in America is growing with the increased marketing of yogurt that has additional flavors added. One caution: added flavors can add calories and fat. Preparation Tips Plain yogurt can be used in place of cream or mayonnaise in recipes, but the result will be less creamy and more tart. Cooking with Today’s yogurt, however, is created in a much more sophisticated manner. The process starts with the milk. The type of milk used defines the fat, calories, and, con- sequently, the richness of the yogurt. For example, nonfat yogurt comes from nonfat milk, and low-fat yogurt is derived from low-fat milk. The milk is then pasteurized. One of the two milk proteins — the whey — is coagulated to create yogurt’s characteristic glutinous consistency, and the substance is then homogenized and cooled. The true yogurt-making process then begins with the introduction of the starter bacteria cultures",

In North America, the two most common bacteria strains used are Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. These two types of friendly bac- teria change the milk’s sugar (called lactose) into lactic acid. The lactic acid is respon- sible for the tangy, acidic taste of yogurt. The more bacterial strains used, the stronger the acidic flavor. Some of the bacterial cultures survive the yogurt-making process. This type of yogurt will list “active yogurt cultures” or TRANSLATING AT THE CHEESE COUNTER Cheese is a staple and a specialty in many cultures, almost all of which import cheese from one another.

Make sure to allow yogurt to warm to room temperature before slowly heating it. Low-fat and nonfat versions of plain yogurt can be used in many recipes that call for sour cream. The acidity from the lactic acid creates a taste similar to that of sour cream, but the texture is a bit compromised. However, a half cup of sour cream has 214 calories and 21 grams of fat, and the same amount of low-fat yogurt has 63 calories and 2 grams of fat. From a health stand- point, therefore, the texture becomes sec- ondary. Another option would to be to use half sour cream and half yogurt. Because yogurt contains an acid that can work as a tenderizer, it makes a won- derful marinade for meats. Tandoori chicken, an Indian dish, is probably the most well-known yogurt-marinaded meal. The basic marinade consists of lemon juice and plain yogurt. Yogurt can be used for fruit and veg- etable dips, atop baked potatoes or cold cereals, or in stroganoff recipes.

The dessert made its pilgrimage to North America in 1774, when caterer Phillip Lenzi told a New York newspaper that he would be selling a dessert he had discovered in London called “ice cream.” NONDAIRY DESSERTS Many items available in the “ice cream” section of your local super- market are not derived from dairy products",

Air does not determine the difference between soft- serve and hard ice creams, however. Soft- serve ice cream is not allowed to freeze fully, so it maintains its “soft” consistency and can easily be manipulated by machine into cones or containers.

Serving Suggestions Ice cream is delicious, but it should be an occasional indulgence, given the amount of calories and fat in it. When it is time to splurge, limit the amount of ice cream or other dessert treat to a small serving instead of filling a bowl. In addition, choose a frozen dessert that has less than 3 grams of fat per half cup, and use it as a foundation to enhance other, healthier foods. For example, add fruit — such as strawberries or bananas — to ice cream in equal ratios instead of pouring on the chocolate syrup. To lower your fat intake, choose sorbets and fruit ices or low-fat ice cream and ice cream substitutes.

The definition of herbs has varied throughout the ages. Generally, herbs are now considered to be the aromatic leaves of plants that grow in a variety of climates. The leaves are used fresh, dried, chopped, or crushed to add a subtle taste to foods or oils. Sometimes they are steeped in water for teas and other beverages",

Spices have many of the same uses as herbs. They are usually grown in tropical areas. Often, they have a more intense fla- vor and are derived from a wider range of plant parts: the fruit, seed, roots, flower bud, or bark. Spices are usually added at the beginning of the cooking process. Both herbs and spices can be crushed for nonculinary uses: for medicinal pur- poses (see Chapter 2, sidebar: Herbal Products, page 37) or for use as fragrances in perfumes or lotions. Nutrition Herbs generally contain less fat and carbo- hydrates than spices. Both do contain some nutrients. For example, basil and cloves contain calcium and potassium. The small amounts of herbs and spices used in cook- ing, however, minimize the nutritional con- tributions they might make in this way. Herbs and spices add only a negligible number of calories to the foods to which they are added. As a result, they are an excellent replacement for both fat and salt when it comes to flavoring food. Creative use of herbs and spices can make it far easier to enjoy your meals while maintaining a healthful diet. Selection Fresh herbs and spices deliver the most pleasing flavor. For that reason, many serious cooks buy spices whole (such as the whole seed or stem) and grow their own. In addi- tion, many cooks have their own herb gardens to have fresh herbs on hand. Herbs are both easy to grow and attractive. They are almost always perennial plants, so they come back year after year. Fortunately, for those without a green thumb, fresh herbs and spices are increas- ingly available at the supermarket. When H erbs and spices have been added to foods throughout history for preservation and flavor. Although they are plentiful and inexpensive today, herbs, spices, and other flavorings were considered as valuable as gold or jewels for many centuries",

If you think about it, it is easy to understand why people long ago placed such an emphasis on flavorings for their food. Easy refrigeration of food has been only a recent development. Before its development, food perished rapidly and thus had a bad taste when eaten. Some food was preserved with large quantities of salt. In addition, the wide variety of foods—particularly fresh fruits and vegetables—that we enjoy today was not available. As a result, the daily diet of people throughout much of history was bland and unexciting. It is no wonder that herbs and spices were valued. Today, modern technology, agriculture, and transportation systems make our diets full of abundance and variety. Herbs and spices, although no longer worth their weight in gold, nevertheless still play a crucial role in shaping cuisine and adding interest to foods. They may also play a role in health, offering an opportunity to add flavor without adding the health drawbacks of excess fat or salt. 364 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods and change the water every few days.

Fresh herbs are highly perishable and may last only a few days in the refrigerator. Maximize their shelf life by managing their moisture. They need some to avoid wilting. However, too much can cause them to rot. A solution is to pack fresh herbs in a per- forated plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper, which will help keep the air around the product humid. Pat excess moisture off the leaves with a paper towel before putting the bag in the crisper. This storage method works for most herbs, but there is a better one for basil, cilantro, sage, mint, parsley, and other leafy herbs. They are best stored like a flower bouquet. Tie the leaves together, stems down, and put them in a container filled with cold water. Store in the refrigerator buying them, look for products that appear the freshest — those whose appearance and aroma indicate that the time since they were harvested has been minimal. Avoid products that have mold on them or are discolored. Dried herbs and spices are also widely available. A general rule is that 1/4 teaspoon ground leaves or 1 teaspoon dried leaves should be used for each tablespoon of fresh product. Storage Both herbs and spices can lose their poten- cy over time, which is why proper storage is critical. How this is done depends on the type of product purchased. Whole spice seeds keep longer than ground spices. Both should be kept in tight- ly closed containers in a cool, dry place. Dried herbs should be stored in the same way. Exposure to light and heat can cause leaves to deteriorate. A rule for determin- ing whether the product is still good is to test its aroma.

With the growing interest in alternative medicine, many physicians and scientists have begun studying the therapeutic potential of these plants. In some cases, they have found that some plants or extracts made from them have promise in fighting disease or maintaining health. However, some of the most promising plants — such as saw palmetto for prostate enlargement — typically are not found in kitchens. Nor is it likely that the small amounts of herbs and spices used in cooking deliver any medical benefits. More study is needed to establish the role of these plants in health. Until research is complete, it is best to avoid relying on them for medical purposes or, at the very least, you should see a qualified medical practitioner before you use them. Using them in place of traditional medicines may have harmful effects. Side effects can result from improperly using just about any so-called natural product.

Fennel Fennel has long, green, feathery leaves on cel- ery-like stems. Both stem and leaves have a delicate, anise-like flavor and may be eaten as a vegetable. Flowers produce seeds that may also be used as a flavoring. Raw fennel stems also can add a subtle and different flavor to custard and ice cream. Lemon Balm A member of the mint family, lemon balm imparts a strong lemony flavor to foods. Use it in fruit or vegetable salads, to gar- nish fish, or to freshen drinks. Lemon balm can stand in for lemon peel in most recipes. In ancient times it was used to “balm” (comfort) wounds and to flavor alcoholic beverages such as claret and mead.

Vinegar is used in almost every culture as a condiment. It can be made from a wide range of foodstuffs — from grains, fruits, wine, or even ethyl alcohol. Essentially, the process to turn any of these into vinegar is the same. Bacteria is added to an alcohol solution to convert the alcohol in acetic acid. The liquid is then processed and pasteurized to kill any organisms in it that might be harmful to humans. It also may be distilled before it is bottled for consumer use. Vinegar's tart, acidic flavor makes it a versatile ingredient. It is often used to make vinaigrette dressings, mustards, or marinades, as a condiment for seafood, or to flavor dishes in which beans are the primary ingredient.

This label is clear in practical terms in any kitchen or restau- rant. Served by itself or as part of some- thing else, water is a basic ingredient in all beverages. Throughout history, water has been heated, chilled, brewed, carbonated, had herbs and other flavorings steeped in it, or been added to other ingredients and fer- mented. The result is a rich array of bev- erages to choose from: Coffee—Brewed from the roasted beans of the semitropical coffee plant, coffee is enjoyed around the world, and each cul- ture offers a different variation on this basic beverage. Tea—Another beverage that crosses cul- tural lines, tea is water that is heated with dried leaves from the evergreen shrub Camellia sinensis. A variation is herbal tea, in which herbs such as chamomile are used. Juice—The liquid squeezed from fruits and vegetables has been enjoyed as a bev- erage throughout history. Soda pop—A beverage of the modern age, this highly sweetened carbonated drink is popular despite its nutritional drawbacks. It’s high in sugar and calories and has no appreciable nutrients in it. Wine—At its most basic, wine is sim- ply fermented grape juice, which of course is made up mainly of water. There are thou- sands of variations of this ancient alcoholic drink. Beer—Another international beverage, beer is water brewed with yeast, hops, and other ingredients to yield a carbonated, alco- holic drink with a distinctive taste and yeasty smell that is enjoyed around the globe. Of course, water itself should not be overlooked as a beverage. Served through- out history to quench thirst and comple- ment meals, water is now available in a myr- iad of forms, from bottled to carbonated to straight from the tap. The numerous vari- eties of water sold commercially make it easy to enjoy this clear, colorless, calorie-free, and most ancient of all beverages",

At meals, they make a flavorful complement for foods. Special occasions are marked by toasts of a favorite beverage. Drinking coffee, tea, soda pop, juice, or water is often used to designate breaks during an ordinary workday. Beverages are as diverse as the cultural landscape worldwide. Like the food choices we make, the choosing of beverages plays a crucial role in our health. Drinking enough water, for example, is critical for many different body processes and thus is vital for good health. In contrast, beverages high in calories, fat, or sugar can contribute to obesity, tooth decay, and other health problems. Those high in caffeine, a chemical stimulant, can have other health drawbacks if consumed in excess. Beverages high in alcohol can affect our judgment and coordination and may even be addictive. Perhaps at no other point in time has there ever been such a wide variety of beverages available. To help you make the most healthful choice, the following sections contain information about many of the most widely used beverages (information about milk is contained in Dairy Foods, page 345). 378 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods introduced in the late 1700s and is con- sidered the forerunner of soda pop. Soda water—A carbonated water that contains sodium bicarbonate. Club soda—The same as soda water except that mineral salts have been added. Tonic water—Tonic water has been carbonated and flavored with fruit extracts, sugar, or quinine. Most water sold commercially comes in handy storage containers—usually cans or tightly sealed bottles. Water in these containers can be kept indefinitely, chilled or in the pantry. Be sure not to let con- tainers freeze, particularly carbonated types of water. Unlike other substances, water’s volume expands when it freezes. The result- ing ice will break the container",

Water Concerns about the safety of tap water have resulted in a burgeoning market for bottled water, making it one of the most widely sold commercial beverages. Within the cat- egory of bottled water, there is a vast array of water types from which to choose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates bottled water, classifies them in this way: Artesian water—This type of water is drawn from a confined aquifer (a rock for- mation containing water that stands above the natural water table). Distilled water—This is water that has been evaporated and then condensed, leav- ing it free of dissolved minerals. Purified water—Purified water has been demineralized. It is produced by deionization (passing it through resins) or by reverse osmosis (passing it through filters to remove dissolved minerals). Distilled water is also considered purified water. Mineral water—Water that contains no less than 250 parts per million (ppm) of totally dissolved, naturally occurring solids or minerals. Mineral water can be labeled “low mineral content” (less than 500 ppm) or “high mineral content” (more than 1,500 ppm). Spring water—Spring water is obtained from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface. It also can be collected through a bore drilled into the spring. Sparkling water—Another name for carbonated water, sparkling water contains carbon dioxide gas that is in it naturally or has been added to it. Seltzer water—A type of sparkling water. The name comes from the town of Nieder Selters in Germany. Seltzer was the water that is their basic ingredient or the process that the water has been through. For example, drinks high in sugar are also high in calories. Alcoholic drinks are also high in calories. The most important nutritional infor- mation to remember about beverages, how- ever, is how vital water is to your health and that most people do not drink enough water. The recommended daily amount is eight 8-ounce glasses of water",

    "content": "The recommended daily amount is eight 8-ounce glasses of water. To understand why water is so impor- tant, consider that your body is one-half to four-fifths water. Every system in your body depends on water. Water regulates your body temperature, removes wastes, carries nutrients and oxygen to your cells, cushions your joints, helps prevent consti- pation, aids kidney function, and helps dis- solve vitamins, minerals, and other nutri- ents to make them accessible to your body. Lack of water can lead to dehydration. Even slight dehydration can sap your energy, contribute to headaches, and make you feel lethargic. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and very old. You lose about 10 cups of fluid a day through sweating, exhaling, urinating, and bowel movements. Exercising or engaging in any activity that causes you to perspire increases your daily water requirement, as does hot, humid, or cold weather and high altitudes. Some beverages, such as those with caffeine and alcohol, are dehydrating, so if you drink them, you need even more water to compensate. Storage and Selection Storage and selection of beverages depend on what it is you plan to drink. The follow- ing sections provide this information and more for some of the most common and widely used beverages. Preparation Tips Most tap water in the United States is safe to drink. Try serving tap water with ice and a slice of lemon or lime, which gives the water a pleasing taste. Prices for bottled water range a great deal. Generally, howev- er, less expensive types of bottled water com- pare favorably with more expensive versions. Serving Suggestions Water is an excellent beverage for any occa- sion. Try serving sparkling water for special occasions, putting it in a champagne flute or wine goblet for added visual appeal. For everyday occasions, make water the default beverage you choose. Soda pop and other beverages should be chosen far less frequently",

Keep a bottle with you during the day or take regular water breaks. Beverages 379 used commercially are one of two main species: Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta. Most of the beans used around the world are arabica beans, which are grown at a high altitude, require plenty of rainfall, and are considered somewhat difficult to cultivate. Robusta beans flourish at lower altitudes with less intense care. Arabica beans, however, are thought to produce the finest flavor. They are also the most expensive coffee beans. For this rea- son, supermarket coffees contain mostly robusta beans, although some arabica beans may be mixed in for a richer flavor. Despite the less intense flavor of robusta beans, they have about twice the caffeine content of arabica beans (see sidebar: Decaffeinating Coffee Beans, page 380). Coffee beans can be roasted, ground, mixed, brewed, and flavored in various ways. Coffee Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a cherry- like fruit of the semitropical coffee plant, which is grown in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and parts of Africa and Central America. The seeds are separated from the coffee fruit and then roasted. During roast- ing they acquire the rich, dark-brown color (a result of caramelization, melting, and subsequent browning of sugars in the beans) most people associate with coffee beans. Roasting time affects both the flavor and the color of coffee beans. Generally, the darker the beans, the longer they have been roasted. Longer roasted beans also typi- cally have the most intense flavor. There are dozens of varieties of coffees, many of them named after their country or port of origin. However, all coffee beans SAFETY OF TAP WATER Many Americans are concerned about the safety of their tap water, which has led to a dramatic increase in sales of water filtration systems and bottled water. Most tap water, however, is fine",

However, small amounts of microbiological and chemical contaminants are allowed within EPA limits of safety or when water treatment equipment breaks down. The EPA requires public suppliers to notify consumers if water from public supplies does not meet safety standards. Common coffee drinks: café latte, perked coffee, espresso The result? Numerous specialty coffee drinks for coffee connoisseurs to choose from: Espresso—This dark, strong, and con- centrated coffee is made by forcing hot water through coffee that is very finely ground, darkly roasted, and specially blend- ed. It is so rich that when served unadorned, only a small quantity is needed. Thus, espresso usually is served in a tiny cup, often referred to as a demitasse. Espresso also may be the foundation of other specialty coffee drinks. A welcome consequence is that excellent coffee can be made at home. The outcome of home brewing, although somewhat dependent on the equipment you own, is affected mainly by the type of coffee you buy. Perhaps the best thing you can do to ensure a good cup of coffee is to buy fresh, whole beans, grinding them just before brewing. Follow grinding instructions on your grinder carefully, paying particular attention to recommended grind times. Avoid beans or preground coffee packed in the large, traditional round canisters. This packing method almost always allows some oxygen into the container, which can cause the coffee to become stale. Instead, look for coffee sold in vacuum-packed bags, which have a mechanism that allows gas in the container to escape but does not let any in. 380 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Café au lait—From the French for “coffee with milk,” café au lait is made with equal parts of regular coffee and scalded milk.

    "content": "In France and Quebec, café au lait is considered a morning tradition. Café latte—Very similar to café au lait, this coffee beverage is equal parts of foamy steamed milk and espresso. Café mocha—More dessert than bev- erage, café mocha is made with espresso, chocolate syrup, and foamy, steamed milk. The chocolate syrup adds considerable calo- ries to this coffee drink. Cappuccino—This is espresso topped with the creamy foam from steamed milk. Some of this milk may be added to the espresso. Sometimes sweetened cinnamon, cocoa, or vanilla powder is sprinkled over the foamed milk. Turkish coffee—An intensely flavored coffee beverage, Turkish coffee is made by bringing finely ground coffee to a boil several times. Sugar, water, and spices such as cinnamon or cardamom can be added. The flavor of Turkish coffee is so rich that only a small quantity is served. The growing interest in specialty coffees has spurred an interest in the types of coffee beans used at home for the regular brew. Once, only gourmands bought whole beans and ground them at home. Now, coffee grinders are considered routine kitchen accessories. Specialty coffee makers are also becoming more commonplace. DECAFFEINATING COFFEE BEANS Virtually all coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, a chemical stimulant that can increase heart rate and blood pressure and act as a diuretic and may have some addictive properties. There are several ways to remove the caffeine from coffee beans. One method uses a solvent to remove caffeine chemically. The beans are washed afterward to remove the solvent. Roasting also removes any traces. A second method is the Swiss water process, in which steam is used to heat the beans. Then, the outer layer of the beans, which contains most of the caffeine, is scraped off. The Sanka brand of coffee, introduced in the early part of the 20th century, was the first caffeine-free coffee devel- oped in the United States. Its name comes from the French term “sans caféine,” which means without caffeine",

Instant coffee (almost always made from robusta beans) is simply freshly brewed liquid coffee that has been dehydrated into a powder. Adding water to this powder rehydrates the coffee, thus resulting in a quick, if perhaps less flavorful, cup of coffee. Powder particles are processed to look more like traditional coffee grounds. Some instant coffee brands are freeze-dried. This means that the coffee solution was frozen to extract the water from it. The resulting product looks more like traditional coffee grounds and has a richer flavor. French press coffee maker French press coffee: mix fresh ground coffee and hot water; steep for 3 to 4 minutes. The lid has a screen that pushes the grounds to the bottom. At home, store coffee at room temper- ature and try to use it as soon as possible. If you use coffee from a can and it will be open for more than 2 weeks, place it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If the can will be open for more than 1 month, place the coffee in an airtight container in the freezer. Return the coffee to the refrig- erator or freezer immediately after mea- suring the amount you will use. Preparation Tips In addition to using fresh beans and grind- ing them just before brewing, other ways to improve the flavor of home-brewed coffee are the following: Start off with clean equipment—Oil residues from previous batches of coffee can cling to equipment and affect flavor— particularly if flavored coffee was used. Use fresh, cold water—Using hot water will result in flatter-tasting coffee. Also, make sure the water is free of miner- als or other chemicals. If you don’t like the taste of your tap water, consider using fil- tered or bottled water. Use the right amount of coffee—For traditional coffee-brewing machines, 1 tablespoon of coffee grounds is recom- mended for each 6 ounces of water. Adjust the amount of coffee grounds to your preference",

Don’t steep coffee grounds in the coffee too long—This extracts bitter sub- stances from the grounds that affect the taste of the coffee. Consider the filter—Paper filters may affect the texture of the coffee. Consider using a metal filter in your coffee maker instead. Metal filters are available for most types of machines. Avoid flavored coffees—Many of these coffees are made with lower-quality beans. Beverages 381 Tea Tea is said to be the universal beverage. Made from the leaves of an evergreen plant (related to the camellia flower) steeped in hot water, this beverage is a part of daily life from Great Britain to Morocco to China, where tea is thought to have origi- nated. Most of the leaves grown for the world’s tea are still grown in Asia, although some is produced in the United States. All types of teas are made from the leaves of the same plant, Camellia sinensis. Typically, finer teas use only the top leaf and bud; stronger, coarser brews use the leaves farther down on a branch. Tea leaves are typically dried after they are picked and then are broken into fragments, which bring forth the oils that give tea its flavor. Climate, soil, and processing give tea different tastes and characteristics. Instead of buying them, grind your own beans and add coffee flavorings of your own. Most coffee shops sell essences and flavorings just for this purpose. Serving Suggestions Coffee complements various foods and can be served by itself or mixed with other fla- vorings throughout the day. Coffees with cream or milk are typically considered morning coffees, and espresso is considered a beverage for later in the day. If you are a frequent coffee drinker, keep in mind that coffee is high in caffeine (up to 105 mil- ligrams per 6-ounce cup). In addition, specialty coffees can be high in calories or fat if made with cream or whole milk or flavorings such as chocolate. Use skim milk instead of whole milk in coffee drinks whenever possible",

Popular blended teas include English break- fast and Earl Grey. Herbal teas—Not made from tea leaves, herbal tea is a tea-like drink made by steep- ing herbs, flowers, and spices in heated water. Herbal tea has been made through- out history, often for medicinal purposes or simply to make water taste better. Popular herbal teas are made from chamomile, rose hips, and mint, to name just a few. In France, herbal teas are referred to as “tisanes.” Herbal teas typically contain no caffeine. Instant tea—Popular in the United States since the 1950s, instant tea is tea that has been dehydrated and granulated so that it dissolves rapidly in water. Often, it also contains sugar and other flavorings. Store tea away from heat in a sealed con- tainer. Tea keeps for about 6 months. After that, it loses its flavor and should be discarded. Preparation Tips The best tea is made using whole or large fragments of tea leaves, available in many specialty tea shops. Many of these shops also sell implements, such as mesh containers, which allow tea leaves to infuse their flavor into water without leaving the leaves behind. To make a good cup or pot of tea, start by using cold, fresh, and filtered water (if Oolong teas—Oolong tea has charac- teristics of both black and green teas.

The TEAS AND POSSIBLE HEALTH BENEFITS Tea has been consumed throughout history for its supposed curative powers, and medical research now suggests that there are health benefits from drinking green and black teas. Several studies show an association between consumption of green tea and reduction in the risk for cancer and heart disease. Green tea naturally contains chemical compounds called polyphenols. Within this family of compounds are chemicals that appear to play a role in cell growth and pro- grammed cell death, which could be important in preventing and control- ling cancer. Polyphenols also are antioxidants that can help prevent cell damage and may help prevent formation of plaque in the arteries. Soda Pop Once soda pop was the exception rather than the rule when it came to choosing a beverage. Now, it is virtually the default beverage for adults and children alike.

Instead, it is high in calories and, typically, sugar. One can of regular, nondiet soda pop has between 150 and 200 calories. It also has between 9 and 11 teaspoons of sugar and 30 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. These values are only part of the issue, however.

Phosphates in soda pop may cause the body to eliminate calcium during urination. There are also concerns about soda pop’s effect on tooth decay because of its high sugar content and some of the acidic chemicals within it. Preparation Tips and Serving Suggestions Soda pop has little if any role in a healthful diet. If you do decide to drink it, limit it as much as possible.

Wine Wine is the naturally fermented juice of grapes or other fruit, vegetables, or grains. It has been a beverage used at meals and celebrations for thousands of years. Today, there are vineyards and wineries throughout the world. General types of wine include the following: Red wines—Typically dry and full- bodied, common red wines are made from a variety of grapes, including cabernet sauvig- non, merlot, pinot noir, syrah, and sangiovese",

They also are made from various grapes, including chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, and riesling. Rosé or blush wines—These wines also vary in flavor from sweet to tart. These wines are made with red-skinned grapes but are processed in such a way that the juice’s contact with grape skins is limited. Sparkling wine—Sparkling is simply another way to say bubbly. Perhaps the best-known sparkling wine is champagne, although there are numerous other types. SPORTS DRINKS So-called sports drinks offer another beverage alternative, albeit one marketed mainly at athletes. The drinks contain mostly sugar, water, sodium, potassium, and flavorings. Whether they provide any additional benefit to athletes is debatable. For high-performance athletes, there may be some benefit from using these drinks because they replace sugar and sodium lost during extended periods of exercise. Water is still the preferred beverage for the average person and athlete. Plus, it has no calories or sugar, which most sports drinks do. WINE STORAGE It is not necessary to have a specially built wine cellar to store wine. Anywhere with a temperature from 45° to 65° Fahrenheit is acceptable, as long as the temperature does not fluctuate. The warmer the tempera- ture, the faster the wine will age. Cork-sealed wines should be stored on their sides to prevent the cork from drying. The flavor of sparkling wines ranges from slightly sweet to dry. They usually have a lighter flavor than traditional wines. Fortified wines—Brandy or other liquors may be added to sherry, port, or other dessert wines to increase alcohol in them. Aromatic wines—So-named because they are flavored with herbs or spices. Vermouth is an example of a flavored wine. Rice wine—Rice wine is a sweet, gold- en wine and usually has a low alcohol con- tent. It is produced by fermenting steamed rice. Sake and mirin are two well-known rice wines.

Whereas only a few regions of the world were thought to produce excellent wine decades ago, consumers now have an array of wines—not to mention prices—from which to choose. Wines from the tradi- tional winemaking areas of France remain excellent, of course, but they now have competition from wines produced in Germany, Italy, Spain, the United States, and Australia.

But after that, it is recommended that most white wines be drunk within 5 to 6 years. Many red wines improve with age. However, the extent of improvement depends largely on the quality of the wine. For less expensive varieties, age is not always a good thing. Wine does complement the flavor of a variety of foods. However, it also can be high in calories.

Vineyard Beer Beer is another alcoholic beverage that has been enjoyed through the ages. In fact, his- torians believe that brewing began shortly after humans started to cultivate grains. Over the centuries, brewing has evolved into a highly scientific process. Beer today generally contains about 5 percent alcohol and is brewed from malted barley and grains such as corn or rye and flavored with hops. Yeast also is used for fermentation. The quality of the water strongly influences beer’s flavor and char- acter because 90 percent of beer’s volume is water. The many varieties of beer include the following: 386 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Fruit beer—Fruit beers are mild beers with concentrated fruit juice added. A popular fruit beer in the United States is made with cranberries. Lager—This clear, golden brew is an American favorite. It is stored in casks until sediment and residues left from the brew- ing process settle out. The residue is then removed. Malt liquor—Despite the name, malt liquor is a beer, one that has a higher per- centage of alcohol (up to 9 percent) than other types of beer. In comparison, most beers have an alcohol content, by weight, from 5 to 8 percent. Pilsner, or pilsener—This is a pale, light lager beer that was originally brewed in Pilsen in the Czech Republic. The term is now used to describe most pale, mild- flavored lager beer. Porter—The addition of roasted malt gives this beer its dark color and strong flavor",

Stout—Another favorite of the pubs in England and Ireland, stout has a strong, bittersweet flavor and a dark-brown color. Roasted barley helps give this beer its character. Guinness is a well-known form of stout. Wheat beer—Sometimes known as “weitzen,” which is German for wheat beer, this type of beer has a pale-gold color and a mild flavor similar to that of a lager. It is made from malted wheat, which is why it is named wheat beer. Light beer—Largely an American creation, light beer has fewer calories than regular beer and less alcohol. Nonalcoholic forms of beer also are available. Unlike wine, beer is best soon after it is produced. Beer connoisseurs believe that beer older than 2 months should not be served. Beer manufacturers in the United Ale—Usually strongly flavored with a bitter taste, ale is popular in the pubs of England and Ireland. Its color ranges from light gold to amber.

But increasingly, studies are showing that light drinking (defined as 1 drink or less a day for women and 2 drinks or less a day for men) may have some health benefits. Perhaps the most significant benefit is in cardiovascular health. Alcohol may help increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (“good”) cholesterol and may help reduce the clotting that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Red wine also is thought to contain phytochemicals (compounds occurring in plants) that also may help protect against cardiovascular disease. Other studies suggest that light drinking may help protect against Alzheimer’s disease, senility, and macular degeneration, an eye condition that is the leading cause of blindness in people age 65 years or older. These benefits, however, are far from proved, and more study is needed to determine the role of light drinking in a healthful lifestyle. In addition, the potential benefits come with some substantial risks. Any alcohol is hazardous for a pregnant woman and her developing fetus. In addition, it is risky for anyone with a family history of alcohol addiction to use alcohol. Alcohol use has health risks for everyone else.

However, virtually all health experts agree that intake of these foods should be limited, and certain types (saturated and partially hydrogenated) should be avoided. This chapter provides information on the various types of fats, oils, and sweeteners and the foods that contain them. 389 Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners Fats & Oils Basics Fats, no matter what their source, play an important role in the food we eat. For cen- turies, every culture has taken advantage of the unique chemical properties of fats — for example, fats easily absorb other flavors. Fats also are used to cook foods, add a pleas- ing texture, impart tenderness to baked goods, and, in societies where food is scarce, increase the calorie content of a food. Fats, therefore, are a basic ingredient in cooking. The term “fats,” however, is broad, encompassing many different substances — from butter to lard to vegetable oil. All oils, for example, are fats. But not all fats I f there is any food group that we have a love-hate relationship with, it’s fats, oils, and sweeteners.

Sweeteners also satisfy a universal and natural craving. On the other hand, the pleasure that fats, oils, and sweeteners bring can come at a cost. These foods generally are high in calories, making it difficult for someone who eats a lot of them to maintain a healthful weight. They also have other health disadvantages. Too much of the wrong kinds of fats and oils can increase the blood cholesterol level, which in turn can increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Sugar and highly sweet- ened foods also are typically high in calories and provide few nutrients. For that reason, “empty calories” is a term often used to describe sweeteners or foods rich in them. Sugar and tooth decay are linked when sugar is eaten in excess and dental hygiene is poor. The Food Guide Pyramid recognizes both the advantages and the disadvantages of these foods. It does not eliminate them. But it does place them at the very tip of the pyramid. It’s okay to use these foods as long as they are eaten sparingly. Making sure fats, oils, and sweeteners play the proper role in your diet involves knowing more about them, their role in the diet, and what foods are rich in them. To help you do this, this chapter provides more detailed information on the types of fats, oils, and sweeteners you are likely to consume. are oils.

Oils can be made from various plants and seeds: vegetables, olives, rapeseed (from which canola oil is made), sunflower seeds, corn, peanuts, soybeans, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, safflower seeds, grape- seed, sesame seed, mustard seed, and coconuts are among the most commonly used. No matter what form they take, fats are made up of fatty acids, which are the molecular building blocks of fats in the same way that amino acids combine to form protein. At their most basic, fatty acids are molecular chains of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms. The differences in the chemical structure of fats make some better for you than others (see Chapter 2, Sorting Out the Fats, page 26). Sometimes a process called hydrogena- tion is used to make liquid oils solid at room temperature. This also converts unsatu- rated fat into trans fat. Trans fats are used in many processed and fast foods, such as doughnuts, crackers, chips, and french fries. Trans fats also give margarine its butter-like consistency. Trans fats tend to increase your cholesterol level and therefore should be 390 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods unrefined oils, you will likely appreciate the difference between these oils and their more highly processed counterparts. Storage The method of storage depends on whether a fat or oil is being stored. However, both become rancid given enough exposure to air, sunlight, and heat. Fats such as butter, margarine, and lard should be tightly wrapped and refrigerated. They usually can be stored this way for up to 2 weeks. Extra butter or margarine can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 years. Hydrogenated vegetable shortening can be stored, tightly covered, at room tempera- ture for as long as 3 months. Oils require a slightly different strategy. They should be stored in airtight containers that are opaque to prevent light from pen- etrating. Refrigeration is also generally recommended for oils",

An important guideline for evaluating the freshness of oil is to trust your nose. If the oil smells fishy or musty, discard it. The following sections provide more information on specific fats and oils. they add up to obesity, you are at increased risk for health problems. Selection Be discriminating in the type of fat you con- sume. Limit animal fat (saturated) and trans fats (hydrogenated oils). Instead, use small, sensible amounts of plant-based (monoun- saturated and polyunsaturated) fats. When purchasing products, always check the expiration dates. Rancidity is a concern with any type of fat. Purchasing oils, of which there are dozens of varieties, involves a close reading of the package label. Most cooks prefer to buy “cold pressed” oils, which means that minimal heat and pressure are used to extract the oil from the original plant or seed. This type of processing is considered important because it allows oil to maintain more of the plant’s natural flavors and tex- tures. With the exception of extra-virgin olive oil, however, it is difficult to find cold- pressed oils. A good alternative is to use so-called unrefined oils. Unrefined oils are extracted with heat. Unlike other oils, unrefined oils undergo minimal processing after this point. The result is a more flavorful oil and, sometimes, a more darkly colored oil. Unrefined oils generally include virgin olive oil and corn, nut, soybean, canola, and sesame oils. Unrefined oils break down eas- ily under heat and thus should not be used for deep-frying. Because deep-fried foods are not typically part of a healthful diet, you should not have to trade a flavorful oil for one with more cooking versatility",

Our bodies require small amounts of several fatty acids to build cell membranes and to support life-sustaining functions (see Chapter 2, Fat as a Nutrient, page 26). That said, the old adage about “too much of a good thing” is appropriate in discussing fat. Virtually all health experts agree that fat intake should be limited. The federal government, the American Heart Association, and other organizations recommend that fat intake for a healthy individual should be less than 30 percent of total daily calories. They also recommend that less than 8 to 10 percent of total calories come from saturated fat. Although various kinds of fat have dif- ferent effects on your blood cholesterol, all foods that are high in fat are high in calories. High-fat foods can easily increase your calories, making it difficult to main- tain a healthful weight. Fat packs more calorie punch than any other type of nutri- ent group. Per gram, fat has 9 calories (about 100 calories per tablespoon, or 250 calories per ounce). In contrast, protein and carbohydrates have just 4 calories per gram. Because of this, you do not need to eat very much fat before reaching the 30 percent threshold. If a low-fat diet is good, is an even lower-fat diet better? Not necessarily. Upper limits of fat intake have been estab- lished, but the same is not true for lower limits. Talk with your health care provider about the recommended fat intake that is best for you. Even a low-fat diet can lead to weight gain if you cut back on fat but take in excess calories by ignoring the rest of what you eat. Too many calories from any source result in added pounds",

Fats Butter Butter is made from the fat that comes from milk from cows, sheep, goats, horses, and other mammals. Most commercially pro- duced butter in the United States is made from cow’s milk. Butter making occurs in several stages. Cream that separates from milk is pasteur- ized (heated at a high temperature) to kill any organisms that might be harmful to human health. Then the cream is placed in a ripening tank for 12 to 15 hours. There, it goes through another series of heat treat- ments that give butter a crystalline struc- ture when it cools, helping it to solidify. The next step is to churn the butter. This process breaks down the fat globules in the cream. The result is that the fat is coagulated into butter grains. The mixture is then separated, the remaining butter paste is worked until it is smooth, and, depend- ing on the producer, it may be salted. Further variations in processing influence its characteristics, including aroma, taste, color, appearance, and quality. There are numerous butter variations. Those you find in gourmet markets include a French butter known as beurre (butter) de Charentes. Beurre de Charentes has an ivory color and tastes very rich. Another European-style butter growing in popular- ity in the United States is ripened butter, traditionally made in Denmark and the Netherlands, which is softer than regular butter. It also has a slightly tangy taste because lactic acid is added to the cream from which it is made. More common variations include the following: Whipped butter — Whipped butter’s name is self-explanatory.

Both light butter and whipped butter work well for toppings, but neither can be substituted for regular butter in recipes for baked goods because of the air or water they contain. Serving Suggestions Butter is one of the most versatile cooking ingredients and the foundation of numerous gourmet foods, sauces in particular. Its taste can be enhanced by mixing it with herbs and spices and then refrigerating it again. One popular flavored butter is garlic butter, which can be made by creaming the desired amount of butter and mashed garlic cloves to taste. Oregano, marjoram, basil, or parsley also can be added. Numerous recipes for flavored butter are available in cookbooks. Butter’s health drawbacks are well known, however, and thus it should be used selectively. If that special dish simply cannot be made without butter, don’t try to sub- into it. The result is that it is slightly lower in fat and calories than regular butter. It is very soft and spreadable. Light butter — Light butter usually has about half the calories of regular butter. It also generally has less fat and less salt because water is usually added to it. Unsalted butter — This is butter to which no salt has been added. Clarified butter — An ingredient in some recipes, clarified butter is butter that has the milk solids removed from it. The advantage is that it has a higher smoke point than regular butter, which increases its cooking versatility. It also keeps longer than butter and is thought to have a more pure flavor. Clarified butter is similar to a type of butter called ghee that is used in India. Butter should be refrigerated and stored in opaque packaging that prevents light from entering. In addition, the packaging should seal in moisture to prevent the butter from becoming dehydrated, a process that inten- sifies its color and detracts from its flavor",

An oil’s smoke point is simply the point at which fat, when heated, starts to smoke, smell acrid, and, as a result, give an unpleasant flavor to food. Each type of oil has a different smoke point. It is dependent on the free fatty acids that make up the oil. The higher the oil’s smoke point, the higher the tem- perature it can withstand. Safflower and canola oils have the highest smoke point and are the most ideal for frying or sautéing (435° to 450° Fahrenheit). Olive oil has a lower smoke point and is best used in salad dressings (extra virgin, 250° Fahrenheit) or in baking (regular olive oil, 410° Fahrenheit). Beyond the bad flavor imparted to foods, there are health reasons to avoid using an oil that has reached its smoke point. High temperatures can cause the oils to decompose, and this process, in turn, can irritate the lungs and cause gastroin- testinal upset. HOW TO “CLARIFY” BUTTER To make clarified butter, start by cutting unsalted butter into small pieces. Melt the butter over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. This allows the fat to separate from the milk solids. Then gently pour or spoon off the clarified butter fat and discard the solids. After the fat cools, it may appear to have a grainy texture. Clarified butter keeps longer than regular butter because the milk solids have been removed. It generally is used only for cooking because it has the advantage of having a higher smoke point than regular butter. Thus, it can be heated to higher temperatures, without burning, making it a good choice for frying or sautéing. healthier choice than harder “stick” mar- garines because the hydrogenation process used to make margarine hard adds trans fats to the product",

Liquid, whipped, or reduced-fat versions of this product burn easily or contain too much water or air for these purposes. Margarine should be stored in the refrigerator and can be frozen for several months. Serving Suggestions Hard or stick margarine is a good choice for pastries, helping to make crusts light and flaky. It can be used to replace butter in most recipes, although its flavor may not be as rich as that of butter. Like butter, this type of margarine has health drawbacks — it is high in calories and trans fats that are linked with heart disease — and should be used in moderation. Lard Lard is simply a name for pure animal fat that has been processed, including filter- ing, bleaching, hydrogenation, and emul- sification. Lard used in cooking is typically rendered from pork fat. Lard rendered from the fat around the pig’s kidney is considered the best lard to use. Lard is used worldwide in cooking, although it fell out of favor in the United States during the past several decades because of the amount of saturated fat in it. 392 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Reduced-fat or nonfat margarine — These products contain 25 to 65 percent less fat than regular margarine. To reduce fat lev- els, modified margarines and spreads are cre- ated with varying amounts of water and thickening agents, such as gelatin, rice starch, and guar gum.

It is specially blended so that it does not become too thick to squeeze out of the bottle. It is also handy for basting and for foods such as corn on the cob and waffles. Like butter, regular margarine is about 80 percent fat (actually, law requires this percentage of fat for the product to be labeled margarine) and has the same num- ber of calories. One tablespoon contains about 100 calories and 11 grams of fat. For years, margarine was thought to be a much healthier choice than butter because it contains less saturated fat than butter and no cholesterol (because it is not made from animal fat). Although that’s true, margarine is high in trans fats, which also are linked to cardiovascular disease. In addition, mar- garine is high in calories. Therefore, it should be used in moderation.

Preparation Tips Because lard is softer and oilier than butter and contains less water, some cooks believe it is the best choice for making pie crust. The reduced water content in lard helps make the crust especially light, flaky, and crumbly. Serving Suggestions Because lard is so high in saturated fat, it should be used sparingly at best. Vegetable Shortening Vegetable shortening, usually sold in coffee- can-sized canisters, is a solid fat made from vegetable oils. It gets its name from a property all fats have in common: they “shorten” gluten strands in flour-based products, which results in baked goods that have a tender texture. Although the base of shortening is oil, it has undergone a process known as hydro- genation to make the shortening solid at room temperature. Trans fatty acids are created by hydrogenation. This type of fat is associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease. Preparation Tips Plain and butter-flavored vegetable short- enings are sold in supermarkets.

Instead, the grassy-tasting oil is often sold at health stores as a supplement. The oil is more commonly used elsewhere in the world for cooking, particularly Eastern Europe. Flaxseed oil’s low saturated fat content means that it is more prone to rancidity than oils with higher saturated fat content. Therefore, it should always be stored in the refrigerator. Serving Suggestions Baking with flaxseed meal is one way to incorporate this healthful oil into your diet. Flaxseed meal is available in the health foods section of most supermarkets. Olive Oil If there is one oil that gourmands and nutri- tionists agree on, it is olive oil. Low in saturated fat and rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and flavor, olive oil is an excellent addition to any kitchen and meal. Sometimes it is even referred to as the “king of oils.” sautéing and frying — two cooking meth- ods that should be used in moderation.

Serving Suggestions Corn oil can have a strong flavor, which is why it is probably best used for cooking instead of serving “cold,” such as in a salad dressing. Corn oil’s stronger flavor works well in margarines, but many people prefer the taste of reduced-fat or light margarines made with corn oil. Cottonseed Oil Widely used at the turn of the century, cottonseed oil often is considered the orig- inal vegetable oil of the United States. Its fat is mostly polyunsaturated. Preparation Tips Cottonseed oil is used mainly as salad oil or in cooking. It is often used in processed foods because it is inexpensive. Serving Suggestions This oil has a neutral, clean taste that does not mask other flavors. It is used mainly by food manufacturers and is not common in home use. Flaxseed (Linseed) Oil The tall stems of the flax plant have many uses: they contain fibers that can be made into linen and high-grade paper. Oil also can be pressed from its shiny brown, oval- shaped seeds. Flaxseed is also sometimes known as linseed oil and is a common ingredient in paints, varnishes, and inks. This oil is low in saturated fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids, which may help protect against cardiovascular disease. Nearly 90 percent of coconut oil is satu- rated fat, topping even butter and lard in saturated fat content. Although its high saturated fat content makes coconut oil an unhealthful fat choice, it helps coconut oil resist rancidity. Coconut oil is a common ingredient in commercial baked goods, ice cream, and salad dressings. It is particularly common in non-dairy cof- fee creamers and whipped toppings. The whiff of coconut that arises from an open bottle of suntan lotion should also tell you that coconut oil has nonfood uses. Preparation Tips Coconut oil is popular in cuisine from Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and the West Indies",

Be aware that there is coconut oil in coconut cream and coconut milk. Serving Suggestions Because of its saturated fat content, coconut oil should be used sparingly. Corn Oil Corn oil is one of the most widely used cook- ing oils. It is pressed from the inside (endosperm) of corn kernels. It is more strongly flavored than other oils. Corn oil that has undergone less pro- cessing, known as unrefined corn oil, can be found in specialty stores. It is more dense than refined corn oil and has a darker gold color and a hint of popcorn flavor. Corn oil has a high level of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid and less saturated fat than many other oils. This is one reason it is used to make margarine. Preparation Tips Because of its high smoke point (410° Fahrenheit), corn oil is commonly used for One of the first oils to be made by humans, olive oil is pressed from olives that are picked when their color turns to pur- plish black and their skin develops an oily sheen. The rich flavor of olive oil varies according to where the olives are grown and the type of tree that produces them. For example, Spanish olive oil has a strong, some would say overwhelming, flavor. Oils produced from California olive trees are said to have a mild, almost sweet flavor. Olive oil from Italy, however, is usually con- sidered the best. U.S. consumers can find a wide range of olive oils in supermarkets and specialty shops. Unrefined olive oil, which is less processed, is considered the most flavorful and has a greenish cast. Fresh, refined olive oil should have a sweet, somewhat nutty flavor and a golden color. A rule of thumb is that the more deeply colored the oil, the more flavorful it will be. Olive oil is also graded by the International Olive Oil Council in these ways: Extra virgin — Considered the finest olive oil, extra virgin is made without heat or solvents, from the first pressing of the olives",

Virgin — Also made without heat or solvents, virgin olive oil also comes from the first pressing of the olives. It is more acidic but has a less intense flavor than extra virgin. It is widely used in cooking. Regular or pure — More subdued in flavor than virgin olive oil, regular (pure) olive oil is extracted with heat or solvent and may be made from pressed olives that have been washed and treated to extract more oil from them. This type of oil is often blended with virgin olive oil. Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners 395 Italian and Mediterranean cuisines take full advantage of olive oil’s robust flavor and health benefits. Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil Often thought to be the same thing, palm oil and palm kernel oil are actually two sep- arate oils. Palm oil, which is reddish brown, is extracted from the pulp of the fruit of the palm. Palm kernel oil, which is yellowish white and has a mild flavor, is extracted from the nut or kernel of the palm. Both, how- ever, have this in common: they are among the highest of all oils in saturated fat. Palm oil is often used in margarine and in commercially prepared gravies and soups. Light — Don’t be misled by the title — light olive oil has the same amount of calories and fat as regular olive oil. “Light” refers simply to color, fragrance, and flavor. Light olive oil also may be referred to as “mild.” Generally, this type of olive oil is dismissed by serious cooks. It does have the advantage of having the highest smoke point of all oils (468° Fahrenheit). Preparation Tips Generally, pressing and process- ing are done after the olives are collected in autumn. Shipments of freshly pressed olive oil begin arriving in specialty stores in the spring. Because most types of olive oil have a low smoke point, olive oil is not suited for deep- frying or sautéing.

Olives, avocados, peanuts, and the oils made from them are a source of monounsatu- rated fat. It is also commonly used as a medium to fry potato chips. Palm kernel oil has various uses, including in nondairy creamers, dress- ings, whipped creams and toppings, baked goods, and candy. Preparation Tips Palm kernel oil and palm oil are generally used only for commercial food production purposes. They are not typically sold in supermarkets or specialty stores. Serving Suggestions Persons following a healthful diet would do well to avoid both palm oil and palm kernel oil. Check the list of ingredients on 396 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods the products you buy. Avoid fatty prod- ucts that contain these oils. Skim milk is a far healthier option for a coffee lightener. Peanut Oil One of the first native North American sources of vegetable oil, the peanut is com- prised of about 50 percent oil. This oil is extracted by pressing steam-cooked peanuts. Peanut oil is high in monounsaturated fat and has the added advantage of having a relatively high smoke point (410° Fahrenheit). American peanut oils are often mild in flavor. Chinese peanut oils have a stronger peanut flavor because they are less processed. Peanut oil keeps well when stored in a cool, dark place. However, its shelf life is longer when it is refrigerated. Preparation Tips Peanut oil’s high smoke point makes it an excellent choice for deep-frying, a cooking technique always best used in moderation. Serving Suggestions A healthier use for peanut oil is to serve it as a salad dressing. It also adds a delicate flavor to mayonnaise recipes. The flavor of peanut oil also complements Indian and Asian cuisine. Safflower Oil Safflower oil is made from the seeds of the thistle-like safflower plant.

Serving Suggestions Almond oil or flavoring is used in numerous desserts and sweets, including the famous German holiday specialty marzipan. Almond oil may be used as a flavoring in dishes in which you would have used the nut itself. Grape-seed Oil This pale-yellow oil has both a taste and an aroma that reflect where it came from — it is extracted from the tiny grape seed. Often, these seeds are left over after wine- making. Grape-seed oil is produced mostly in France, Italy, and Switzerland, but it is easily found in the United States in both grocery and specialty stores. It is low in saturated fat and contains mostly polyunsaturated fat. Although light in consistency and color, grape-seed oil can have a relatively strong and distinctive taste. Preparation Tips Grape-seed oil’s high smoke point (445° Fahrenheit) makes it a good all-purpose oil for deep-frying. It can be used to gently sauté foods. Grape-seed oil does not become rancid quickly and can be stored at room temperature. Peanuts Sunflower seeds Preparation Tips Sunflower oil is considered an excellent all- around oil. Its very mild taste makes it extremely versatile for both cooking and seasoning, particularly when cooks do not want to mask the taste of other foods. Serving Suggestions Because sunflower oil is relatively inex- pensive and has little or no taste, it can be combined with more expensive specialty oils in foods such as salad dressings.

They have been sought throughout history for their pleasing taste and many uses. Just stop and think of what you have eaten today. This morning you may have sweet- ened your tea with honey and put maple syrup on your pancakes. At lunch, you may have eaten a snack food made with corn syrup — a form of sugar — and, perhaps, you finished off dinner with a cake made with the most commonly used and best known sweetener of all, granulated sugar. The science of sweetness, however, goes beyond the source of the foodstuff for the sweetener. At a molecular level, approxi- mately 100 chemicals are sweet. They all are referred to as sugars. Common ones you may have heard of include the following: Sucrose — Table sugar is the crystal- lized form of sucrose. Sucrose is referred to as a simple sugar. It is naturally occur- ring in all plants that depend on sunlight to produce energy. Sugar cane and sugar beets are among the most abundant pro- ducers of sucrose in the plant kingdom. Glucose — A simple sugar that plays many key roles in the body, glucose is a sim- ple sugar found in fruits, honey, cereal, flour, and nuts. Fructose — The sweetest of all sugars is found in abundance in honey and fruit. Lactose — Another simple sugar, lac- tose occurs only in milk. It is often added to other foods during processing to improve taste. Maltose — The result of a chemical processing that uses starch and malt, mal- tose has numerous commercial food uses. It is often used in beer, bread, and baby food, among other things. Pectin — A complex sugar, pectin is found in apples, citrus fruits, and some veg- etables. It is a form of fiber.

Generally, sweeteners often are referred to as having “empty calories.” They contain few or no vitamins, minerals, or other nutri- ents. And, because they are appealing, it can be easy to eat too much. This excess QUICK TIP Although refrigeration helps to prevent oils from becoming rancid, the colder temperature may result in some oils becoming cloudy or thicker. This change does not affect the oil’s nutritional value, quality, or taste. At room temperature, the oil will liquefy and, usually, clarify again. WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL OILS? Essential oils are extracted from vari- ous plants for use in perfumes, for aromatherapy purposes, or for use in medicines as flavorings. Common essential oils used for their scent include rose oil, geranium oil, and lavender oil. Essential oils used for flavorings are derived from lemons, cloves, peppermint leaves, and spearmint leaves. Walnuts extracted from the crushed cane or sliced beets is then processed to make sugar. Typically, the juice is boiled, and then chemicals are added to the solution to puri- fy it. The resulting syrup is known as molasses. Continued processing separates crystals from the molasses and other by- products. The crystals are then dried and packaged as sugar. The most common types of sugars found in supermarkets are as follows: Granulated white sugar — Often referred to as table sugar, this is the most commonly used type of sugar. There are different grades of granulated white sugar, and the size of the sugar crystal determines how it is used. Regular, extra-fine, or fine sugar is the sugar found most commonly in the sugar bowl and called for in most cookbook recipes. Superfine sugar or ultra- fine sugar has the smallest crystal size and is often used in cakes and meringues and to sweeten fruits or iced drinks. Superfine sugar dissolves the most easily in water",

It is simply white sugar crystals coated in a molasses syrup to add a natural mellow flavor and color. Dark brown sugar has more color and a stronger molasses flavor. Its fuller flavor is called for in recipes for gingerbread and baked beans. Lighter types are usually used in baking. Neither type of brown sugar is considered raw sugar, although they do look similar to it. Confectioners’ sugar — Also known as powdered sugar, this is granulated sugar that has been ground into a powder. A small amount of cornstarch can be added to prevent clumping. Confectioners’ sugar typically is used to make icing, in whipping cream, and as a topping for desserts. Decorating or coarse sugar — Also called sugar crystals, decorating sugar has granules about four times larger than those 400 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods Sugar Sugar was once considered as valuable as gold because of its scarcity. Its use spread throughout the Western world after explorers, then armies, conquered parts of ancient Arabia. In early times, it was sold and traded in blocks, which were then ground into powder. Although sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in every fruit and veg- etable, it is found in the greatest quantities as sucrose in sugar cane, which is grown in the tropics, and sugar beets, which can be cultivated in colder climates. Juice could make it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. Heavy use of sweeteners also may increase the risk of tooth decay, which is why it is important to brush after eating a sweet food, particularly one that is sticky, such as caramel. For these reasons, it is best to minimize the amount of sweeteners in your diet. Selection and Storage These factors depend on the type of sweet- ener.

Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners 401 Honey In ancient times, this thick, sweet, golden liquid was thought of as a healing agent, a gift from the gods, and a symbol of wealth. Today, this sweetener is still revered, although not as highly, for being a natural source of sweet flavor. Honey is made by bees. The basic ingredient is nectar gathered from flowers. Enzymes in the bee’s saliva convert the nectar into honey. Essentially, this is a simple matter of chemistry, in which the sugar (sucrose) in nectar is converted into fructose and glucose. As the phrase “busy as a bee” suggests, bees work hard to make honey. The bee must make up to 100,000 round trips from minimize its role in our diet. Make a little go a long way. To do so: • Add spices, such as cinnamon or nut- meg, to foods to jazz up flavor while reduc- ing sweeteners used in them. • Add fruit or yogurt to foods such as cereal, instead of a sweetener. • Avoid sweetened soft drinks, and minimize fruit juices with added sugar. Better yet, drink water. • Check labels for sugar or any one of the chemical names for it: glucose, sucrose, lactose, or fructose, to name just a few. Also, watch for corn syrup or malt syrup, two more widely used sweeteners in food manufacturing. Serving Suggestions Manufacturers can reduce the fat in many foods, but it is hard to do without sugar. Sugar is a key component of baked goods and desserts and is used to enhance the flavor of everything from sweet-and-sour stir-fry to ham. The amount of sugar used in a recipe often can be reduced by up to half without compromising the flavor. However, this is not always the case, so a bit of trial and error is required. of regular granulated sugar.

Fruit sugar — Slightly finer than “regular” sugar, fruit sugar is used in dry mixes such as gelatin desserts, pudding mixes, and drink mixes. The more uni- form crystals prevent separation or settling of smaller crystals to the bottom of the box. In addition to sweetening items, sugar plays an important role in making food. It is a critical ingredient in bread, in which it provides food for yeast and thus helps bread to rise. It also adds to the flavor and crust color of baked goods and helps extend shelf life. In large amounts, sugar inhibits the growth of yeast and molds in jams and jellies. Sugar syrups protect frozen and canned foods from browning and wither- ing. In ice cream, beverages, baked goods, and other products, sugar adds bulk, texture, and body. It is also used in many condiments, such as ketchup and salad dressing, where it blends flavors, reduces acidity, and helps create a smooth texture. Sugar has a long shelf life. Kept tightly wrapped and in a cool, dark place, it will keep for months or even years. Preparation Tips Sugar adds flavor and calories but little else. Therefore, it is best for most of us to SUGAR IN THE RAW Many so-called raw sugars are marketed in the United States. Two popular types of raw sugar are the coarse-textured dry Demerara sugar, which is produced in the South American country of Guyana, and the moist, fine-textured muscovado, or Barbados, sugar. Demerara sugar is light brown and is characterized by large golden crystals that are slightly sticky. It is excellent as a topping for hot cereals and is widely used in specialty coffee houses. Muscovado, or Barbados, sugar is a dark, rich brown sugar and retains a strong molasses flavor. Turbinado sugar is another variation of raw sugar",

    "content": "This clear, subtly flavored syrup is sweeter than sugar and has a distinctive flavor. Molasses — Molasses, a dark viscous syrup, is a by-product of the sugar-making process and is generally used for flavoring foods or as a glaze. It is poured over foods as a condiment in some regions of the United States. Light molasses is produced during the first stages of the sugar-extraction process. Dark molasses is made during the second stage and is referred to as unsulfured molasses. Blackstrap molasses, made during the final stage of sugar production, is darkly colored and has an intense flavor. Black treacle — Black treacle is a thick, black, and sticky syrup. It is very similar to molasses and is a by-product of the sugar-production process. Black trea- cle is sweeter than molasses. A lighter- colored and lighter-flavored form is also available. Both are more common in England. Palm syrup — This dark, thick, and intensely flavored syrup is made from palms. It is an ingredient in some Asian other sweeteners, does contain trace amounts of vitamins and minerals. If kept in a sealed container and a cool dark place, honey can be kept for a long time. Cooler temperatures, such as in a refrigerator, may cause honey to thicken. Warming it up, however, restores honey’s appearance. Its taste is not altered. However, very warm temperatures can change honey’s flavor. Preparation Tips Most honey sold in stores is pasteurized, filtered, and blended. Some cooks buy honey directly from an apiary because they believe that these processes alter or dull honey’s delicate flavor. Honey also can be used as a substitute for sugar (about 1/2 cup honey for 1 cup of sugar) in many recipes. Keep in mind, however, that honey may cause food to brown more quickly. In addition, you will need to reduce the liquid in the recipe. Serving Suggestions Honey adds moisture to cakes, breads, and other confections. It is also an excellent topping for most baked goods. One other common use is as a glaze for meats such as ham",

The most common types include the following: Cane syrup — Thick and extremely sweet, cane syrup is made from sugar cane. It is a common ingredient in Caribbean and Creole recipes. Grain syrups — Sweet syrups can be made from several grains: barley, wheat, corn, or rice. They are not as sweet as sugar a distinctive taste that cannot be duplicated, chocolate is the universal favorite when it comes to flavor. In fact, ancient cultures even thought it was a gift from the gods, one with medicinal properties. It is perhaps the most popular sweet flavoring worldwide. Chocolate is made from the beans of the cacao tree, which grows in the warm, humid weather of the equatorial regions. Like coffee beans, the beans of the cacao tree must be dried, chopped, and roasted Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners 403 before use. The processing of the beans results in a dark brown liquid called choco- late liquor. This fluid — which is 55 percent fat, 17 percent carbohydrate, and 11 per- cent protein — is used to make virtually all types of chocolate. Different types of chocolate contain vary- ing amounts of cocoa butter — a vegetable fat derived from the cacao bean — and solids from the cacao bean. Chocolate types include the following: HONEY AND INFANTS Many parents are unaware that honey should not be served to children younger than 1 year because it may contain a small amount of botulism toxin. The amount of this toxin in honey is not enough to harm adults and children older than 1 year because their immune systems have matured. But in infants, this toxin can be life-threatening. recipes and usually is sold only at specialty markets. Preparation Tips Most grain syrups are used commercially. In contrast, maple syrup is typically used at home. Pure maple syrup is found in super- markets",

    "content": "In contrast, maple syrup is typically used at home. Pure maple syrup is found in super- markets. However, pancake syrups com- monly contain either a small portion of maple syrup or maple flavoring that is then mixed with a grain syrup. Many types of syrups are used to make candy. Keep in mind that syrups high in sugar have a higher boiling point than water. Serving Suggestions Maple syrup is typically used as a topping for waffles and pancakes. Numerous types of syrups can be used as glazes for meats (ham, in particular, and also poultry or fish) or on top of vegetables, such as carrots. Molasses also makes an excellent glaze. Sugar syrups make an excellent glaze for pound cakes and bundt cakes. Chocolate If there is one flavoring that everyone seems to love, it’s chocolate. Rich and sweet, with Unsweetened — Sometimes referred to as baker’s chocolate, this dark, rich, and bitter chocolate does not have any sugar added to it. It is usually added to recipes in which sugar is an ingredient. Bittersweet — This dark, rich choco- late is comprised mostly of chocolate liquor, meaning it is rich in cacao solids, but it may have some milk solids and other flavorings added to it. Semisweet — A favorite of makers of chocolate chip cookies, semisweet choco- late contains more milk solids and other flavorings than bittersweet chocolate. Milk — The sweetest of all chocolates, milk chocolate has a light-brown color and a mild chocolate flavor. White — This ivory-colored chocolate contains no cacao bean solids, but it does contain cocoa butter, which gives it a rich, creamy mouth-feel. It differs from white almond bark or candy coating, which uses vegetable fat as a base instead of cocoa butter. 404 Part II: Encyclopedia of Foods all cocoa butter has been removed from it. A tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder contains about 15 calories and just under 1 gram of fat. Cocoa typically is not sweetened and is added to recipes in which sugar is used",

    "content": "Cocoa typically is not sweetened and is added to recipes in which sugar is used. There are two main types of cocoa: natural and “Dutch-process.” Natural cocoa is light in color and has a strong chocolate flavor. In contrast, Dutch-process has a milder taste but is darker in color. Chocolate’s nutritional value varies. One ounce of unsweetened chocolate has 145 calories, 16 grams of fat, and 9 grams of saturated fat. In comparison, an ounce of semisweet chocolate has 135 calories, 9 grams of fat, and 5 grams of saturated fat. Chocolate also is a source of protein and contains trace amounts of vitamins and some minerals, such as potassium. Chocolate should be stored in a cool, dark place and can be kept for several Imitation chocolate — Typically used in baking chips, imitation chocolate replaces some or all of the cocoa fat with other veg- etable fats. It is high in fat (mostly saturated fat) and does contain caffeine. Cocoa is another common type of chocolate. It is a powdered form of choco- late made from chocolate liquor. However, WHAT IS LIQUID SUGAR? Liquid sugars were first developed before processing made distribution of granulated sugars practical. It is generally used for commercial purposes in products in which dis- solved granulated sugar is desired. A darker liquid sugar is also available. It is called amber liquid and is darker and has more of a cane sugar flavor. Invert sugar is another type of liquid sugar. It helps prevent sugar crystallization and also helps the product it is in retain moisture. Invert sugar is sweeter than regular table sugar and is generally available only for commercial uses. Made from maple syrup, maple sugar is twice as sweet as regular table sugar. ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS Aspartame (better known as Nutra- Sweet), acesulfame-K, saccharin, and sucralose are synthetic substances that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They are used commercially and in the home to sweeten products",

For more information, see Chapter 2, page 21. months. Dark chocolate can be stored for up to a year. Varying temperatures will cause lighter, whitish areas to appear on chocolate — something that does not affect taste and is resolved when the chocolate is melted. Chocolate also can be frozen, but it must be wrapped tightly to prevent moisture from damaging the chocolate when it is thawed. Preparation Tips Cocoa can be used as a substitute for choco- late in recipes. However, when this sub- stitution is made, fat needs to be added to the cocoa to ensure that the final product will be moist. Each square of unsweetened Fats, Oils, & Sweeteners 405 chocolate can be replaced with 3 table- spoons of cocoa and 1 tablespoon of cook- ing oil. Melting chocolate is difficult because it burns easily. For that reason, it is best to use a double boiler to melt chocolate. Avoid splashing any water into the melting choco- late because doing so can cause the choco- late to become hard and thus unusable. Chopping the chocolate into small bits before melting it helps achieve the smooth, even consistency that many recipes require. Always look at the ingredient list of the chocolate you buy to ensure that you are not getting a substitute. Serving Suggestions Chocolate is the classic dessert ingredient, providing the flavoring power for cakes, tortes, frostings, mousses, creams, and other sweets too numerous to count. Chocolate’s high fat content and high calories mean it should be used in moderation. Use chocolate as an accent to a healthier food — such as a dip for strawberries — rather than as the main ingredient. Reduced-calorie hot cocoa mixes are an excellent way to feed a chocolate craving without the fat and calories. Or, simply save chocolate for special occasions",

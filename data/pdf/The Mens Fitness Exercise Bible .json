    "text": "01   THE MEN’S FITNESS\nFOOD PYRAMID\nRemember the USDA Food Pyramid? The one that was\nposted by the lunch line in your grade school cafeteria and\ntaught in health class? The government’s official position\non how you should eat to be fit and healthy included\nrecommendations to consume up to 11 servings of pasta,\nbread, and crackers per day; limit meat and eggs to three\nservings; and count potatoes as a vegetable.\nYeah, don’t eat like that.\nThe Food Pyramid was so misleading and inaccurate that\nin 2011 it was replaced with the USDA’s MyPlate, an\nimproved but still flawed approach to fighting obesity. To\nbe fair, the government’s nutrition advice is aimed at the\naverage American who desires to be in only average shape\n(read: not obese). As we assume you picked up this book\nto be bigger, stronger, more ripped, and healthier than\nthat, you need an entirely different approach.\nTo that end, we’ve created the Men’s Fitness Food\nPyramid—an easy visual guide to eating for physique\nenhancement, performance, and optimal health. See how\nthe pyramid works below and then use it to build a better\nbody.\nHIT YOUR NUMBERS\nAs a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms\nof macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat\ngets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of\nprotein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by\nmultiplying the numbers in the Men’s Fitness Food\nPyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these\nnumbers and you’ll hit your goals.\nWith that said, your nutrition doesn’t need to be as\nprecise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You’ll do\njust fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat\n(which we’ll show you how to do) and keeping a general\ntally.\nMAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY\nThe calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are\njust a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the\nproper amounts for his own body. If you’re not losing\nweight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try\nexperimenting with bumping up your protein and fat\nintake a bit. If you feel as if you can’t gain weight, you can\nadd more carbs and even more fat, which will increase\nyour calories sharply. For any formulation you make, give\nit at least a week to take effect before you make any\nchanges.\nThe Men’s Fitness Food Py ramid was created with cooperation from the\nMen’s Fitness Nutrition A dv isory  Board. It includes John Meadows, C .S.S.N.;\nNate Miy aki, C .S.S.N.; C hris Mohr, Ph.D.; and Shelby  Starnes.\nThe Men’s Fitness Food Py ramid was created with cooperation from the\nMen’s Fitness Nutrition A dv isory  Board. It includes John Meadows, C .S.S.N.;\nNate Miy aki, C .S.S.N.; C hris Mohr, Ph.D.; and Shelby  Starnes.\nPROTEIN\nWith protein being the main component of muscle tissue,\nyour intake of it must remain high no matter your goal. To\nmake size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per\npound of your body weight to support optimal growth.\nWhen dieting, you must create a caloric deficit—but that\ncan cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do\nit. That’s why we increase protein intake and decrease\nstarchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein\nto as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but\nstart lower and increase gradually as you reduce your\ncalories slowly. If you feel like you’re not recovering from\ntraining or you’re losing muscle, up the protein fast.\nThe best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean\nbeef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder.\nA three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the\nsize and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains\n20–25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and\nzero carbs.\nCARBS\nAll carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your\nblood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a\nresult, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus\nsugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels.\nResearch, including a study at the University of\nWashington School of Medicine, has found that exercise—\nparticularly strength training—increases insulin sensitivity\nin the muscles. So if you’ve just worked out, more of the\ncarbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly\nto your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes\nfor protein too, which is why it’s helpful to consume a\nmixture of protein and carbs after training—we’ll discuss\nthis more later.) On the other hand, if you’ve been sitting\non the couch watching football, those carbs will just get\nstored around your waist.\nFor this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs\ncome before, during, and shortly after training. It also\nmeans that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to\nget lean—you need to keep insulin levels low. “If someone\nis in fat-loss mode,” says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a\nnutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, “I like to\nlimit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when\nthey’ll go where you want them”—that is, to muscle tissue.\nFor muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes\nincluded) to meals around training time first, before\nadding them to other meals.\nCarb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats,\nfruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their\nwhole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily\n(excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green\nvegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat\none gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight\nwhen dieting and two grams per pound when you want to\nput on muscle.\nA fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about\none cup and gives you 40–45 grams of carbs and\nnegligible protein and fat.\nFAT\n“We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for\nhormone production,” says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a\nnutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco,\nCA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind,\nhelps in the creation of testosterone, which does\neverything from getting you big and lean to keeping your\n“little friend” ready to say hello. Contrary to popular\nopinion, when dieting, you don’t need to drop your fat\nintake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when\ncarbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as\nwell as a good source of energy.\nMost of your fats should come by way of your protein\nfoods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of\noil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well.\nAim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to\nstart. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat,\nand one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat.\nTwo tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your\nthumb and contains 15–20 grams of fat.\nWORKOUT NUTRITION\nResearch hasn’t yet clarified the optimal amount of\nprotein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the\nmaximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than\nnone, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in\nthe European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male\nsubjects one of the following to consume after weight\ntraining: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of\namino acids (components of protein), a combination of\nboth, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos\nshake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the\nother groups, which the researchers presumed was\nbecause the concoction did the most to reduce muscle\nprotein breakdown after training.\nMeadows recommends taking in 25–50 grams of\nprotein, 25–35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before\ntraining. Afterward, consume another 20–40 grams of\nprotein and 40–80 grams of carbs—you can begin\nchugging this shake during the workout as well to limit\nmuscle breakdown even further, though this may not be\nnecessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make\nshakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein\nsource, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for\ncarbs.\nIf powders and shakes aren’t in your budget, Miyaki says\nyou can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout.\nOne or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt\nmuscle breakdown. And a lean three-ounce slice of\nprotein to accompany it is fine.\nA PERFECT DAY\nHow to plan your eating to achieve\nyour goals\nLet’s say\nyou’re a\n180\nPOUND\nMAN\nwho\nwants to\nlose\nhis gut.\nYou could\nstart\nyour diet\neating about\n2,100\nCALORIES\nDAILY\n(180 × 12)\nconsisting of\n180g\nPROTEIN,\n180g\nCARBS,\nand\n70g\nFAT.\nHERE’S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS\nGUY’S BUSY SCHEDULE.\nBREAKFAST\n8 oz black coffee\n3 scrambled eggs\n1/3 cup unsweetened oatmeal with cinnamon\nPOST-WORKOUT\n25g whey protein\n1 banana\nLUNCH\n3 oz grilled salmon\nLarge raw salad w/ 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar\n1 cup sweet potato or white potato (cooked)\nDINNER\n6 oz baked chicken breast\n1 cup jasmine rice or potato (cooked)\nSteamed broccoli\nSNACK\nMeal-replacement shake with 50g protein, 25g carbs, 5g\nfat\nDESSERT\n2 tbsp almond butter mixed with one scoop chocolate\ncasein protein\nand water (to make a pudding)\n \n02   HOW TO WARM UP\nWe’ll keep this brief. When you’re eager to work out, the\nlast thing you want to do is slow your roll with a long\nwarmup that has you flopping around the floor like a fish,\ndraining your momentum. If you passed fifth grade P.E.,\nyou’ve already had it drilled into you that warming up is\ncrucial and not to be skipped, so we’ll spare you the\nspeech about howimportant it is. Instead of lecturing,\nwe’ll give you some warmup options that get you\nsweating and ready to perform any of the workouts that\nfollow, but also fit into the time you have and your level of\npatience—whatever the case may be. Most important is\nthat you don’t start lifting heavy weights, jumping, or\nrunning totally cold, which common sense should tell you\nis an injury waiting to happen.\nA)\nB)\nOPTION 1 THE BEST\nWARMUP\nIf you have at least an hour in which to train, or a history\nof injuries that could otherwise impede your ability to\ntrain safely, your warmup should begin with foam rolling\nand include a wide array of dynamic exercises and static\nstretches.\nIf you’ve tried a foam roller after a tough workout,\nyou were instantly aware of its ability to help relieve\nmuscle aches and soreness. It also provides an easy way\nto start getting warmed up, as it promotes blood flow.\nRest your muscles on the roller (a tennis ball, softball, or\nlacrosse ball work, too) and roll them out for about 30\nseconds each. When you find a tender spot, hold the\nposition until you feel it begin to release (or for as long as\nyou can stand it). Pay extra attention to the hips, glutes,\nouter and inner thighs, lower back, calves, and lats. You\ncan repeat the rolling after your workout as well if you\nlike, as this may enhance recovery.\nPerform some light activity that elevates your heart\nrate and makes you feel warm (though not necessarily\nfuzzy). This could be a set of 30 jumping jacks, a five-\nminute walk on the treadmill (set to a slight incline), or a\nC)\nminute or two of jumping rope. Other cardio machines like\na stationary bike or an elliptical machine can also get your\nblood flowing.\nNow you’ll begin what’s often called a dynamic\nwarmup. In addition to encouraging further blood\nflow and higher body temperature, dynamic exercises take\nyour muscles through the ranges of motion you’ll use in\nyour workout, preparing you to get into those positions\nsafely. There are endless options, but try this routine.\n1 SHOULDER OVER AND BACK\nPERFORM 15 REPS\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar in front of your\nhips with hands outside shoulder width. Keeping your\nelbows straight, raise your arms overhead and behind your\nbody as far as you can. Bring them back in front of you\nagain. Continue going over and back and gradually narrow\nyour grip as you feel your shoulders loosen up.\n2 HIP HINGE\nPERFORM 15 REPS\nPlace your hands on your hips and stand with feet hip\nwidth. Push your hips back, bending your knees only as\nneeded, until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.\nSqueeze your glutes as you forcefully push your hips\nforward again to stand up straight.\n3 OVERHEAD SQUAT\nPERFORM 10 REPS\nHold a band, dowel, yardstick, or light bar overhead with\nhands outside shoulder width. Stand with feet shoulder\nwidth and toes turned out slightly. Bend your hips back\nand squat as low as you can without letting your tailbone\ntuck under. Keep the object you’re holding above and\nslightly behind your head the whole time—don’t let it drift\nin front of you.\n4 SIDE LUNGE\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EACH LEG\nStand with feet hip width and step out to your left.\nLower your body until your left knee is bent 90 degrees,\nor until you feel a stretch in the right side of your groin,\nbut keep your right leg straight. Repeat on the right side.\n5 BENTOVER YTW\nPERFORM 8 REPS OF EACH\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend your hips back,\nkeeping your lower back flat, until your torso is about 45\ndegrees to the floor. Let your arms hang. Now squeeze\nyour shoulder blades together and raise your arms up and\nout to your sides about 45 degrees to form a Y shape.\nLower them and then raise them out to your sides 90\ndegrees to form a T.\nLower and then raise them out to your sides, but bend\nyour elbows 90 degrees to form a W.\n6 CAT/CAMEL\nPERFORM 10 REPS\nKneel on the floor with knees under your hips and hands\nbeneath your shoulders. Arch your back so your chest\nrises—you should look like a cat stretching. Now round\nyour entire back so it looks like a camel’s hump.\n7 BIRD DOG\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EACH SIDE\nFrom the kneeling position, extend your left hand out in\nfront of you. Simultaneously kick your right leg back\nstraight, bracing your core and squeezing your glutes as\nyou do so. Hold for a moment and then switch legs.\n8 HIP CIRCLE\nMAKE 10 CLOCKWISE CIRCLES AND THEN SWITCH LEGS; REPEAT\nON BOTH LEGS IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION\nFrom the kneeling position, raise your right knee off the\nfloor and make circles with it, opening your hip as much as\npossible on each revolution. Keep your shoulders square\nto the floor.\n9 GROINER\nPERFORM 10 REPS ON EACH SIDE\nGet into pushup position with your hands shoulder width,\nfeet close together, and body in a straight line. Jump\nyour left foot forward and land it to the outside of your\nleft hand. Let your hips sink a bit to feel the stretch and\nthen reverse it—jump your left foot back while the right\none comes up to your right hand.\nD)\nAt this point, it’s wise to statically stretch muscles\nthat you know to be chronically tight. For most\npeople, the hips, glutes, and lats are bound up due to\nmany hours sitting at desks in front of computers, but\nstretch whatever areas you feel need it most. Hold each\nstretch for 30 seconds and repeat for three sets on each\nside. The following are some suggestions.\nHIP FLEXOR STRETCH\nGet into lunge position on the floor with your right leg\nback. Place your hands on your hips and push your hips\nforward until you feel a stretch in your right hip. Squeeze\nyour glutes on your right side. For a more intense stretch,\nreach your right arm overhead and lean back slightly while\nkeeping your hips forward. Another progression is to\nreach back and grasp the outside of your rear foot and\ngently pull it off the floor. You’ll feel the stretch go into\nthe top of your thigh.\nLAT STRETCH\nGrasp a sturdy upright object with your left hand, thumb\nfacing up, and bend your hips back until your torso and\narm are in line and you feel a stretch in your lat. Move\ngently from side to side so you stretch the entire muscle.\nPEC STRETCH\nPlace the meat of your right forearm against a sturdy\nupright object (a doorframe is perfect) and bend your\nelbow 90 degrees. Gently lean forward so you feel a\nstretch on your pec.\nPIRIFORMIS STRETCH\nSit on a bench and cross your left leg over your right\nknee, bending your left knee 90 degrees. Gently push\nyour left knee down so you feel a stretch on the outside\nof your left glutes.\nCALF STRETCH\nPlace your hands against a wall and stagger your feet so\none is close to the wall and your rear leg is straight. Both\nfeet face forward and your rear leg should be aligned with\nyour upper body. Lean forward until you feel your calf\nstretch on your trailing leg.\nOPTION 2\nTHE MEATHEAD’S\nWARMUP\nMost guys come into the gym and grasp the bar or a pair\nof dumbbells and do a light set of 15–20 reps. Then they\ngo a little heavier and cut the reps down a bit. They’ll do\none more set and, now that they’re sweating, figure they’re\nready to go.\nWhile this is hardly the best way to prep your body, it\ndoes serve the purpose most of the time, assuming you’re\nnot training too heavy. But take it a little slower and more\ndeliberately, and you’ve got a more decent warmup\nroutine for when you’re doing one of our lifting workouts\nand need to get done in a hurry.\nHere’s how to warm up for a heavy strength workout\nthat begins with a barbell exercise. More accurately, this\nis called “working up” in powerlifting circles, because the\ngoal is to gradually work your way up to using the\nheaviest weights possible. You start with the empty bar\nand perform 10–15 reps with perfect form and then add\nweight in moderate increments until you’re at the\nmaximum load you plan to lift on the exercise.\nHere’s how it might look for a guy working up to a 275-pound squat\nfor five reps:\nThere’s no exact formula for how to do this, so the\nweights and reps above aren’t mandatory, but the idea is\nto start very light, pump some blood into the working\nmuscles and lubricate the joints, and then add weight\nsteadily until you comfortably arrive at the heaviest load\nyou can use for the target reps. The reps on these work-up\nsets are kept low (after the first set or two) because you\nneed to conserve energy for the main effort, the work set.\nThese sets also serve to reinforce good technique, so the\nform on the exercise is fresh in your mind and the body is\nin its groove to do it properly when you get to a\nchallenging load.\nHow long should you rest between sets? Since work-up\nsets aren’t as taxing as your main work sets, you shouldn’t\nneed to rest long. A minute or so will be fine for most\nuntil you get up to heavy weights, at which time you can\nrest longer.\nThere are a few tricks you can employ to make this\nprocess even more effective and make your top set even\nheavier, or at least feel easier. Try doing your last work-up\nset a little heavier than the main set, but only for one or\ntwo reps, so it’s not too strenuous. Then back down to the\nweight you intend to use for the work set.\nFor instance, if you’re going to perform a squat with 275 for five, your\nlast four sets could look like this:\nIn other words, you gradually work up to an even\nheavier weight, reducing your reps to minimize fatigue,\nand then go back down to 275. The set with 300 might be\nway more than you can handle for five reps, but done for\nonly one, it will feel relatively easy. By comparison, 275\nwill feel much easier when it’s done afterward. Obviously,\nthis won’t work on super-heavy sets when your target reps\nare in the 1–3 range, but it’s great when they’re between 4\nand 8.\nAnother trick, which we learned from Jason Ferruggia, a\nstrength coach in Los Angeles, CA, is to back the weight\ndown for a set before you reach your target. This works\nwell if you’re trying to hit a new max (one rep), which\ncan be very intimidating. The weight tends to feel very\nheavy at around 90 percent of your max, and it can\ndissuade you from going any heavier. By going a bit\nlighter for a set and then working your way back up, you\ngive your nervous system more time to adapt. The weight\nfeels lighter, so you feel more confident, and the rest of\nthe way up to your max weight goes smoother.\nSay you’re trying to bench press 315 for the first time. Your last few sets\ncould develop like this:\nTo be clear, working up is not optional. Because it can\nbe time consuming, if you have time for only one kind of\nwarmup, this should be it. But we strongly suggest that,\nwhenever possible, you employ one of the other options\nwe list here beforehand.\nIncidentally, working up applies to training with\nkettlebells/dumbbells, a suspension trainer, and bands as\nwell. Start with light resistance, gradually tapering your\nreps as you up the intensity.\nOPTION 3\nTHE PRACTICAL WARMUP\nAs the name implies, this routine is for when you have\ntime to warm up, but not enough to do everything listed\nin Option 1. In this case, you need to get a good sweat\ngoing and prepare your muscles and joints to move while\ndoing the bare essentials.\nAccording to Ben Bruno, a celebrity trainer at Rise\nMovement in West Hollywood, CA, you should hit a\ncardio machine for five minutes followed by these\nstretches. “Do toe-touch squats and sumo squat holds\n(both of which are explained below) to improve\nmobility,” Bruno says.\nTOE-TOUCH SQUAT\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly\nout. Reach down to touch your toes with legs extended\nand then bend your hips back to squat down, keeping\nyour lower back in its natural arch. Now reach your hands\noverhead and come up.\nSUMO SQUAT HOLD\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly\nout. Bend your hips back and squat down, keeping your\nlower back flat and reaching your hands to your toes in\nthe bottom position. Hold the position for a few seconds\nand then use your elbows to push your knees farther\napart so you can sink deeper into the squat.\nDID WE SAY THIS WOULD BE BRIEF?\nIn a nutshell, that’s all you need to know about warming\nup. Note that even if you’re doing a lower-body workout,\nit’s smart to include some upper-body warmup moves\nbecause the entire body is connected. Tightness or\ncoldness in the upper torso can lead to injury when\nworking the legs, and vice versa; so while you may\nabbreviate or recombine the warmup moves listed here,\ndon’t ignore whole muscle areas just because you’re not\ntraining them that day. For the cardio routines beginning\nin chapter 26, you don’t need to do any more warming up\nthan what is already built into the workouts.\n \n03   FULL GYM\nWe all love to bitch about our gyms. They don’t have\nenough benches, the machines are always broken, and so\non. It’s only when we’re forced to train at home or in a\nhotel that we realize what a luxury even the most average\ncommercial fitness center is.\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a membership to a\ntraining facility, this chapter is for you. Or, if you’ve put\ntogether a well-stocked home gym, this is where you\nshould start as well. While it may not be the fitness\nparadise you crave, it almost certainly has all the tools you\nneed to build a great body. The workouts that follow will\nshow you how to take advantage of them.\nWe’re assuming your gym has barbells, dumbbells, a\npowerrack, adjustable benches, cables, Swiss balls, and\npullup bars. With that much inventory, you can easily\ncomplete the various options of workouts we outline for\nyou. These include three distinct routines for gaining\nmuscle, two for losing fat, and two for body recomposition\n—workouts that hit the magical combination of both\nmuscle gain and fat loss to reshape your physique with\nminimal change in body weight.\nTHE BEST BODY-\nRECOMPOSITION\nWORKOUT [option A]\nWORKOUT #1    BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\nWe can’t ov erstate the awesomeness of German engineering. The\nland that brought us jet planes, the Mercedes, and Heidi Klum also\nintroduced perhaps the best method of body  recomposition known to the\nfitness industry —that is, a timeless strategy  to gain muscle and lose body  fat\nsimultaneously . A chtung!\nHOW IT WORKS\nHala Rambie, a scientist who defected to West Germany  during the C old War,\nfound that fat loss could be accelerated by  raising lev els of blood lactate—an\nenergy  substrate. More lactate corresponds to greater release of growth\nhormone, which tells y our body  to grow muscle and burn flab.\nThe best way to raise lactate quickly is to pair upper-\nand lower-body exercises, or opposing movements, for\nreps in the 8–15 range. The sweet spot for sets is three,\nand rest periods are restricted to 30–60 seconds. This\napproach has since become known as German Body Comp.\nDIRECTIONS\nA lternate sets of “A ” and “B” exercises. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a\nset of B, rest again, and so on for all the prescribed sets. The remaining\nexercises are done as straight sets.\nTo increase the intensity, decrease your rest between\nsets by 15 seconds every two weeks. Start by resting 60\nseconds for the first two weeks. Then in Weeks 3 and 4,\nrest 45 seconds, and so on.\nTEMPO\nEach exercise is assigned a tempo.\n(A  “0” indicates no time—simply  mov e on to the next digit.) For example, a\nfront squat with a tempo of 3110 would be done like so: Take three seconds\nto lower y ourself into the squat. Pause for one second at the bottom. Take\none second to come back up to standing, and then go right back into the\ndescent.\n1A DEADLIFT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand with your feet hip width. Bend your hips back to\nreach down and grasp the bar, hands just outside your\nknees. Keeping your lower back in its natural arch, drive\nyour heels into the floor and pull the bar up along your\nshins until you’re standing with hips fully extended and\nthe bar is in front of your thighs.\n1B 1¼ NEUTRAL-GRIP DUMBBELL\nBENCH PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3020 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand.\nTurn your wrists so your palms face each other. Press the\nweights over your chest and then lower back down.\nCome back up one quarter of the way, and then down\nagain. Now press up to lockout once more. That’s one\nrep. Take three seconds to lower the weights down from\nthe lockout position, and two seconds when pressing to\nlockout.\n2A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 (EACH SIDE) TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in\neach hand and rest the top of your left foot on the\nbench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee\nnearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to\nthe floor.\n2B INVERTED ROW\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 2011 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet a barbell in a power rack (or use a Smith machine) at\nabout hip height. Lie underneath it and grasp it with\nhands about shoulder-width apart. Hang from the bar so\nyour body forms a straight line. Squeeze your shoulder\nblades together and pull yourself up until your back is fully\ncontracted.\n3A DIP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\nSuspend yourself over the bars of a dip station and lower\nyour body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\n3B SEATED INCLINE DUMBBELL CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet an adjustable bench between 45 and 60 degrees and\nsit back against it with a dumbbell in each hand. Curl the\nweights to shoulder height without allowing your elbows\nto drift in front of your shoulders.\n4 SWISS BALL ROLLOUT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 TEMPO: 2020 REST: 60 SEC.\nKneel on the floor and rest your forearms on a Swiss ball.\nKeeping your core braced, roll the ball forward so your\narms are extended. Stop before your lower back begins\nto sag. Roll yourself back.\nTHE BEST BODY-\nRECOMPOSITION\nWORKOUT [option B]\nWORKOUT #2    BY JOE DOWDELL, C.S.C.S.\nUse this routine just as y ou did the prev ious one—Body -\nRecomposition O ption A . It’s another example of German Body  C omp\ntraining and can be done in conjunction with O ption A . If y ou choose to do\nthe two workouts for a few weeks, alternate them for three sessions per\nweek, resting a day  between workouts (and then two day s afterward before\nrepeating).\n1A FRONT SQUAT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet a barbell on a power rack at about shoulder height.\nGrasp the bar with hands at shoulder width and raise your\nelbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\nTake the bar out of the rack and let it rest on your\nfingertips—as long as your elbows stay up, you’ll be able\nto balance the bar. Step back and set your feet at\nshoulder width with toes turned out slightly. Squat as low\nas you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\n1B NEUTRAL-GRIP CHINUP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 4010 REST: 60 SEC.\nUse a chinup bar that has handles so you can grasp it with\nyour palms facing each other (if you have only a straight\nbar, hook a V-grip cable handle over it, or use a\nsuspension trainer as shown). Hang from the handles and\nthen pull yourself up until your chin is over them.\n2A ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8–10 TEMPO: 3110 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold a barbell with a shoulder-width grip and stand with\nfeet hip width. Bend your hips back as far as you can.\nAllow your knees to bend as needed while you lower the\nbar along your shins until you feel a stretch in your\nhamstrings.

But when\ny ou boil down the exercises y ou need to perform in order to cov er\nev ery  area, there are only  three y ou need to be concerned with—a push, a\npull, and a squat. This is the ultimate in minimalism and works superbly  for\nbeginners or people who are short on time.\nHOW IT WORKS\nA ny  kind of pressing exercise will train y our chest, shoulders, and triceps. A ny\npulling mov ement (a row or chinup v ariation) recruits y our back, rear delts,\nbiceps, and forearms. Squatting mov ements (and deadlifts, which aren’t quite\na squat but require all the same muscles) take care of the quads, hamstrings,\nand glutes. Ev en y our calv es get some stimulation as they  help to stabilize\ny our squat. Your abs, of course, get worked on all these mov ement patterns,\nprov ided they ’re done with free weights rather than machines, and work to\nbrace y our spine throughout.\nThe workout at right contains everything you need to\nput on size fast—a squat, press, and pullup—done with\nheavy weights, and you should be able to wrap it up\nwithin 45 minutes.\nDIRECTIONS\nC omplete all fiv e sets for the squat and then perform the ov erhead press and\nweighted pullup in alternating fashion. That is, complete a set of the press,\nrest, then do a set of the pullup, rest again, and repeat until y ou’v e finished all\nfiv e sets for each.\n1 SQUAT\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 120 SEC.\nSet up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart\nas is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your\nshoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the\nrack. Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width\nand your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep\nbreath and bend your hips back and then bend your\nknees to lower your body as far as you can without losing\nthe arch in your lower back. Push your knees outward as\nyou descend. Extend your hips to come back up,\ncontinuing to push your knees outward.\n2A OVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet the bar up in a squat rack or cage and grasp it just\noutside shoulder width. Take the bar off the rack and\nhold it at shoulder level with your forearms perpendicular\nto the floor. Squeeze the bar and brace your abs. Press\nthe bar overhead, pushing your head forward and\nshrugging your traps as the bar passes your face.\n2B WEIGHTED PULLUP\nSETS: 5 REPS: 5 REST: 90 SEC.\nAttach a weighted belt to your waist, hold a dumbbell\nbetween your feet, or if you can’t complete your reps\nwith weight, use body weight alone. Hang from a pullup\nbar with hands just outside shoulder width. Pull yourself\nup until your chin is over the bar.\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY\nMUSCLE WORKOUT [option\nB]\nWORKOUT #4    BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\nA pply ing the same principle as the prev ious workout, here we offer\nthree different push, pull, and lower-body  exercises with some\nadditional ab and calf work thrown in. This routine is ideal if y ou find y ourself\nwith a bit more time to train than y ou did when choosing O ption A . It can\nalso be alternated with O ption A , to add some v ariety  to y our training. The\ndifferent exercise and rep ranges will switch up the muscle-building stimulus.\nDIRECTIONS\nA lternate sets of the bench press and seated cable row. So y ou’ll do one set\nof 1A , rest, then one set of 1B, rest again, and repeat until all sets are\ncomplete. Perform the remaining exercises as normal straight sets.\n1A BENCH PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the bar just outside shoulder width and arch your\nback so there’s space between your lower back and the\nbench. Pull the bar out of the rack and lower it to your\nsternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your\nsides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet\nhard into the floor and press the bar back up.\n1B SEATED CABLE ROW\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach a straight or lat-pulldown bar to the pulley of a\nseated row station. Sit on the bench or floor with your\nfeet against the foot plate and knees slightly bent.\nKeeping your lower back flat, bend forward at the hips to\ngrasp the bar and row it to your sternum, squeezing your\nshoulder blades together in the end position. Extend your\narms and feel the stretch in your back before beginning\nthe next rep.\n2 DUMBBELL ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 90 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with feet hip\nwidth. Push your hips back and, keeping your lower back\nin its natural arch, bend your torso forward, lowering until\nyou feel a stretch in your hamstrings, bending slightly at\nthe knees as needed. Squeeze your glutes as you come\nback up.\n3 PALLOF PRESS ISO HOLD\nSETS: 3 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 30 SEC.\nAttach a single-grip handle to a cable pulley and set it at\nabout shoulder height. (You can also use a band.) Grasp\nthe handle with one hand over the other and step away\nfrom the machine to put tension on the cable; turn to\nyour left 90 degrees so your right side is now facing the\nmachine. Stand with feet shoulder width and extend your\narms in front of you. The cable will try to twist your body\ntoward it—resist.\n4 STANDING CALF RAISE\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nUse a standing calf raise machine, or hold onto a sturdy\nobject and stand on a block as shown. Lower your heels\ntoward the floor until you feel a stretch in your calves.\nDrive the balls of your feet into the foot plate and\ncontract your calves, raising your heels as high as possible.\nControl the descent on each rep.\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY\nMUSCLE WORKOUT [option\nC]\nWORKOUT #5    BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\nHere, we continue the theme of pushing, pulling, and lower-body\nmov ements making up the core of the workout and add in some direct\narm work. The high-rep approach (sets of 15) works well in conjunction with\nthe prev ious two sessions, and y ou may  rotate through all three of them. For\ninstance, perform option A  on Monday , option B on Wednesday , and option C\non Friday .\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) in alternating fashion. So\ny ou’ll do one set of A , rest, then one set of B, rest again, and repeat until all\nsets are completed for the pair. The remaining exercises are done\nconv entionally .\n1 TRAP-BAR DEADLIFT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 120 SEC.\nUse a trap bar and stand with feet hip width. Bend your\nhips back and grasp the handles.

Keeping your\nupper arms stationary, curl the bar.\n3B DECLINE EZ-BAR LYING TRICEPS\nEXTENSION\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet an adjustable bench to a slight decline and lie back on\nit holding an EZ-curl bar at shoulder width. Press the bar\nover your chest and then let your upper arms drift back\nto about a 45-degree angle, which becomes your starting\nposition. Bend your elbows to lower the bar behind your\nhead, and then extend them to return to the starting\nposition for the next rep.\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY\nFAT-LOSS WORKOUT\n[option A]\nWORKOUT #6    BY CRAIG RASMUSSEN, C.S.C.S.\nMost big-box gy ms feature a cluster of machines arranged in such a\nway  as to prov ide members with a “circuit.” C ircuits are a gy m’s\nequiv alent of a no-brainer, requiring only  that the trainee mov e from machine\nto machine for a prescribed number of repetitions, ov er and ov er again.\nWe’ve got a better circuit—one that involves free\nweights, to build more muscle, burn more calories, and\nkeep you challenged for the long term.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThis routine prioritizes abs by  placing them first. From there, y ou’ll mov e on\nto a light circuit that will burn loads of calories. Finally , y ou’ll hit the main\ncircuit, which builds strength and muscle.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the first exercise as straight sets. Exercises 2A  through 2D are done\nas a complex, so choose one pair of dumbbells and use them for each mov e.\nUse a load that allows y ou to complete y our reps on y our weakest exercise in\nthe series. Perform six reps for each of the exercises. Rest 90 seconds and\nrepeat.\nFor exercises 3A through 3D, adjust your equipment\nand loads as necessary, but perform them in the same\ncircuit fashion. If you choose to repeat the workout, vary\nthe sets and reps you perform on these last four exercises\neach session. This will help you to continue milking gains\nfrom the circuit for months on end. Rotate between 3\nsets of 10 reps, 4 sets of 5 reps, and 2 sets of 15 reps.\n1 SWISS BALL PLANK CIRCLE\nSETS: 2 REPS: 30–45 SECONDS (EACH DIRECTION) REST: 60–90\nSEC.\nPlace a Swiss ball on the floor and get into pushup\nposition with your hands on it.

Hang\nfrom the bar and then pull yourself up until your chin is\nover it.\n \n04   BARBELL\nBecause of its association with bench pressing, squatting,\nand deadlifting, the barbell tends to be thought of as a\ntool that’s good only for performing specific lifts or hitting\none muscle group at a time. In later chapters we’ll show\nyou how to get great workouts for any body part with a\nbarbell alone, but here we’ve got routines that work your\nwhole body.\nYou don’t necessarily need a bench, a rack, or even\ntwo matched plates to get a good workout with a barbell.\nA corner of a room in which you can wedge one end can\nbe enough. And if you use the Olympic lifts—the exercises\ncontested in Olympic weightlifting competitions—you can\nhit every major muscle of the body in minutes. These are\njust two of the approaches you’re about to discover.\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY\nWORKOUT [option A]\nWORKOUT #8    BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\nIf y ou train at home or any where else that prov ides only  a barbell\nand a small amount of weight, y ou can make the most of it by\nspeeding or slowing y our reps and performing y our exercises circuit-sty le.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe barbell was inv ented to carry  balanced loads but works just as well out\nof balance. The following exercises can be performed with one end wedged\nbetween two walls while y ou lift the other end like a lev er. You may  find\nthat pressing the bar like a lev er feels less stressful to y our shoulders, plus it\nactiv ates y our core to a greater degree.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without\nrest. If an exercise feels easy  using the load y ou hav e av ailable, perform\ny our reps slower and with more control. (O r, if y ou hav e extra weight, load\nit.) A nother option is to choke down on the bar. Gripping it lower will decrease\ny our mechanical adv antage and make the exercise harder.\nAfter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then\nrepeat the entire circuit. Continue for 20 minutes. You\ncan repeat the workout up to four times per week,\nresting a day between sessions.\n1 SPLIT SQUAT TO PRESS\nREPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nWedge the end of the barbell into a corner of the room\n(to avoid damage to the walls, you may have to wrap a\ntowel around it). Load the opposite end with a weight\nplate and grasp it toward the end. Get into a lunge\nposition with your left leg in front, bent to where your\nthigh is parallel to the floor and your right knee nearly\ntouches the floor. Stand up explosively and press the bar\nstraight up.\n2 SINGLE-ARM ROW W/ PARTIAL\nLUNGE\nREPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nHold the barbell behind the sleeve (where you load the\nweights) with your left hand. Get into a lunge position\nbut not deep—keep both legs slightly extended so that\nthe bar and plate don’t brush the floor. Draw your\nshoulder blade back and row the bar to your ribs.\n3 BARBELL RUSSIAN TWIST\nREPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nGrasp the bar near the very end again—this time with\nboth hands. Stand with feet shoulder width. Swing the\nbar to your left, pivoting your feet as needed, and then\nswing to your right.\n4 LEVER FLOOR PRESS\nREPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 120 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor and grasp the end of the\nbar again behind the sleeve with your left hand. Hold it\njust above your shoulder and extend your right arm out\nto your side for support. Press the bar over your chest.\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY\nWORKOUT [option B]\nWORKOUT #9    BY BRIAN GRASSO\nC all this one the “No Excuses Workout” because we hav e y et to hear\na compelling reason why  someone can’t succeed with it. First of all, it\ntakes only  six minutes to complete. Second, it requires just a barbell and a\npair of plates. Load the bar once and y ou’re ready  to go. Think y ou can\nhandle that?\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe workout is a barbell complex—a series of exercises that flow. The finish\nposition of the hang clean sets y ou up perfectly  for the front squat, which then\nallows y ou to mov e right into the ov erhead press, and so on.\nChoose one weight, which will be determined by the\nexercise you can lift the least amount on (in this case, the\noverhead lunge), and go for it. The pace will be so\nintense that you’ll be grateful the workout is over in six\nminutes. Fortunately, your metabolism will remain\naccelerated for 48 hours afterward.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without\nrest. C omplete three reps for each mov e. Time y our circuit. A fter the last\nexercise, check y our timer and rest as long as it took y ou to perform the\ncircuit. Repeat for three total circuits.\nChoose a load you could use for 10 reps on a normal\noverhead press, and keep that same weight for all the\nexercises.\n1 ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\nHold the bar at shoulder width and stand with feet hip\nwidth. Bend your hips back as far as you can. Allow your\nknees to bend as needed while you lower the bar along\nyour shins until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.\nKeep your lower back arched throughout. Squeeze your\nglutes as you come back up.\n2 HANG CLEAN\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\nWith the bar in front of your thighs, bend your hips and\nknees so that the bar lowers to just above your knees.\nNow explosively extend your hips as if jumping while at\nthe same time shrugging your shoulders and pulling the\nbar straight up in front of your torso. As the bar reaches\nchest level, bend your elbows so that your palms face the\nceiling and catch the bar at shoulder level. Bend your hips\nand knees as you catch the bar to absorb the impact.\n3 FRONT SQUAT\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\nFrom the catch position of the hang clean, squat as low\nas you can without losing the arch in your lower back.\n4 OVERHEAD PRESS\nREPS: 3 REST: 0 SEC.\nFrom standing, press the bar overhead, pushing your\nhead forward and shrugging your traps as the bar passes\nyour face.\n5 OVERHEAD LUNGE\nREPS: 3 (EACH SIDE) REST: SEE DIRECTIONS\nHold the bar overhead and step forward with your left\nleg. Lower yourself until your left thigh is parallel to the\nfloor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor.\n \n05   DUMBBELLS &\nKETTLEBELLS\nEver since the reemergence of the kettlebell as a training\nstaple about a decade ago, there’s been a debate over\nwhich is superior, dumbbells or kettlebells. While this\nargument is pretty much a stalemate, we’ll take\nkettlebells.\nFor one, kettlebells have thicker handles, so your grip\nand forearms are recruited more heavily. For another, the\nbell hangs at a distance from the handle, so the load is\noffset, which makes every move more difficult to stabilize\nand more demanding of your core to provide that stability.\nFurthermore, just about any exercise you can think to do\nwith a dumbbell can be replicated with a kettlebell and will\nfeel much harder.\nBut, hey, people have been getting ripped sans\nkettlebells for years, so if dumbbells are all you have,\nforget what you read above. Dumbbells tend to take up\nless space and are a little more convenient to store, and\nthey’re certainly more common and easy to find, so you\nmight as well learn how to make the most of them.\nThis chapter explores your options when training\nconditions are most dire—when you have access only to\nembarrassingly light weights, mismatched weights, or even\njust one weight. All the workouts that follow can be\nperformed with either dumbbells or kettlebells. Or, a single\nbell, as the case may be.\nTHE BEST TWO-\nDUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL\nWORKOUT [option A]\nWORKOUT #10    BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\nWhether y ou’re v isiting relativ es or in a hotel with an underwhelming\n“fitness center,” there may  come a time when all y ou hav e access to\nis a measly  pair of dumbbells or kettlebells. Not a problem, now that y ou\nhav e this routine.\nHOW IT WORKS\nIn this situation, the load y ou hav e will be more appropriate for some\nexercises than others. To see that y ou get the most out of the workout we\nprescribe here, whatev er the poundage y ou hav e to work with, y ou’ll need to\nadjust the speed of y our reps. A  pair of 25-pound dumbbells, for example,\nprobably  won’t be challenging on exercises such as the stepup. In this case,\nperform y our reps more slowly  to test y our endurance and build muscle\ncontrol. O n other exercises, like the bentov er lateral raise, 25 pounds may  be\njust right or a bit heav y , so perform y our reps explosiv ely .\nIf you should happen to have two unevenly weighted\ndumbbells, such as a 25-pounder and a 15-pounder, don’t\nbe discouraged. Simply switch the weights in your hands\neach time you repeat the circuit. Asymmetrical loads force\nyour core to stabilize you even more on each exercise.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest two minutes and then repeat. C ontinue for 20\nminutes. You can repeat the workout up to four times per week.\n1 SIDE PLANK W/ LATERAL RAISE\nSETS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nLie on your left side resting your left forearm on the floor\nfor support. Hold the dumbbell in your right hand. Raise\nyour hips up so that your body forms a straight line and\nbrace your abs—your weight should be on your left\nforearm and the edge of your left foot. From this\nposition, raise the weight in your right hand until your arm\nis parallel to the floor. If the dumbbell or kettlebell you\nhave is too heavy to perform a lateral raise with in this\nposition, you can use a weight plate from the dumbbell (if\nit’s the plate-loaded kind), or simply skip the lateral raise\nand use the weight to resist your side plank.\n2 SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT\nSETS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nHold a dumbbell in one hand and stand on the opposite\nleg. Bend your hips back and lower your torso until you\nfeel your lower back is about to lose its arch.

High reps,\ncircuits, and supersets (two exercises done back to back with no rest) can\nmake ev en the lightest weights feel heav y  after a while and make the\nworkout double as a cardio session.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe biggest obstacle y ou’re likely  to face with nothing but dumbbells at y our\ndisposal is a lack of weight to make y our legs work hard. This workout’s fast\npace will help to offset that, and so will working one leg at a time. Be\nprepared to switch to lighter dumbbells on subsequent circuits when the\nfatigue really  kicks in. If y ou hav e only  one pair of dumbbells, ignore the rep\nranges on ev ery thing but the Bulgarian split squat and stepup, and go for as\nmany  reps as possible each set.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform exercises 1A  through 1C  as a circuit. So, y ou’ll do one set of the\nBulgarian split squat, one set of stepups, and then one set of the dumbbell\nsquat before resting for two minutes. Repeat until all the prescribed sets are\ncomplete. Perform the remaining paired exercises (2A  and 2B, 3A  and 3B) as\nsupersets. That means y ou’ll do a set of A  and then a set of B before resting,\nand repeat until all sets are completed for the pair. The last exercise, the\npushup, is done as conv entional straight sets.\n1A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nStand lunge-length in front of a bench. Hold a dumbbell in\neach hand and rest the top of your left foot on the\nbench behind you. Lower your body until your rear knee\nnearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to\nthe floor.\n1B STEPUP\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nStand behind a bench or other elevated surface that will\nput your thigh at parallel to the floor when you place your\nfoot onto it. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and step up\nonto the bench but leave your trailing leg hanging off.\n1C DUMBBELL SQUAT\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 120 SEC.\nHold dumbbells at shoulder level and stand with your feet\nshoulder width. Sit back with your hips and lower your\nbody as far as you can without losing the arch in your\nlower back.\n2A ELBOW-OUT DUMBBELL ROW\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 REST: 0 SEC.\nKeeping your lower back arched, bend your hips back\nuntil your torso is parallel to the floor. Turn your palms to\nface your legs, squeeze your shoulder blades together,\nand row the dumbbells—raising your arms out 90 degrees\nfrom your torso.\n2B DUMBBELL OVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 REST: 90 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with palms\nfacing in front of you. Brace your abs and press the\nweights overhead.\n3A ONE-ARM, ELBOW-IN DUMBBELL\nROW\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform a row as directed previously, but use one arm at\na time and draw your elbow straight back so you row the\nweight to your side with palm facing in.\n3B ONE-ARM, ELBOW-IN DUMBBELL\nOVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 90 SEC.\nPerform an overhead press as directed previously, but use\none arm at a time and turn your palm to face in.\n4 PUSHUP\nSETS: 2–3 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 60 SEC.\nPlace your hands on the floor at shoulder width. Keeping\nyour abs braced and your body in a straight line, squeeze\nyour shoulder blades together and lower your body until\nyour chest is an inch above the floor.\nTHE BEST ONE-\nDUMBBELL/KETTLEBELL\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #12    BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S.\nA s trendy  as kettlebells hav e become, many  chain gy ms don’t offer\nenough that y ou can be sure y ou’ll get a matching pair at a giv en time\n(especially  if that time is during peak hours). Your best bet then is to do what\ny ou can with a single kettlebell.\nIncidentally, if you train at home and have just one\ndumbbell that you’ve been using as a paperweight up until\nnow, this workout applies equally to you (kettlebells and\ndumbbells can be used interchangeably).\nHOW IT WORKS\nO ne bell offers a distinct set of benefits from a pair. Your body  will hav e to\ncompensate for the imbalance by  recruiting y our core muscles more intensely ,\nand working one side at a time will make for longer sets with a greater\ncardiov ascular demand. Done as a circuit, the exercises that follow raise y our\nheart rate ev en further, making this workout a great adjunct to a strict diet for\nfat loss.\nDIRECTIONS\nThe workout consists of two circuits. In C ircuit 1, y ou’ll perform the exercises\nin sequence for six reps each. C omplete as many  rounds as possible in six\nminutes, and then rest one minute. Repeat twice more and then rest two\nminutes before beginning C ircuit 2.\n CIRCUIT 1\n1 ONE-ARM SNATCH\nREPS: 6 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nHold a kettlebell in front of your thighs with your right\nhand and stand with feet between hip and shoulder\nwidth. Keep your torso as upright as possible and bend\nyour knees until the weight hangs at mid-shin level—\nmaintain the arch in your lower back. Jump, extending\nyour hips explosively, and raise the weight straight up\nyour body. When it gets to your chest, flip your wrist and\n“catch” the bell overhead with arm extended.\n2 KETTLEBELL PRESS-OUT\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\nHold the weight close to your chest at shoulder level with\nboth hands on the handle and palms facing each other.\nSquat down as deeply as you can and then press the bell\nstraight out in front of you with arms extended. Bring it\nback to your chest and repeat for reps while maintaining\nthe squat position.\n3 HARD-STYLE KETTLEBELL SWING\nREPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with feet hip-width apart and the weight on the\nfloor. Grasp the kettlebell with both hands (palms facing\nyou) and, keeping your lower back flat, extend your hips\nto raise it off the floor. From there, take a deep breath\nand bend your hips back, allowing the weight to swing\nback between your legs. Explosively extend your hips and\nexhale—allowing the momentum to swing the weight up\nto shoulder level. Control the descent, but use the\nmomentum to begin the next rep.\n CIRCUIT 2\nTURKISH GETUP\nLie on your back on the floor holding a kettlebell with\nyour right hand over your chest, arm perpendicular to the\nfloor. Bend your right knee 90 degrees and plant your\nfoot on the floor. Brace your abs and raise your torso off\nthe floor. Use your left hand for support. Now use your\nright foot to raise your hips off the floor. Sweep your left\nleg back and rest on your left knee. Come up to a\nstanding position, and then reverse the motion to return\nto the floor. Note that the foot that rests on the floor\nchanges with the hand that’s holding the weight (when\nyou perform the getup with the left hand, your left foot\nwill lie flat).\nPerform one rep with the weight in your right hand and\nthen immediately switch hands and repeat. Switch back\nto your right hand and do two reps. Then do two on\nyour left. Continue adding one extra rep in this fashion\nuntil you’re up to five on each side. Without rest, reverse\nthe process and work back down to one rep.\n \n06   MACHINES\nWe’ve never been big fans of machines at Men’s Fitness.\nFor most people, they represent taking the path of least\nresistance—literally. Machines determine your range of\nmotion and the way your muscles move the weight, so\nyou don’t train your body to do these things. If you’re\njust getting into lifting and want to gain weight and get\nstronger, machines aren’t the best way to go. But if\nyou’re older and have nagging injuries, or you want to\nisolate one muscle at a time to bring it up, machines may\nbe your best weapons.\nOf course, you may find yourself in a situation where it’s\nmachines or bust, as in the case of some hotel gyms and\ncommunity fitness centers. In any event, you can get just\nas hard a workout with machinery as you can with iron.\nA note here: Whenever possible, we’d prefer you do\nyour machine exercises on Hammer Strength equipment\n(lifefitness.com). This is a quality brand that offers a\nunique feature—isolateral movement. That means you can\nlift each limb independently. In this way, Hammer\nStrength equipment follows your unique biomechanics,\nletting your limbs work in their natural fashion, rather than\nhaving to conform to the narrower paths that most\nmachines set.\nTHE BEST ALL-MACHINE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #13    BY JASON FERRUGGIA\nThere are three likely  reasons y ou would do a workout entirely  with\nmachines. O ne is that y ou fear free weights. A nother is that y ou’re in\na hotel gy m with machines as y our only  workout options, and the third is that\ny ou’re a little beat up and need to protect ov erworked joints or work around\nnagging injuries. Whatev er the case may  be, machines are suitable muscle-\nbuilding equipment, and y ou can train y our whole body  with them.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThis workout uses a classic body building approach: py ramid sets. You start\nwith higher reps and increase the weight slightly  each set while reducing reps\nto gradually  warm up the muscles and joints and recruit more and more\nmuscle fibers. No matter how hard y ou train or how heav y  y ou go, y ou’re\nunlikely  to get injured, because the machines are stabilizing the load for y ou.\nThis isn’t alway s ideal, but it does allow y ou to push y ourself and focus y our\nmind solely  on the muscles y ou want to work without worry ing about a freak\naccident keeping y ou out of the gy m for weeks.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll\ndo a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the\nprescribed sets. The remaining exercises are done as conv entional straight\nsets.\n1A CHEST PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nAdjust the height of the seat so that the handles are in\nline with the middle of your chest. When you grasp the\nhandles, your elbows should be bent nearly 90 degrees.\nPress the handles until your elbows are locked out. Keep\ntension on your muscles at the bottom of each rep.\n1B CHEST-SUPPORTED ROW\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nUsing a chest-supported row machine, row the weight to\nyour belly, squeezing your shoulder blades together at\nthe top of the movement.\n2A SHOULDER PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nAdjust the seat of a shoulder press machine so that the\nhandles are at shoulder level. If you have shoulder\nproblems, and if your machine allows it, grasp the handles\nso your palms face each other. Otherwise, grasp them\nwith palms facing forward as normal. Make sure your\nelbows track in a normal pressing path as you press the\nhandles overhead.\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP PULLDOWN\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15, 12, 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach a close-grip V-handle to the pulley of a lat-\npulldown machine, or use two single-grip handles as\nshown. Grasp the handle so your palms face each other\nand set your legs under the pad. Pull the handle to your\ncollarbone, driving your elbows down and back.\n3 CALF RAISE ON LEG PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 25, 20, 15 REST: 60 SEC.\nSet up in a leg press machine and place your feet at the\nbottom of the foot plate at shoulder width so that only\nthe balls of your feet are on the plate. Remove the\nsafeties and allow the weight to flex your ankles slowly\nuntil you feel a stretch in your calves. Extend your ankles\nto raise the weight back up.\n4 LEG PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 25, 20, 15, 10 REST: 120 SEC.\nAdjust the seat of the machine so that you can sit\ncomfortably with your hips beneath your knees and your\nknees in line with your feet. Remove the safeties and\nlower your knees toward your chest until they’re bent 90\ndegrees and then press back up. Be careful not to go too\nlow or you risk your lower back coming off the seat\n(which can cause injury).\n \n07   BANDS\nThe elastic exercise band tends to get lumped in with the\nBody Bar, aerobics step, and Shake Weight as so-called\n“wussy” equipment, while the barbell and dumbbell are\nbeyond reproach. But this isn’t a fair judgment, especially\nif you’re using high-quality bands.\nWe like the loop bands that Elitefts.net sells. They’re\ndurable and can be used for multiple purposes\nandnumerous exercises. If a cheap one is all you have, you\ncan make do, but Elite’s bands are a good investment,\nespeciallyif you plan on traveling a lot. Lightweight and\ncompact, they allow you to take your workouts with you.\nWhat bands provide that no other equipment (except\ncables) can is accommodating resistance. Take the\npushup, for example. The closer you get to locking out\nyour elbows, the easier the exercise feels. The movement\nfeels hardest when your chest is close to the floor. Adding\nresistance to the pushup with a band will intensify the last\nfew inches of the move—as the band gets more\nstretched out—making you work harder, and there’s\nnothing wussy about that.\nTHE BEST FULL-BODY\nBAND WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #14    BY BEN BRUNO\nThis workout gets y our blood mov ing. In fact, it makes it run up and\ndown y our body  as y ou alternate between upper- and lower-body\nexercises, forcing y our heart to work extra hard, which in turn, stimulates\ncalorie burning. The result is increased strength and conditioning while\ntrimming fat.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe exercises are grouped into “non-competing” mini-circuits. This means that\nthey  work different areas of the body  so muscle fatigue isn’t carried ov er from\none mov e to the next. For instance, following up a pushup with a good\nmorning won’t make y our chest any  more tired, so y ou can giv e each\nexercise y our full effort and strength. Your heart, howev er, experiences the\nopposite effect. With blood racing back and forth to different muscles, y our\nheart rate is constantly  elev ated. This leads to more calories burned during the\nworkout and greater fat loss afterward.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise groups in sequence. So y ou’ll do one set of A , B, and C ,\nresting as prescribed between them, and then repeat until all the prescribed\nsets for that group are completed. Note that the last group is just two\nexercises, though done in the same fashion. Make sure y ou hav e a few\ndifferent band options so y ou can use the appropriate tension on each\nexercise.\n1A PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the end of a band in one hand and wrap it around\nyour back. Get into pushup position with your hands\nshoulder width and your core braced. Pin both hands to\nthe floor with the ends of the band in your palms and\nperform pushups.\n1B GOOD MORNING\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on the band and loop the other end over the back\nof your neck and stand tall. Keeping your lower back in its\nnatural arch, bend your hips back and lower your torso\nuntil it’s nearly parallel to the floor. Think about keeping\nyour chest up and pointing forward. Explosively extend\nyour hips to come back up.\n1C PULL APART\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on and grasp a band loop, or a single tube as\nshown, hands shoulder width. Keeping your arms straight,\nraise your arms in front of your body to shoulder level.\nNow, without letting your arms drop, draw your arms out\n90 degrees to your sides as if you were pulling the tube\napart. Squeeze your shoulder blades together.\n2A SQUAT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on the band or tube with feet shoulder width and\ntoes turned slightly out. Grasp the ends of the band in\neach hand and hold them at shoulder level with palms\nfacing you. Bend your hips back and squat down as low as\nyou can without losing the arch in your lower back.\nExplosively extend your hips to come back up.\n2B BAND ROW\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach the band to a doorknob or other sturdy object of\nsimilar height. Hold the opposite end in both hands and\nstand back from the door so you feel tension on the\nband. Row the band to your belly.\n2C PALLOF PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach the band to a sturdy object at stomach level. Hold\nthe other end with both hands and step away from the\nattachment point, turning your body perpendicular to it\nto put tension on the band. Pull the band in front of your\nchest and then press it out with arms straight. Bend your\narms and draw your hands back toward you, resisting the\nband from twisting your torso. That’s one rep.\n3A TRICEPS PUSHDOWN\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach the band to a sturdy overhead object and grasp\nthe free end with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your\nsides and extend your elbows to lock them out.\n3B BICEPS CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding an end in each\nhand. Curl it without letting your upper arms drift\nforward.\n \n08   SUSPENSION\nTRAINER\nThe suspension trainer boom began about a decade ago,\nand what was once a piece of novel equipment is now\nhanging in gyms everywhere. The most popular brand, of\ncourse, is the TRX (trx.com), but competitors like the\nJungle Gym XT (lifelineusa.com)—which we use to show\nthe exercises that follow—are fine, too, so long as they\noffer foot cradles for performing lower-body exercises.\nWith a suspension trainer’s incredible versatility, the\nnumber of exercises you can perform with it is about\naslimitless as your imagination. It allows you to train the\nwhole body using exercises that would be nearly\nimpossible with free weights, machines, or any other\nequipment. And unlike those other tools, the suspension\ntrainer can travel anywhere you do, and takes up about as\nmuch space in your suitcase as a pair of pants.\nWe suggest you don’t leave home without either one.\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION-\nTRAINER WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #15    BY JAY CARDIELLO\nA  suspension trainer, such as the TRX or Jungle Gy m XT, can mean\nthe difference between sticking with y our training while on the road\nand returning from y our trav els feeling slobbish. So long as y our suspension\ntrainer is fully  adjustable and offers foot cradles y ou’ll hav e a total-body  gy m\nthat y ou can unpack from y our suitcase whenev er, wherev er.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe kind of instability  a suspension trainer prov ides is ideal for core\nstrengthening. To increase the instability , we’v e designed this workout using\nunilateral exercises, meaning that y ou’ll be training each side of y our body\nindiv idually . If y ou need to reduce the intensity  of an exercise, simply\nincrease the angle of y our body  to the floor (shorten the length of the\nhandles/straps).\nThe workout at right lets you customize your training,\ngiving you a specific period of time in which to do your\nreps, rather than a concrete number of reps to hit every\nset.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in sequence. Do\nas many  reps as y ou can in 30 seconds, resting only  as long as it takes to set\nup the next exercise. Perform two to four circuits.\n1 SINGLE-LEG ROW\nREPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nAttach a suspension trainer to a doorframe or other\nsturdy object and stand on your left leg. Hold the handles\nand get into a lunge position with your rear knee bent—\nbut keep your foot raised above the floor. Row your body\nto the handles while driving your right knee up in front of\nyou.\n2 SINGLE-LEG WOBBLE LUNGE\nREPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nSet the foot cradle of the suspension trainer to about a\nfoot and a half above the floor and turn around. Raise\nyour right foot and rest it inside the cradle. Bend your left\nknee so you descend into a lunge position.\n3 UNI-BRIDGE PRESS\nREPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nFace the suspension trainer’s attachment point and hold\none handle in your left hand. Pick up a water bottle (or\nsome other source of light resistance) in your right hand\nas if you were going to press. Lean back so your body is\nin a straight line at an angle, suspended by the handle.\nRow your body up until the handle touches your ribs\nwhile pressing the right hand over your chest.\n4 TAP OUT\nREPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 0\nSEC.\nSet your feet in the cradles of the trainer and get into\npushup position. Keeping your body straight, reach up\nwith your right hand and tap the inside of your left\nelbow. Put your hand back down and repeat with the left\nhand. Continue for 30 seconds.\n5 PUSHUP ROCKET\nREPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 30 SEC. REST: 0 SEC.\nGet into pushup position with your feet in the cradles of\nthe trainer and perform explosive pushups so that your\nhands leave the floor and you can clap in midair.\n \n09   MEDICINE BALL\nThe first medicine balls, used by athletes in ancient Persia,\nwere bladders filled with sand. While medicine ball\nconstruction has come a long way since then, the science\nof how to use one hasn’t really had to evolve.\nMed balls can be thrown, caught, rested on, or lifted\nlike other weights, to apply a variety of stimuli to the\nmuscles. Whether you want to experiment with one as a\nfun way to change up your workouts, or you find yourself\nsomeplace where the med ball (or a similar-sized volleyball\nor soccer ball) is the only implement you have to work\nwith, we can show you how to use it like the\nsophisticated tool that it is.\nTHE BEST MEDICINE-\nBALL WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #16    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nThe medicine ball has been around forev er, but most guy s don’t know\nwhat to do with it, besides holding it against their chests during situps.\nEv en a light ball can deliv er an intense workout that burns fat and builds\nathletic power.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe med ball can be used to replicate v arious O ly mpic weightlifting exercises,\nand it makes performing them much simpler. These burn calories and build\nspeed, which is helpful if y ou’re interested in being competitiv e in backy ard\npickup games. In fact, the med ball is probably  the most useful tool for\ndev eloping explosiv e strength because it’s meant to be thrown as hard as\npossible. When y ou toss it, y ou teach y our body  to accelerate without braking\nitself for safety .\nImagine a bench press done explosively—your shoulders\nmust slow it down at the end of the range of motion or\nthey risk getting torn out of their sockets by the speed.\nThe ball allows your body to “let go” safely because, well,\nyou actually let go.\nA med ball can also be used to create an unstable\nsurface, such as by doing pushups on it. The dome shape\nforces you to stabilize your body more or risk taking a spill,\nand that means more activation of the abs.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\ncomplete one set of A  and then B before resting. Repeat until all sets are\ncomplete and then go on to the next superset.\n1A CLEAN AND PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\nHold the ball and stand with feet shoulder width. Bend\nyour hips and knees and lower your body with arms\nextended until the ball is just above knee level. Explosively\nextend your hips and knees as if jumping, shrug your\nshoulders, and raise the ball to shoulder level. Squat down\nas you “catch” the momentum of the ball. Stand up and\npress it overhead. That’s one rep.\n1B SITUP AND THROW\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold the ball with both hands in front of your chest and\nsit on the floor. Anchor your feet under something sturdy\nfor support, and lie back on the floor a few feet away\nfrom a brick or concrete wall. Explosively sit up and throw\nthe ball into the wall and then catch it on the rebound. If\nyou have a partner, you can throw the ball to him instead\nand let him throw it back.\n2A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER\nSETS: 2 REPS: 20 (EACH LEG) REST: 0 SEC.\nHold the ball with both hands and get into pushup\nposition on the floor. Drive one knee up to your chest\nand then quickly drive it back while you raise the opposite\nknee.\n2B CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\nSETS: 2 REPS: 15 REST: 60 SEC.\nGet into pushup position on the floor, resting your hands\non the ball. Keeping your body straight and your core\nbraced, perform a pushup on the ball.\n3A BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nStand lunge length in front of a bench holding the ball\nwith both hands at arm’s length overhead. Bend your left\nknee and rest the top of your left foot on the bench\nbehind you. Lower your body until your front thigh is\nparallel to the floor.\n3B SEATED KNEE TUCK\nSETS: 2 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nSit on a bench and squeeze the ball between your feet.\nExtend and elevate your legs out in front of you and\nextend your torso so that your body forms a straight line.\nHold on to the bench for support. Crunch your torso\nforward and bring your knees to your chest.\n \n10   SWISS BALL\nSwiss balls were created as a tool for rehab, but their\nvalue in working the core and a host of stabilizer muscles is\nnow universally known. If you’re a man of average height\n(about 5′9″), a ball with a 65-centimeter diameter will\nwork best for you. Always make sure the ball is fully\ninflated and, for heaven’s sake, don’t try to stand on it.\nWacky parlor tricks have given the Swiss ball a bad name,\nbut used properly, it can improve your balance and\nstrength rather than deprive you of them.\nTHE BEST SWISS-BALL\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #17    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nIt may  be hard to imagine working y our entire body  with just a Swiss\nball. A fter all, y ou can’t curl it, press it, or squat it. But the ball can let\ny ou get into positions to work y our muscles that y ou wouldn’t normally  think\nof, and the stability  those positions require works more muscle than y ou\nrealize.\nHOW IT WORKS\nMany  of the exercises flow into each other or consist of combinations of\nmov ements that flow together to equal one rep. C ontrolling these mov ements\non an unstable ball makes ev ery  mov e a core exercise, ev en while y ou’re\ntargeting the chest, shoulders, legs, and back.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each in turn without\nrest. A fter the last exercise, rest two to three minutes and then repeat the\nentire circuit for three total sets.\n1 PUSHUP W/ FEET ON BALL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\nGet into pushup position on the floor with hands shoulder\nwidth and rest your feet on the ball. Brace your abs and\nlower your body until your chest is just above the floor.\nPush back up. Do not let your hips dip or sway side to\nside at any point.\n2 T ON BALL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\nLie chest-down on the ball and raise your arms out in\nfront of you with palms facing up. Now move them out\n90 degrees to form a T shape. Hold for one or two\nseconds with your shoulder blades squeezed together.\n3 BODY-WEIGHT SQUAT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out\nslightly. Sit back with your hips and lower your body as far\nas you can without rounding your lower back. Push your\nknees out as you descend and keep your chest up.\n4 LEG CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor and rest your heels on a\nSwiss ball. Brace your abs and drive your heels into the\nball to raise your hips off the floor. Bend your knees and\nroll the ball toward you. Keep your hips elevated the\nentire set.\n5 PIKE-UP TO SUPERMAN\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 120–180 SEC.\nGet into pushup position with your toes on the ball. Bend\nyour hips and roll the ball toward you so your torso\nbecomes vertical. Roll back so your body is straight again\nand extend your spine, then roll the ball up your legs so\nyour body forms a straight line with arms extended\noverhead but hands still on the floor. You should look like\nSuperman flying downward. That’s one rep. Pull with your\nlats to return to the pushup position and begin the next\nrep.\n \n11   BODY WEIGHT\nThe most obvious advantage of body-weight workouts is\nthat you can do them without equipment and in almost\nany location. But if that means absolutely no equipment—\nas in, not even a pullup bar—you’ll need to get pretty\ncreative to be able to work your back.\nWe got that creative.\nWhen it’s warm, you may want to take your workouts\noutdoors and make use of equipment at your local\nplayground, but you may not know how best to make a\nworkout with it.\nWe know how to make a workout with it.\nIf you thought body-weight training was just pushups\nand situps, these routines will open your eyes to the\nmultitude of ways you can get ripped at those times\nwhen you feel as if you have no options at all.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nWORKOUT [option A]\nWORKOUT #18    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nIf y ou’v e ev er wondered how guy s who work out exclusiv ely  on\nmonkey  bars in the park get so ripped, this workout is the answer. We\nhope y ou’ll take it outside on a summer day , but it can work just as well in a\nbare-bones garage gy m. Not only  will y ou burn fat and build muscle with just\nthree exercises—y ou’ll learn one of the secrets street gy mnasts use to bang\nout dozens of reps of pullups and dips at a clip: the 10 to 1 method.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe circuit we’v e designed here doesn’t let up. When y ou train any  squat\nv ariation, plus the pullup and the dip, y ou work nearly  ev ery  muscle in y our\nbody , and y our heart will race to supply  them with blood and oxy gen.\nPerforming a decreasing number of reps—10 to 1—helps y ou keep the\nworkout going despite being fatigued and builds the endurance that ultimately\nleads to being able to rattle off a high number of reps in one shot. In addition\nto getting y ou leaner, feel free to use this workout to win bar bets about how\nmany  pullups y ou can do.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as a circuit, completing a set of each in turn and resting\nas little as possible between sets. Repeat for 10 circuits (until y ou’re doing\nonly  one rep per exercise).\n1 JUMP SQUAT\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with feet shoulder-width apart and squat down\nabout halfway. Jump as high as you can. Land with soft\nknees and begin the next rep. Perform 10 reps. Each\ntime you repeat the circuit, perform one less rep. So the\nnext round you’ll do 9 reps, then 8, and so on down to 1\nrep.\n2 PULLUP\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\nHang from a pullup bar, jungle gym, or tree limb and pull\nyourself up until your chin is higher than your hands.\nPerform 10 reps down to 1 as described at left.\n3 DIP\nREPS: 10 TO 1 REST: 0 SEC.\nSuspend yourself over parallel bars and then lower your\nbody until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\nPerform 10 reps down to 1.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nWORKOUT [option B]\nWORKOUT #19    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nA  lack of training equipment doesn’t necessarily  doom y ou to a\nworkout consisting only  of pullups and pushups. With a little creativ ity ,\ny ou can still train like an animal (y ou’ll get the reference below) while\ntargeting y our entire body —not just the upper. This workout is outside the box\n—so much so, in fact, that y ou’ll hav e to go outdoors to do it.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThis routine requires a park or play ground area with monkey  bars and plenty\nof open space. You’ll use classic, though under-prescribed, body -weight\nexercises like the bear crawl and crab walk, which y ou probably  hav en’t tried\nsince y our day s in summer camp. A s y ou’ll come to remember, they ’re not\neasy —especially  for a grown man well north of 100 pounds. They  require a\nlot of work from y our heart, lungs, and core. Later, the parallel bar hand walk\nwill blow up y our grip and forearms; the sprints will fry  y our legs.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as supersets, so y ou’ll\ncomplete one set of A  and then one set of B before resting. Repeat until all\nsets are complete. Note that the parallel bar hand walk is done as straight sets\n—do a set, rest, and repeat.\nThis workout combines well with Body-Weight option A,\nso if you want to integrate them both into a training\nweek, perform A first, rest a day, and then perform B.\n(You can also add in option C, coming up next.)\n1A BEAR CRAWL\nSETS: 3 REPS: CRAWL FOR 50 FEET REST: 0 SEC.\nBend down and plant your hands on the ground. Try to\nkeep your back flat as you walk on all fours as fast as you\ncan. Your legs should be fairly straight as you step your\nfeet outside where your hands land.\n1B CRAB WALK\nSETS: 3 REPS: WALK FOR 50 FEET REST: AS NEEDED\nSit on the ground and bridge up with your hips so you\nlook like a tabletop. Walk forward on your hands and feet\nas fast as you can.\n2 PARALLEL BAR HAND WALK\nSETS: 5 REPS: WALK TO THE END AND BACK REST: AS NEEDED\nHang from a jungle gym or length of parallel bars. Walk to\nthe end of the row and back with your hands.\n3A FORWARD SPRINT\nSETS: 5 REPS: SPRINT 50 YARDS REST: 0 SEC.\nRun at about 90% of your top speed.\n3B BACKWARD SPRINT\nSETS: 5 REPS: SPRINT 50 YARDS REST: AS NEEDED\nRun backward as quickly as you can.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nWORKOUT [option C]\nWORKOUT #20    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nC ombining exercises whenev er possible helps y ou work more muscles\nin the same amount of time. These hy brid mov es allow y ou to get\nthe benefit of six exercises in a workout that actually  prescribes only  three.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThis workout can be combined with the prev ious two for a three-day -per-\nweek program done in the order shown. O r, combine it with either one of the\ntwo prev ious workouts and alternate them throughout the week.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as conv entional straight sets, completing all sets for one\nexercise before mov ing on to the next. If y ou can’t perform 10 reps for a\nparticular set, do as many  as y ou can without going to failure (end the set\nwith one or two reps in y ou) and then rest a few moments. C ontinue when\ny ou can to complete the remaining reps.\n1 BURPEE TO BROAD JUMP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 90 SEC.\nBend down and place your hands on the floor. Now shoot\nyour legs behind you fast so you end up in the top of a\npushup position. Perform a pushup and then jump your\nlegs back up to your hands. From there, jump forward as\nfar as you can.\n2 DIP TO LEG RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10\nSuspend your body over parallel bars and lower yourself\nuntil your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Press\nyourself back up and then raise your legs straight out in\nfront of you.\n3 PULLUP TO KNEE RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10\nHang from a pullup bar with hands outside shoulder width\nand palms facing away from you. Pull yourself up until your\nchin is over the bar and then raise your knees to your\nchest in the top position.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nWORKOUT [option D]\nWORKOUT #21    BY JOE STANKOWSKI, C.P.T.\nO K, we’ll admit it: Sometimes the odds really  are against y our getting\na workout in. You may  well find y ourself stuck without weights or\nbands, only  to find that y ou also forgot to pack y our suspension trainer.\nThere’s nothing to pull on, so y ou can’t work y our back, and y ou can’t ev en\nimprov ise with the objects around y ou.\nWe’re not sure just what kind of place this would be,\nshort of a jail cell (and if that’s where you are, hey, we’re\nnot judging), but we can give you a great workout to do,\neven there.\nHOW IT WORKS\nA ll y ou need is something to step on, be it a park bench, a large rock, or a\nchair. But if y ou hav e nothing elev ated on which to step, y ou can substitute a\nlunge for the stepup. To target y our back, which is usually  unworkable\nwithout hav ing at least a bar of some sort to pull on, we’re employ ing the\n“blurpee”—as made famous by  fitness expert Tim Ferriss, author of The Four-\nHour Body .\nThe wider foot placement used in the blurpee requires\nmore work from the lats to pull the hips and legs forward\nas the body comes back from the pushup position. (The\nextra “l” in blurpee stands for “lats.”)\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercises as conv entional straight sets, completing all sets for one\nexercise before mov ing on to the next.\n1 CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nGet into pushup position and place your hands close so\nthat your thumbs touch. Keep your body straight and\nyour core braced. If that’s too easy, elevate your feet on\na chair or some other raised surface.\n2 STEPUP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nStand in front of a bench or chair and place one foot on it\nso that your thigh is parallel to the floor. Drive your heel\ninto the surface and squeeze your glutes as you step up\nonto the bench, but let your trailing foot hang off of it.\n3 BLURPEE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nStand with feet outside shoulder width and bend down\nand place your hands on the floor. Now shoot your legs\nbehind you fast so you end up in the top of a pushup\nposition. Jump your legs back up so they land to the\noutside of your hands and then jump up quickly.\n \n12   ARMS\nSince it’s likely that arms were your first priority when you\nbegan training, and will continue to be for the rest of your\nlife, we put this body part first. Not that you’ll ever get\nbored of bombing your bi’s and tri’s, but we’ve provided\nyou with five different ways to work them—with a barbell,\ndumbbells, bands, a suspension trainer, and yes, even\nbody weight alone. Just try to leave some time in your\nweek for the leg workouts, OK?\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL-\nONLY ARM WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #22    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nYou can’t go wrong with a pair of dumbbells. A rguably  the most\nv ersatile equipment in a trainer’s arsenal, dumbbells are a fav orite\namong competitiv e body builders, who happen to know a thing or two about\nstacking impressiv e arms. Whether or not y ou want body build-eresque arms,\ndumbbells can prov e inv aluable in y our quest to improv e them.\nHOW IT WORKS\nYou’ll make use of peak contractions (holding the top, flexed, position of a rep\nfor a second or two), slow negativ es (lowering the weight with control), and\nstretching between sets. A ll of these strategies increase blood flow to the\narms and encourage growth.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform 1A  and 1B as supersets. So y ou’ll complete one set of A  and then go\non to B before resting. Repeat for the prescribed sets. Exercises 2A , 2B, and\n2C  are a triset—complete one set of each without rest and then repeat for all\nthe prescribed sets.\n1A SEATED CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\nSit on an incline bench or seat with a backrest holding a\ndumbbell in each hand. Keeping your upper arms against\nyour sides, curl the weights simultaneously, rotating your\nwrists outward so that your palms face you in the top\nposition. Hold the top position for two seconds,\nsqueezing your biceps, and take three to five seconds to\nlower the weights on each rep.\n1B DIAMOND PUSHUP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nGet into pushup position but place your hands close\ntogether so your thumbs and index fingers touch.\nKeeping your body in a straight line with abs braced,\nlower your torso until your chest is just above the floor\nand then press back up.\n2A HAMMER CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 0 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing your\nsides. Keeping your upper arms against your sides, curl\nthe weights at the same time.\n2B NEUTRAL-GRIP TRICEPS\nEXTENSION\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\nLie back on a bench or the floor holding a dumbbell in\neach hand with palms facing each other. Press the\nweights over your chest and then bend your elbows to\nlower the weights toward your face until you feel a\nstretch in your triceps. Extend your elbows. Keep your\nelbows facing the ceiling the entire set.\n2C BICEPS/TRICEPS STRETCH\nSETS: 4 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE)\nPlace the palm of one hand on a bench, box, or other\nlow, flat surface with your fingers pointing toward you.\nLean away to apply a stretch and hold it for 30 seconds.\nNow reach your arm overhead and bend the elbow.\nGently pull your arm behind your head to stretch your\ntriceps for 30 seconds.\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY\nARM WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #23    BY JASON FERRUGGIA\nA  barbell’s main selling point is that it allows y ou to maximally\nstimulate muscle, but it isn’t written in stone (or, perhaps, iron) that\ny ou must use heav y  weights, or any  weight at all. If a barbell is all y ou hav e\nto train with, we’ll assume that y ou don’t hav e a lot of weight at y our\ndisposal any way , so this workout is a minimalist’s dream.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe Poundstone curl is simply  a barbell curl done with the empty  bar alone—\nfor an enormous number of reps (in this case, we prescribe 100). It’s named\nafter professional strongman Derek Poundstone, who, despite being 350\npounds with biceps like footballs, still swears by  this deceptiv ely  hard\nexercise. The point is simply  to giv e the biceps shock treatment with a\nprotocol they ’v e nev er encountered before—v ery  high reps and short rest until\nexhaustion.\nThe pullover/triceps extension works your lats as well as\nyour triceps. By getting the lats involved, you incorporate\nstrong stabilizing muscles that will let you go a little heavier\non the triceps extensions—even if all the weight you have\nleft to add is a couple of 2.5-pound plates.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform all the sets for the first exercise before mov ing on to the second.\n1 POUNDSTONE CURL\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTAL REST: AS NEEDED\nGrasp the barbell at shoulder width. Keeping your upper\narms at your sides, curl the bar.\n2 PULLOVER/TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 6 REPS: 12–15 REST: 45 SEC.\nHold the bar with an overhand, shoulder-width grip and lie\nback on a flat bench. Press the bar toward the ceiling and\nthen reach it back over your head while bending your\nelbows until you feel a stretch in your lats. Then pull the\nbar back over your chest and extend your elbows.\nTHE BEST BAND-ONLY\nARM WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #24    BY NICK TUMMINELLO\nSometimes building muscle is as simple as doing reps as fast as y ou\ncan to get a pump as quickly  as possible. It may  sound haphazard,\nbut this band-only  workout can add as much as an inch to y our upper arms in\njust six weeks!\nHOW IT WORKS\nThis workout should be implemented for a period of six weeks—enough time\nto elicit growth, but not so much as to allow y our muscles to adapt to the\nstresses. O v er this time period, y ou’ll gradually  increase the v olume y ou\nperform on y our exercises (there are only  two), which forces y our body  to\nadapt to a rapidly  increasing workload. The pushdown and curl pump y our\narms full of blood, driv ing nutrients into the muscles and stretching their cells.\nA s fun as the pump is for showing off, it’s also a sign that real growth is on\nthe way .\nDIRECTIONS\nA lternate the band pushdown and band curl. Perform each mov e twice. If\ny ou like, repeat the workout once per week for up to six weeks. Perform two\nsets the second week as well, followed by  three sets in Weeks 3 and 4. In\nWeeks 5 and 6, perform four sets. A ssuming y ou’re following the weight-gain\neating rules outlined in C hapter 1, y ou could see up to a solid inch added to\ny our arms in that span.\n1 BAND PUSHDOWN\nREPS: 60 REST: 0 SEC.\nAttach the band to the top of a sturdy object, such as a\npipe or a beam. If you’re using a loop band, grasp the\nmiddle of it with both hands. Tuck your elbows to your\nsides and extend your elbows as in a triceps pushdown.\nTry to get 60 reps in 30 seconds. It’s OK if you rock back\nand forth a bit.\n2 BAND CURL\nREPS: 60 REST: 120 SEC.\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding the other end\nwith both hands. Curl as fast as you can for 30 seconds,\naiming again for 60 reps.\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION-\nTRAINER ARM WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #25    BY BEN BRUNO\nO v er the past decade, suspension trainers hav e sky rocketed in\npopularity , and for good reason. The kind of whole-body  training y ou\ncan perform on a suspension sy stem is as efficient as it is effectiv e, and\nstudies hav e shown that compound mov ements release more muscle-building\nhormones than do isolation mov es. While the following workout seems to\ntarget y our entire upper body , the stress it places on y our arms in particular\nwill get them looking as good as if they  were trained with isolation\nmov ements.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe workout starts with pushups and rows. It will hit the chest, shoulders,\nand back, too, of course; but it won’t shortchange y our biceps and triceps. In\nfact, ev en though y ou’re not working them in isolation, the bi’s and tri’s will\nkick in harder because they ’re lifting more of y our weight than they  could if\ny ou were doing simple curls or extensions. Nev ertheless, there’s a place for\nthese mov ements, too—right after the compound lifts, when y ou’re looking to\nfinish the arms off with more direct stimulation.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do\na set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed\nsets.\n1A PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach the suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object\nand lengthen the straps to a point where you’re sure you\ncan do 10–12 pushups. (You can lower the handles over\ntime to make the set harder, and later, elevate your feet;\nshorten the straps to make it easier.) Grasp the handles\nand get into pushup position with hands under your\nshoulders. Your entire body should be straight and your\ncore braced. Lower your body until your chest is between\nthe handles.\n1B ROTATIONAL INVERTED ROW\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold the handles and lean back with arms extended so\nthat your body is supported by the trainer and only your\nfeet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body\nin a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the\nharder the exercise; you can elevate your feet to make it\neven harder.) Start with your palms facing your feet, and\nas you row your body up, twist your wrists outward so\nthat your palms face up in the top position.\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nLengthen the straps and stand underneath the trainer’s\nanchor point. Lean your weight forward and bend your\nelbows so you feel a stretch in your triceps. Your palms\nshould face each other behind your head. Keeping your\nbody straight and your abs braced, extend your elbows,\nrotating your palms so they face down in the extended\nposition.\n2B BICEPS CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nFace the trainer’s attachment point and grasp the handles\nwith palms facing up. Lean back with your abs braced,\nbody straight, and arms extended in front of you. Curl\nyour body up to the handles.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nARM WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #26    BY BEN BRUNO\nWhat if y ou’v e got nothing—no barbells, no dumbbells, no bands, or a\nsuspension sy stem—but are still itching to pump up the guns? No\nproblem! So long as y ou can find an ov erhead pipe or crossbar that will\nsupport y our weight, and some lev el ground, y ou can work y our arms. In\nfact, by  following the workout below, y ou won’t just work y our arms; y ou’ll\nmake them grow.\nHOW IT WORKS\nUpper-body  training, in its simplest terms, is about pushing and pulling. Pair\nthe two mov ement patterns up and y ou’v e got a complete arm blast, and\nthat’s what we did here. You’ll finish with eccentric chinups, which are just\nnormal chins done with an extra-slow negativ e. This causes more muscle\ndamage in the biceps, leading to greater growth, and that’s alway s cool—\nev en if there’s no one else around to notice.\nDIRECTIONS\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. You’ll do\na set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed\nsets.\n1A CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\nSETS: 5 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nPlace your hands inside shoulder width and lower your\nbody until your chest is about an inch above the floor. To\nincrease the difficulty, elevate your feet on a bench or\nbox.\n1B CHINUP\nSETS: 5 REPS: 6–8 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the chinup bar at (or slightly inside) shoulder width,\nwith palms facing you. Pull yourself up until your chin is\nover the bar.\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nGet into pushup position and rest your forearms on the\nfloor, palms down. Keeping your core tight and your body\nin a straight line, extend your elbows so your arms are\nstraight.\n2B ECCENTRIC CHINUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 3 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp a chinup bar at shoulder width with palms facing\nyou and jump into the top position of a chinup. Take five\nseconds to lower yourself down to the hang position.\nThat’s one rep.\n \n13   BICEPS\nWhen you first start training, an equal amount of arm\nwork for the biceps and triceps is enough to stimulate\neven gains. But down the line, one muscle always seems\nto develop ahead of the other and you end up needing to\ngive the weaker one greater attention. If it’s your biceps,\nyou’re about to learn a bevy of new curls that will peak\nyour peaks fast and for a long time to come.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nBICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #27    BY HARRY CLAY\nWhen y ou’v e got total gy m access y ou need to take adv antage of it.\nHowev er, for the more zealous among us, there is a risk of\nov ertraining smaller body  parts—like biceps—in an attempt to sample all of a\ngy m’s wares. That’s why  y ou’ll want to keep ov erall v olume low for biceps,\nin comparison with bigger body  parts, like back and chest. The following\nworkout prov ides good v ariety  and intensity  while av oiding the common\npitfall of ov ertraining.\nHO W IT WO RKS You won’t be doing a lot of work, but ev ery  exercise was\ncarefully  chosen. Fattening the grip on dumbbell curls requires more tension\nfrom y our hands and forearms to hoist the weight, and this transfers to y our\nbiceps. The rarely  seen behind-the-back cable curl puts the biceps at an\nespecially  tough mechanical disadv antage, which forces y ou to ov ercome a\nlot of resistance as y ou contract them from a stretched position. The EZ-bar\npreacher curl finishes the workout with the strictest possible mov ement.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises at the end of an upper-body  workout\nonce per week.\n1 FAT-GRIP HAMMER CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 REST: 60 SEC.\nSelect two dumbbells and wrap towels around each\nhandle to thicken it. Another option is to use rubber-grip\nsleeves like Fat Gripz (available at fatgripz.com) or\nGrip4orce (shown below, grip4orce.com). Keeping your\nupper arms stationary at your sides and your palms facing,\ncurl the weights.\n2 BEHIND-THE-BACK CABLE CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–12 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach a D-handle to the low pulley of a cable machine,\ngrasp the handle in your left hand, and step forward\n(away from the machine) until there is tension on the\ncable and your arm is drawn slightly behind your body.\nStagger your feet so your right leg is in front. Curl the\nhandle but do not allow your elbow to point forward.\n3 EZ-BAR PREACHER CURL\nSETS: 2 REPS: 8–10 REST: 60 SEC.\nSit at a preacher bench and adjust the height so that\nyour armpits touch the top of the bench. Grasp an EZ-\ncurl bar at shoulder width with arms extended (but allow\na slight bend at the elbows). Curl the bar, keeping the\nbacks of your arms against the bench. Take three\nseconds to lower the bar back down.\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY\nBICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #28    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nThe biceps are small muscles that aren’t designed to handle a lot of\nweight, but they  do respond well to high reps, short rest periods, and\nmultiple angles. With only  a barbell loaded with a modest amount of weight\nand some earnest effort, y ou can build a solid pair of biceps muscles without\nov ertaxing y our biceps tendons.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout starts with a rev erse curl—the weakest grip\ny ou can curl with because y our palms are facing down. It gradually\nprogresses y ou to curls in stronger positions so that y ou can use the heav iest\nweights possible and keep y our intensity  up ev en as fatigue sets in. A nd\n“fatigue” is putting it mildly . Twenty  reps per set will hav e y our arms in\nagony , and then y ou’ll finish them with ladder sets—conv entional curls done\nfor more reps in each successiv e set until y ou’re doing 50 with just the bar.\nBy  that point, that’s all the weight y ou’ll be able to lift.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete each exercise in turn. Hold the top of each repetition\nfor one second and take two or three seconds to lower each rep.\n1 REVERSE CURL\nSETS: 1 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the bar overhand at whatever width is comfortable.\nKeeping your upper arms against your sides, curl the bar.\n2 WIDE-GRIP CURL\nSETS: 1 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the bar with hands wider than shoulder width—if\nyou’re using an Olympic bar, your pinkies should be on the\noutside knurling. Perform curls.\n3 CLOSE-GRIP CURL\nSETS: 1 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nCurl with your hands inside shoulder width, in the middle\nof the bar.\n4 CONVENTIONAL CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20, 30, 40, 50 REST: 60 SEC.\nPlace three 5-pound plates on each side of the bar, hands\nat shoulder width, and perform 20 reps. That’s one set.\nThen take off one plate from each side. Perform 30 reps.\nUnload another plate from each side and do 40 reps.\nFinally, remove the last set of plates and do 50 reps with\njust the empty bar.\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL-\nONLY BICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #29    BY C.J.MURPHY, M.F.S.\nYou might think that cheating on an exercise is only  cheating y our\nmuscles out of the best possible stimulus, but then how do y ou explain\nall the guy s with mountainous biceps slinging dumbbells to their shoulders on\ncurls? While we wouldn’t recommend making bad form a staple in y our\nworkouts, we’ll admit that sometimes it helps to break the rules, and with this\ndumbbell-only  routine, we’ll teach y ou how to cheat to win.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout starts with strict dumbbell curls. Since y ou’ll\nbe fresh, y ou should hav e no trouble giv ing each set y our utmost focus, using\nonly  the strength in y our biceps to complete y our reps. The drag curl follows—\nanother mov ement that relies on precise form and prev ents y our shoulders or\nback from assisting. Later, y ou can loosen up, doing curls again but this time\nwith intentional cheating. A t this point, y ou’ll be tired and unable to execute\nreps with perfect technique any way , so y ou’ll get a little help from y our hips\nto power through y our sticking point. Your biceps will still be working hard,\nand with most of y our workout accomplished, all y ou need do now is top\nthem off with blood to ensure the greatest growth.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all the prescribed sets for one exercise before\nmov ing on to the next.\n1 CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15, 12, 8, 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing\nyour sides. Keep your weight on your heels and lean\nforward slightly. Without letting your upper arms drift\nforward, curl the weights, rotating your wrists outward so\nthat your palms face you in the top position. Hold the top\nfor a moment and squeeze your biceps. Lower the\nweights back down and flex your triceps hard in the\nbottom position (your arms should end up slightly behind\nyour body). Increase the weight gradually each set.\n2 DRAG CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nPerform as you would the conventional dumbbell curl, but\nstand tall and drive your elbows back as you curl so the\nhead of each dumbbell touches the front of your body\nthroughout the rep. (Keep your palms facing up the\nwhole time.) It should look as though you’re dragging the\nweights up along your torso.\n3 HAMMER CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15–20 REST: 60 SEC.\nPerform as you did the conventional dumbbell curl but\nkeep your palms facing your sides throughout.\n4 CHEAT CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: SEE BELOW REST: 60 SEC.\nChoose the heaviest dumbbells you think you can curl,\nand perform as you did the conventional dumbbell curl,\nbut use momentum from your hips to power through the\nsticking point (halfway up, when the weights are most\ndifficult to lift). Do not lean back as you lift, but get into a\nrhythm where you rock your torso forward and then\nextend your hips to complete each rep. Stop each set\none rep shy of total failure.\nTHE BEST BAND-ONLY\nBICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #30    BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S.\nIt was once thought that the pump was just a cosmetic side effect of\nlifting weights, but it’s actually  an integral part of the muscle-building\nprocess. Performing reps creates tension in the muscles that, to some degree,\npinches off the v eins that take blood out of them while the arteries that\ndeliv er blood to the muscles continue unobstructed. So the muscles fill up with\nblood faster than they  can be cleared of it. This “cell swelling” stretches the\nmuscle cell membranes, sending the body  the message that the muscles aren’t\nbig enough to handle the blood flow to them.\nBands create enormous tension throughout a muscle’s\nentire range of motion, and yet the tension is easily\nadjusted depending on how you stand or position your\nbody. This makes them great tools for pumping up your\nbiceps.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout is designed for use with two or more bands,\nbut if y ou hav e only  one, y ou can perform any  of the curls one arm at a\ntime. O n the high-rep, high-speed curls, keep y our stance narrow (inside\nshoulder width) and adjust it as necessary  to complete all y our reps in one\nset.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all the prescribed sets for one exercise before\nmov ing on to the next.\n1 HIGH-SPEED CURL\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 100 REST: 60 SEC.\nAnchor the band under your feet, holding the ends with\nboth hands at your sides. Resist your elbows moving\nforward as you perform curls as fast as you can. Keep\nyour body still.\n2 SIDE CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15–20 REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach two bands to sturdy objects at shoulder height\nthat face each other. Stand between them and hold an\nend in each hand. Raise your arms out 90 degrees with\nelbows extended—you should still feel some tension on\nthe band in this starting position. Curl the bands toward\nyour ears and hold the contracted position for two\nseconds.\n3 REVERSE CURL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 15–20 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach a band to a sturdy object in front of you and\nstand facing it. Hold the band in both hands and walk\nbackward, adding tension to the band. Curl the band\nquickly—your forearm should end up at 90 degrees or\ngreater to the floor. Hold the contracted position for two\nseconds.\n4 HIGH-SPEED CURL\nSETS: SEE BELOW REPS: 50 TOTAL REST: 60 SEC.\nRepeat the first exercise, but use a higher-tension band,\nor use a wider stance to increase the resistance on the\nband you have. Perform only 50 reps this time.\n \n14   TRICEPS\nMany guys unfairly focus on their biceps, thinking that the\nkey to bigger arms lies in doing more curls. The truth is\nthat the triceps make up most of the upper arm (two-\nthirds, in fact), and while they’re not as much fun to\npractice posing in the mirror as their neighbors to the\nnorth, they account for more impressive pipes when fully\ndeveloped.\nBigger, stronger triceps also play a key role in bench\npressing and assist on back exercises, so if you want to\nget your arm-training priorities straight, start with this\nchapter.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nTRICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #31    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nBecause the triceps are bigger muscles than the biceps, they  can take\nmore of a pounding and respond well to both heav y  weight and high\nreps. Tack on this routine to the end of an upper-body  workout to dev elop\ntriceps size and strength.\nHO W IT WO RKS The close-grip bench press is one of the all-time great\ntriceps builders because it lets y ou load heav y  weights that recruit all\nav ailable muscle fibers. A fterward, y ou’ll lighten up on the remaining exercises\nand go for a big pump, getting as many  reps as y ou can per set and limiting\ny our rest periods. Triceps extensions done on a decline put a stretch on y our\ntri’s that forces them to work harder than the conv entional v ersion, and band\npushdowns allow y ou to pump out reps fast without perfect form or elbow\nstrain.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as straight sets at the end of an upper-\nbody  workout once per week.\n1 CLOSE-GRIP BENCH PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8, 8, 8, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the bar with your index fingers on the inside edge\nof the knurling (the rough part of the bar). Arch your\nback so there’s space between your lower back and the\nbench. Pull the bar off the rack and lower it to your\nsternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your\nsides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet\nhard into the floor and press the bar back up. On your\nlast set, use half the weight and perform as many reps as\npossible.\n2 DECLINE TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 4 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 15 SEC.\nSet an adjustable bench to a slight decline (around 30\ndegrees) and lie on it with a dumbbell in each hand.

If y ou hav e an EZ-curl bar instead of or in addition to\na straight barbell as shown, feel free to use it as a substitute. It can reliev e\ndiscomfort of the elbows and wrists. You may  also perform the ly ing triceps\nextension and pullov er on a bench or similarly  elev ated surface in order to put\nmore of a stretch on the triceps.\n1 CLOSE-GRIP FLOOR PRESS\nSETS: 5 REPS: 12 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie on the floor and roll the barbell up to your chest or\nhave a partner hand it to you. Grasp the bar at about\nshoulder width and arch your back so there’s space\nbetween your lower back and the floor. Lower the bar to\nyour sternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to\nyour sides. When your triceps touch the floor (not your\nelbows), press the bar back up.\n2 LYING TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nPress the bar over your chest and then let your upper\narms drift back to about a 45-degree angle. Bend your\nelbows to lower the bar behind your head, and then\nextend them to return to the starting position. Keep your\nelbows in line with your wrists throughout.\n3 PULLOVER\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold the bar overhead with an overhand, shoulder-width\ngrip and lie back on the floor. Press the bar over your\nhead and then reach back over your head, bending your\nelbows only slightly. Continue until you feel a stretch in\nyour lats, and then pull the bar back over your chest,\nflexing your triceps as you go. Focus your mind on your\ntriceps and you’ll feel them engage more throughout the\nexercise.\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL-\nONLY TRICEPS WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #33    BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T.\nThe triceps is made up of three parts, hence the “tri”—apologies if this\ninsults y our intelligence.

Pull the bar out of the rack and lower it to your\nsternum, tucking your elbows about 45 degrees to your\nsides. When the bar touches your body, drive your feet\nhard into the floor and press the bar back up.\n5 CABLE CROSSOVER\nSETS: 7 REPS: 10 REST: 30–45 SECONDS\nStand between two facing cable stations with both\npulleys set midway between the top and bottom of the\nstation. Attach a D-handle to each pulley and hold one in\neach hand. Keep your elbows slightly bent and step\nforward so there’s tension on the cables. Flex your pecs\nas you bring your hands together out in front of your\nchest. Alternate stretching and flexing after each set.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nCHEST WORKOUT [option\nB]\nWORKOUT #40    BY HANY RAMBOD\nIf y ou’v e been working out for a while, this routine will probably\nremind y ou of some of the chest sessions y ou did in the early  day s.\nIt’s good, old-fashioned hard work and prov ides a lot of isolation of the pecs.\nIf y ou’v e gotten more scientific with y our training since and noticed fewer\ngains, this simple and direct approach may  be what y ou need to get growing\nagain.\nHO W IT WO RKS When a muscle contracts, the whole thing contracts. So\nwhen y ou hear trainers talking about exercises for the “upper” pecs and\n“inner” pecs, this isn’t entirely  accurate. Howev er, while the whole pectoralis\nmajor muscle is inv olv ed in any  kind of press, dip, or fly e motion, different\nparts of it are indeed emphasized depending on the angle of resistance. So\nwhile an incline dumbbell press will work the whole chest, it’s making the\nfibers that attach to y our clav icle work harder than the ones that attach to\ny our ribs.\nWe’ve given you exercises that work every part of the\nchest and with varying degrees of isolation. If you don’t\nnormally feel your pecs working on barbell presses, you’ll\nlove what dumbbell and machine work does for you.\nDIREC TIO NS Stop each set a rep or two short of failure.\nFeel free to combine the workout with Option A,\nshown previously. The two routines fit well together but\nshould be spaced three days apart.\n1 INCLINE DUMBBELL PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nSet an adjustable bench to a 30- to 45-degree angle and\nlie back on it with a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder\nlevel. Press the weights over your chest.\n2 HAMMER STRENGTH CHEST PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nUse a Hammer Strength flat-press machine if you can and\nadjust the seat so that both of your feet are flat on the\nfloor. Grasp the handles and press to a full lockout.\n3 DUMBBELL FLYE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nLie back on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand.\nKeep a slight bend in your elbows and spread your arms\nwide, lowering the weights until they’re even with your\nchest. Flex your pecs and lift the weights back to the\nstarting position.\n4 LOW-CABLE CROSSOVER\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nStand between two facing cable stations and attach a D-\nhandle to the low pulleys on each. With a handle in each\nhand and elbows slightly bent, raise your arms from waist\nheight to out in front of your chest, flexing your pecs as\nyou bring them together.\n5 DIP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60–90 SEC.\nSuspend yourself over the bars of a dip station and lower\nyour body until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. If\neight reps is too easy, add weight using a weighted belt\nor by holding a dumbbell between your feet.\nTHE BEST BARBELL-ONLY\nCHEST WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #41    BY JASON FERRUGGIA\nThere are three training methods that hav e prov en effectiv e for\nbuilding muscle: using heav y  weights, doing lots of reps, and lifting\nexplosiv ely . The first two are familiar to y ou, but y ou probably  hav en’t\nthought much about the third—known as speed work. C ombine all three and\ny our chest will hav e to grow.\nHO W IT WO RKS We want y ou to perform the classic bench press on a slight\nincline. Not only  is it safer for y our shoulders, but it also brings the pecs more\nstrongly  into the mov ement. The speed bench press is done light, but that\ndoesn’t mean easy . Light weights trav el faster, and y our goal should be to\nmake ev ery  rep mov e at warp speed. Explosiv e reps activ ate the most\npowerful muscle fibers and also help y ou ov ercome sticking points in y our\nbench press.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\nnext.\n1 LOW-INCLINE PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 6–8 REST: 90 SEC.\nSet an adjustable bench to an incline of no more than 30\ndegrees, or rest a flat bench on a weight plate or mat to\ntilt it slightly. Grasp the bar just outside shoulder width\nand arch your back so there’s space between your lower\nback and the bench. Pull the bar out of the rack and\nlower it to your sternum, tucking your elbows about 45\ndegrees to your sides. When the bar touches your body,\ndrive your feet hard into the floor and press the bar back\nup.\n2 SPEED BENCH PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC.\nBench press as described at left, but do so on a totally\nflat bench. Use 60% of your max. So if you think you can\nbench-press 250 pounds one time, perform your sets\nwith 150, exploding each rep off your chest as fast as you\ncan.\n3 LANDMINE PRESS\nSETS: 3 REPS: 8, 10, 15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nWedge the end of the barbell into a corner of the room\n(to avoid damage to the walls, you may have to wrap a\ntowel around it). Load the opposite end with weight and\ngrasp it toward the end of the sleeve with your left hand.\nStagger your stance so your right leg is in front. Press the\nbar straight overhead.\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL-\nONLY CHEST WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #42    BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S.\nC hest training is alway s done with some kind of bench. You need\nsomething to brace y our back while y ou press or fly e, and hold y ou in\nposition while y our pecs get a stretch. But what if y ou don’t hav e a bench\nhandy , which is a definite possibility  in a small hotel gy m, or y our garage,\nwhere all y ou’v e inv ested in so far is some selectorized dumbbells? Here’s\nhow to get a chest workout so effectiv e y ou won’t ev en miss the bench.\nHO W IT WO RKS Lacking something to stabilize y our upper body  just means\ny ou’ll hav e to do it y ourself, which is fine—the exercises will be harder, but\nthey ’ll activ ate more stabilizer muscles in the chest, back, shoulders, and core.\nReally , y our training won’t seem that different. You can still press like y ou’re\nbenching, but y ou’ll do it on the floor. You can still do fly es, but y ou’ll do them\nfrom pushup position (y ou’ll see). The plate pressout, howev er, will likely  be\na brand-new challenge for y ou. You’ll be amazed how strong a contraction\ny ou can get in y our pecs without heav y  weights or a bench to lie on.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\nnext.\n1 FLOOR PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie on the floor with a dumbbell in each hand. Your palms\nshould face each other and your triceps should be resting\non the floor, but not your elbows. Explosively press the\ndumbbells up. Lower them until only your triceps touch\nthe floor. Pause for a moment and then begin the next\nrep. Increase the weight gradually each set.\n2 PRONE FLYE\nSETS: 4 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 60 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand and get into pushup\nposition on the floor with palms facing each other. Spread\nyour arms apart as in a normal dumbbell flye and lower\nyour body until you feel a stretch in your chest, then\nsqueeze the dumbbells and bring your hands back to\npushup position. Keep your abs and glutes braced and\nyour back flat throughout. If you’re using plate-loaded\ndumbbells, you may be able to roll the weight plates on\nthe floor during the flye. Otherwise, you can place a\ntowel under each dumbbell to facilitate sliding. If this is\ntoo difficult, perform the exercise on your knees.\n3 PULLOVER\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor and hold one dumbbell\noverhead with both hands. Press the weight over your\nchest and then reach back over your head, bending your\nelbows only slightly. Continue until you feel a stretch in\nyour lats, and then pull the dumbbell back over your\nchest. Take a deep breath every time you lower the\ndumbbell behind you.\n4 PLATE PRESSOUT\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–20 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold a pair of light weight plates together, smooth side\nout, between your palms right in front of your chest. You\nshould look like you’re praying. Squeeze the plates\ntogether, focusing on your chest, and press them out in\nfront of you until your arms are extended. Flare your lats\nand pull the weights back to your chest. Complete your\nreps and then, on the second set, press the weights\ndownward from your chest at a 45-degree angle. On the\nthird set, press them upward at a 45-degree angle.\nTHE BEST SUSPENSION-\nTRAINER CHEST\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #43    BY BEN BRUNO\nWhen a guy  wants to get a big chest, he tends to make the classic\nmistake of training only  his chest—or training it twice as often and as\nhard as any  other body  part. Ev en if shirt-popping pecs is all y ou’re interested\nin, y ou’ll get faster results if y ou train the rest of the body , too, particularly\nthe upper back and shoulders. The routine at right addresses all three.\nHO W IT WO RKS The more muscle y ou add to one side of y our body , the\nmore y ou need to add to the opposite side in order to keep the balance. If\ny ou don’t, the body  will ev entually  forbid muscle growth to the area that has\ngrown out of whack, because it doesn’t want to risk the injury . This is one of\nthe most common and easily  prev entable way s to plateau.\nYou’ll target your chest very specifically in this routine\nwith moves like the three-way flye, which is borrowed\nfrom gymnastics training. The pec activation is like nothing\nyou’ve tried before, so prepare to be sore. However, to\nkeep your upper back and shoulders growing in\nconjunction with your pecs, we’ve thrown in some rows,\nreverse flyes, external rotations, and face pulls. Think of it\nas a way to build your chest without breaking it.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating\nsets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for\nall the prescribed sets.\n1A 3-WAY FLYE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 3 REST: 90 SEC.\nAttach a suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object\nand lengthen the straps to a point at which you would to\ndo pushups. Grasp the handles and get into pushup\nposition with hands under your shoulders. Your entire\nbody should be straight and your core braced. Bring your\narms out to your sides as if you were giving someone a\nbear hug. Lower your body until you feel a stretch in your\nchest and then bring your arms together again. That’s\none rep of the flye. Perform three reps.\nNow, from the starting position, open your arms but keep\nyour elbows bent so that the move looks like a\ncombination of a pushup and a flye. Press yourself back\nup. That’s one rep of the bent-arm flye. Perform three\nreps.\nFrom there, return to the starting position and perform\npushups on the handles. Perform three reps.\nAll of the above equals one set.\n1B INVERTED ROW\nSETS: 2 REPS: 12 REST: 90 SEC.\nHold the handles and lean back with arms extended so\nthat your body is supported by the trainer and only your\nfeet are on the floor. Brace your core and hold your body\nin a straight line. (The lower you set the handles, the\nharder the exercise; you can elevate your feet on\nsomething to make it even harder.) Row your body up\nuntil your chest is by your hands and your back is fully\ncontracted. Rotate your wrists as you row your palms up\nin the end position.\n2A PUSHUP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 90 SEC.\nGrasp the handles and get into pushup position with\nhands under your shoulders. Your entire body should be\nstraight and your core braced. Lower your body until your\nchest is between the handles.\n2B 3-WAY FINISHER\nSETS: 2 REPS: 5 REST: 120 SEC.\nGrasp the handles and lean back away from the trainer’s\nattachment point so that your weight is on your heels\nand your body is 45–50 degrees to the floor. Allow your\narms to extend in front of you. Squeeze your shoulder\nblades together and draw your arms back until they’re 90\ndegrees out to your sides. (Keep a slight bend in your\nelbows.) That’s one rep of the reverse flye. Perform five\nreps.\nNow, from the start position of the reverse flye, draw\nyour upper arms back with your elbows bent 90 degrees\nand knuckles facing the ceiling. Your upper body should\nmake a W shape. That’s one rep of the external rotation.\nPerform five reps.\nFrom there, return to the starting position with arms\nextended and pull your hands to your forehead, twisting\nyour palms to face in front of you as you pull. That’s one\nface pull. Perform five reps.\nAll of the above equals one set.\nTHE BEST MEDICINE-\nBALL CHEST WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #44    BY NICK TUMMINELLO\nThis workout takes only  10 minutes and works the triceps hard in\naddition to the chest. If y ou don’t hav e a medicine ball, a firm soccer\nor basketball will work.\nHO W IT WO RKS A  medicine ball is so v ersatile it doesn’t ev en hav e to\nmov e and it can still help y ou build muscle. You don’t hav e to throw, catch, or\nev en lift it, but merely  use it to balance on. Working to keep it stable will\nwork y our own stabilizing muscles in y our core, and using it for pushup\nv ariations will light up y our pecs and triceps.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each\nback to back without rest. Do at least fiv e reps per mov e and try  to add one\nrep each time y ou repeat the workout. C omplete one to three circuits, resting\nthree to fiv e minutes between each.\n1 LOCK-OFF\nSETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nGet into pushup position resting your left hand on the\nmedicine ball and right hand on the floor. Lower your\nbody until your chest is just above the floor and then\npush back up. At the top, reach up with your opposite\nhand and slap your chest.\n2 DROP N’ POP\nSETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 0 SEC.\nPlace both hands on the ball and get into pushup\nposition. Quickly let go of the ball and spread your hands\nout to shoulder width on the floor. When you feel your\nchest touch the ball, push yourself up fast so your hands\ncome off the floor and land on the ball again.\n3 CLOSE-GRIP PUSHUP\nSETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 0 SEC.\nWith both hands on the ball, perform pushups. Squeeze\nthe ball hard throughout the set and keep your abs\nbraced.\n4 CROSSOVER PUSHUP\nSETS: 1–3 REPS: 5 OR MORE REST: 3–5 MINUTES\nPerform a pushup with one hand on the ball, then quickly\nswitch hands and do another rep.\nTHE BEST BAND-ONLY\nCHEST WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #45    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nO ne of the best way s to make a muscle grow is to make it stretch at\nthe bottom of a rep. This helps recruit muscle fibers and signals the\nnerv ous sy stem that it needs to contract hard to prev ent any  further\nstretching, which could cause injury . Bands are great for feeling a stretch on\nchest exercises and, combined with pushups, can pump y our pecs up fast.\nHO W IT WO RKS The chest can get worked in ev ery  way , ev en when\nheav y  weights aren’t av ailable. The ply o pushup recruits some of the\nstrongest pec fibers, and band fly es and pushups stretch and exhaust them\nfrom a v ariety  of angles. Be prepared to walk out of the gy m so pumped that\ny our chest passes through the doorway  long before y our chin does.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as\nsupersets. So y ou’ll do one set of A  and then B before resting. C omplete all\nthe prescribed sets for the pair before mov ing on. The last exercise is done\nwith conv entional straight sets.\n1A PLYO PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6–8 REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform pushups, but explode upward on each rep so\nthat your hands leave the floor and you can clap before\nlanding. When you land, go immediately into the next\nrep. Stop the set as soon as your movement slows down,\neven if it’s before six reps are completed.\n1B WIDE-GRIP PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 20 REST: 90–120 SEC.\nPlace your hands wider than shoulder width and perform\npushups.\n2A BAND-RESISTED PUSHUP W/FEET\nELEVATED\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8–10 REST: 0 SEC.\nGrasp an end of the band in one hand and wrap it around\nyour back. Pin both hands to the floor with the ends of\nthe band in your palms. Rest your feet on a box, bench,\nor mats so that your body forms a straight line parallel to\nthe floor. Perform pushups.\n2B BAND-RESISTED FLYE\nSETS: 4 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 90 SEC.\nAttach a band to a sturdy object at shoulder height and\nrepeat with another adjacent to it. Or wrap a band\naround the object and hold an end in each hand. Step\nforward so that your arms are drawn back 90 degrees to\nyour sides and you feel a stretch in your pecs. Keeping\nyour elbows slightly bent, bring your hands together in\nfront of your chest as if you were giving someone a bear\nhug.\n3 PUSHUP\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 150 TOTAL\nPerform 150 total reps, taking as many sets as you need\nand resting as little as possible between them. If pushups\nare easy for you, begin using the band for resistance and\nthen get rid of it as fatigue sets in and finish your reps\nwith body weight alone.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nCHEST WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #46    BY BEN BRUNO\nThe chest is probably  the easiest muscle group to build up when y ou\nhav e no equipment. A ll y ou really  need is the trusty  pushup to do it.\nToo many  guy s get bored of pushups and think they  can graduate to the\nbench press, but if y ou can’t do 100 reps in a handful of sets, y our pecs aren’t\nas strong as they  could be and y ou’re missing out on gains that are easily\ngotten through body -weight training alone.\nHO W IT WO RKS This workout is all about the pushup—doing it and helping\ny ou do it better in future training sessions. You’ll work to get 100 total reps in\nas few sets as possible, and then strengthen y our triceps and core directly .\nThese muscles support y our ability  to do pushups, so the stronger they  are,\nthe more pushups y ou can crank out and the bigger y our chest will get.\nSimple enough.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the pushups as conv entional straight sets. Perform the\nexercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets. So y ou’ll do a set of\nA , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for all the prescribed sets.\n1 PUSHUP\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 100 TOTAL REST: AS NEEDED\nPerform pushups, but go one rep shy of failure on each\nset and try to complete 100 reps in as few sets as\npossible. When you can do it in fewer than five sets,\nincrease the number to 120 total reps.\n2A TRICEPS EXTENSION\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12 REST: 90 SEC.\nStart in pushup position and then rest your forearms on\nthe floor with palms down.

Hold the position with abs\nbraced.\n \n17   SHOULDERS\nThe shoulder joints are especially mobile and, as a result,\nare prime candidates for injury, especially if you bench\nheavy. Our shoulder workouts take into account\nweaknesses and imbalances you’re probably already\nsuffering (whether you know it or not) to prevent you\nfrom hurting something that might take months to fix. If\nyour shoulders already bother you, you’ll find that some of\nour exercises allow you to keep building them up without\naggravating any injury, and may even correct the problem\nalong the way.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nSHOULDER WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #47    BY LEE BOYCE, C.P.T.\nWith access to all that a gy m has to offer, y ou can work y our\nshoulders from a v ariety  of angles and, while y ou’re at it, rep\nschemes. Lower reps (six and under) with heav y  weights result in the best\nstrength gains. Medium reps (8–12) with moderate loads exhaust the muscles,\nsparking gains in sheer size. High reps (15 or more) train endurance, but in so\ndoing hit a different set of muscle fibers that aren’t tapped by  the other rep\nranges. The shoulder routine here takes adv antage of all three ranges to\nleav e no stone unturned in y our journey  for bigger delts.\nHO W IT WO RKS The exercises are organized into trisets—three mov es done\nback to back. The first lift in each triset is done heav y , the second is medium,\nand the third is light but for high reps. C ombine the v ariety  of the exercises,\nthe rep ranges, and the fast pace and there’s little more y ou can do to shock\ny our delts into new growth.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the first triset (marked as “A ,” “B,” and “C ”) in\nsequence without rest in between. A fterward, rest two to three minutes, and\nrepeat for four total trisets. Then go on to the second triset and complete it in\nthe same fashion.\n1A OVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6 REST: 0 SEC.\nSet the bar up in a squat rack or cage, and grasp it just\noutside shoulder width. Take the bar off the rack and\nhold it at shoulder level with your forearms perpendicular\nto the floor. Squeeze the bar and brace your abs. Press\nthe bar overhead, pushing your head forward and\nshrugging your traps as the bar passes your face.\n1B STANDING DUMBBELL FLYE\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand by your sides. Without\nshrugging, use your upper body to swing the weights up\na few inches. Your arms and torso will form an upside\ndown V shape. Think of it as a lateral raise with\nmomentum but without full range of motion.\n1C FACE PULL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 25 REST: 120–180 SEC.\nAttach a rope handle to the top pulley of a cable station.\nGrasp an end in each hand with palms facing each other.\nStep back to place tension on the cable.

The deltoid muscles\nsimply  don’t need a lot of training v ariety  if y ou’re regularly  exploding big\nweights off the ground and ov erhead. This workout incorporates weightlifting\nmov ements to build y our delts, but don’t be disappointed if other muscles\nhappen to get bigger and stronger, too.\nHO W IT WO RKS The clean and press is frequently  called the most functional\nexercise of all, because it works ev ery  last muscle in y our body  to perform a\nbasic mov ement pattern—picking something up and raising it ov erhead. The\nhigh pull isn’t done with heav y  weights, but the speed y ou perform it at\nrecruits all the biggest and strongest muscle fibers. Note that we’re also\nhav ing y ou perform it with an extra-wide snatch grip. This makes the mov e\neasier on y our shoulder joints, so y ou don’t inadv ertently  break them while\ny ou’re try ing to build the muscle that surrounds them.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for the clean and press and then mov e on to\nthe snatch-grip high pull.\n1 CLEAN AND PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6–8 REST: 90 SEC.\nStand with feet shoulder width. Keeping your lower back\narched, bend your hips back to lower your torso and\ngrasp the bar with hands shoulder width. Extend your\nhips to lift the bar off the floor. When it gets past your\nknees, jump and shrug the bar so that momentum raises\nit and you catch it at shoulder level. Brace your abs and\nstand tall. Press the bar straight overhead.\n2 SNATCH-GRIP HIGH PULL\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6 REST: 90 SEC.\nSet up as you did for the clean and press, but grasp the\nbar with hands double shoulder width. Explode the bar\nupward until it’s at chest level and your upper arms are\nparallel to the floor. Try to push your chest out as you lift\nthe bar and contract your upper back completely.\nTHE BEST BAND-ONLY\nSHOULDER WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #49    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nThe knock on lateral raises done with free weights is that the first half\nof the mov ement is easy . Your shoulders only  start to really  kick in\ntoward the top, when y our arms are extended out from y our sides. Bands,\nhowev er, put tension on y our muscles throughout the whole mov ement and\nmake it harder at the end range of motion. If y ou thought bands were just\nmaking the best of a bad situation (no free weights), this workout will change\ny our mind—and fry  y our shoulders.\nHO W IT WO RKS We’v e taken conv entional free-weight shoulder exercises\nlike the ov erhead press, lateral raise, and shrug and applied bands to them.\nYou’ll hav e to fight the resistance on each mov ement as it increases, which\nheightens the demand on y our muscles and also teaches y ou to lift fast. If\ny ou can’t explode y our reps, y ou won’t be able to lock them out, so y ou hav e\nto do y our sets deliberately  and with power; and power training recruits the\nbiggest muscle fibers.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises marked with letters in sequence. For\ninstance, for pairs of “A ” and “B” exercises, y ou’ll do a set of A  and then B\nbefore resting. Repeat until all sets are completed. For exercises 2A , 2B, and\n2C , perform all three in order before resting and then repeat. The first exercise\n(ov erhead press) is done as straight sets.\n1 OVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6–8 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on the middle of a band (or use two, depending\non the length) and hold an end in each hand at shoulder\nlevel. Stand tall with glutes and abs braced, and press\noverhead.\n2A LATERAL RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 0 SEC.\nStep on the free end of each band with the opposite\nfoot so the bands form an X in front of your body. Raise\nyour arms 90 degrees out to the sides until your upper\narms are parallel to the floor.\n2B FRONT RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand on bands and hold the opposite ends.

The imbalance results from sitting at desks with poor posture\nfor hours on end and is compounded by  most gy mgoers’ preference for bench\npresses ov er rear-delt exercises.\nThis workout forces your rear delts to work harder than\nthey ever have, and you’ll need only your body weight to\ndo it.\nHO W IT WO RKS The Y raise and rear-delt fly e may  be familiar to y ou, as\nthey ’re often performed with dumbbells. But a suspension trainer makes them\nmore effectiv e because y ou’re lifting y our body  weight as opposed to tiny\n(and possibly  pink) hand weights. O bv iously , this activ ates more muscle, and\nmakes y ou look more like a gy mnast than an old lady  in her first personal\ntraining session.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all the sets for one mov e before going on to the\nnext.\n1 PIKE PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8–12 REST: 90 SEC.\nAttach the suspension trainer to a sturdy object\noverhead, and lower the foot cradles to about knee\nheight (you want your body to be in a straight line when\nyou rest your feet in them). Get into pushup position\nwith your feet in the cradles and hands placed shoulder\nwidth on the floor. Keeping your abs braced, lower your\nbody until your chest is just above the floor and then\npush back up. Now bend your hips and raise them into\nthe air until your torso is vertical. Straighten your body\nagain. That’s one rep.\n2 Y RAISE\nSETS: 2 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nGrasp the handles and stand with feet about shoulder\nwidth. Lean back 45–60 degrees, so your body is\nsupported by the trainer, and brace your abs. Raise your\narms up and out into a Y shape with palms facing\nforward. Your body will become more vertical, but don’t\nallow your shoulders to lose tension at the top of the\nmovement. Your weight will shift from the back foot to\nthe front foot.\n3 REAR-DELT FLYE\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nShorten the length of the handles, but stand as you did\nfor the Y raise. Open your arms out to your sides with\npalms facing in until your shoulder blades are squeezed\ntogether. Allow a little bend in your elbows.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nSHOULDER WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #51    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nMuscles need tension to grow, and whether they  get it from weights\nor y our own body  doesn’t matter. When the tension is strong enough,\nand lasts long enough, y our muscles will be forced to adapt by  growing bigger\nand stronger. This workout uses trisets to supply  the time and some brutally\nchallenging body -weight mov ements to induce the tension.\nHO W IT WO RKS Trisets are tough. You do one exercise and then another\nand then another before y ou get to rest. This keeps y our shoulders working a\nlong time, and with these exercises, they ’re working to support y our body  in\nawkward positions where y ou’re lifting large percentages of y our own weight.\nYou won’t miss y our dumbbells. A t the end of each triset is a stretch, which\nencourages blood flow to the muscles, resulting in more nutrient deliv ery  that\nhelps them grow.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform exercises 1A , 1B, and 1C  as a triset. So y ou’ll\ncomplete one set of A , then B, and then C  before resting. Repeat until all the\nprescribed sets are done, and then do exercises 2A , 2B, and 2C  in the same\nfashion. Exercise 3 is performed with conv entional straight sets.\n1A HINDU PUSHUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 0 SEC.\nGet into pushup position. Push your hands into the floor\nto drive your weight back so your hips rise into the air.\nYour back should be straight and your head behind your\nhands. Lower your body in an arcing motion so that your\nchest scoops downward and nearly scrapes the floor.\nContinue moving forward as you press your body up so\nyour torso is vertical and your legs are straight and nearly\non the floor. That’s one rep.\n1B Y TO W RAISE\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 0 SEC.\nLie facedown on the floor and raise your arms overhead\nand out to your sides a bit with thumbs facing the ceiling.\nYour arms should form a Y shape with your body. Hold for\na second. From there, bend your elbows and draw your\narms back until your elbows are near your sides and your\nbody now forms a W shape. Hold for a second. Think\nabout doing a pullup—you’re performing the same\nmovement on the floor.\n1C SHOULDER STRETCH\nSETS: 4 REPS: HOLD FOR 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 30 SEC.\nPlace the inner side of your forearm against a doorframe\nwith your elbow bent 90 degrees.

Your hands, arms, and head should\nbe in a straight line. Lower your body until your head\nnearly touches the floor between your hands and then\npress back up.\n2B DIP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 REST: 0 SEC.\nRest the palms of your hands on a bench or chair, and, if\navailable, place your heels on another elevated object in\nfront of you so your legs are suspended. Lower your body\nuntil your upper arms are parallel to the floor.\n2C LAT STRETCH\nSETS: 4 REPS/TIME: HOLD FOR 30 SEC. (EACH SIDE) REST: 30 SEC.\nGrasp a doorknob or other sturdy object at approximately\nthe same level and bend your hips back, keeping your\nlower back flat, until your arm is in line with your torso.\nRock your hips side to side so you feel a stretch in your lat\nmuscle.\n3 LATERAL PLANK WALK\nSETS: 4 REPS: 10 SHUFFLES (EACH WAY) REST: 60 SEC.\nGet into pushup position and simultaneously move your\nleft hand over your right while your right leg steps out\nwide. Now bring the right hand out and walk your left\nfoot in to a normal pushup footing. That’s one shuffle.\nContinue “walking” for 10 shuffles and then walk in the\nopposite direction to get back to the starting position.\nKeep your core braced and your hips level at all times.\nTHE BEST DUMBBELL-\nONLY SHOULDER\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #52    BY C.J. MURPHY, M.F.S.\nYour av erage trainer can think of only  two way s to work y our\nshoulders with dumbbells—presses and raises. We’v e got a third to add\nto the mix, and this three-pronged attack can build shoulders as round and\ndense as cannonballs.\nHO W IT WO RKS The first exercise, a neutral-grip ov erhead press, is the\nsafest way  to do any  pressing mov ement. If y ou’v e backed off of shoulder\nwork in the past because it hurt to execute, relief can be as simple as turning\ny our palms to face each other. In this position, y our upper-arm bones can\nglide through the shoulder joints without risk of impingement.\nYou’ll follow this up with a variety of shoulder raises,\nending with a crucifix hold, in which you keep your arms\nraised for time. This is an exercise popular among\nstrongman competitors, whose shoulders are the size of\npumpkins. Finally, the workout ends with seated dumbbell\ncleans. If you’ve ever done power cleans, you know what\nexploding a weight up from the floor to shoulder level can\ndo for your shoulders, and this variation isolates them\nmore. It’s as simple to do as it sounds: heave the weights\nup. Brute force builds big shoulders.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\nnext.\n1 NEUTRAL-GRIP OVERHEAD PRESS\nSETS: 5 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level with palms\nfacing each other and elbows pointing forward. Brace\nyour core and press the weights straight overhead. At\nthe top, shrug your shoulders and hold for a second.\n2 RAISE COMPLEX\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: SEE BELOW\nHold dumbbells at your sides with palms facing you. Raise\nthe weights up in front of you to shoulder level with\nthumbs pointing up. Complete 12–15 reps and then raise\nthe weights out to your sides 90 degrees (bend your\nelbows a bit as you lift). Complete your reps and then\nswitch to a lighter pair of dumbbells. Raise them out to\nyour sides and up to ear level with straight arms and\nthumbs pointing up. Hold this position 30 seconds.\nSqueeze your glutes to help support you.\n3 SEATED DUMBBELL CLEAN\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nHold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on the edge of a\nbench. Keeping your lower back flat, lean forward.\nExplosively straighten your body and shrug the weights so\nyour arms rise. Allow the momentum to flip your wrists so\nyou catch the weights at shoulder level.\n \n18   BACK\nGetting your mind into back training isn’t as easy as it is\nwith the chest and arms. Because you can’t see your\nback, it is tougher to visualize how it is working, and so\nyou must learn to focus on the feeling of your muscles\ncontracting with each rep. Finding the right training\nimplements for your needs can help with this. If dumbbells\ndon’t work for you, bands might, because their\naccommodating resistance makes reps feel different than\nwith free weights. It’s possible that simple pullups do the\ntrick, because you’re able to imagine your hands as hooks\ndesigned to allow your lats to move your body up and\ndown. Whatever may work best for you, we’ve got it\ncovered here, so you can build your back with the same\nintensity you do your arms.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nBACK WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #53    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nDeadlifts are one of our fav orite exercises at Men’s Fitness. They  raise\ntestosterone, jack up y our metabolism, and add slabs of muscle all\nov er y our body —and to y our back in particular. Deadlifts are the centerpiece\nof this routine, and just when they ’v e worn y ou out, the work really  begins.\nHO W IT WO RKS The deadlift is a strenuous exercise and usually  requires\nplenty  of rest between sets. No such luck here. You’ll keep y our rest periods\nshort and squeak out as many  reps as y ou can to exhaust y our back\ncompletely . Then y ou’ll go on to chinups—the ultimate lat builder—ly ing lateral\nraises, rows, and back extensions. To tell y ou the truth, the deadlift alone will\nleav e y our back sore the next morning. The rest of the exercises just keep it\nthat way  longer.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as\nsupersets. So y ou’ll do one set of A  and then B before resting. C omplete all\nthe prescribed sets for the pair before mov ing on. The first exercise is done as\nconv entional straight sets.\n1 DEADLIFT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 5, AS MANY AS POSSIBLE REST: 15 SEC.\nStand with feet hip width and bend your hips back to\ngrasp the bar just outside your knees. Keeping your back\nflat, extend your hips to stand up, pulling the bar up\nalong your legs to lockout. Perform three warmup sets of\nfive reps using 20%, 40%, and 60% of your deadlift max,\nrespectively. (If you don’t know how much you can lift\nfor one rep on the deadlift, estimate it conservatively.)\nRest 90 seconds between these warmups. When you’re\ndone, perform one set with 70–75% of your max for five\nreps and then rest 15 seconds. Perform three more sets\nof as many reps as possible, resting 15 seconds between\nsets. You may get only one or two reps on these last\nthree sets, and that’s OK. End a set if you suspect your\nform might be compromised.\n2A CHINUP\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6–8 REST: 0 SEC.\nHang from a chinup bar with hands shoulder width.

Now explosively extend your hips as if\njumping while at the same time shrugging your shoulders\nand pulling the bar straight up in front of your torso. As\nthe bar reaches chest level, bend your elbows and flip\nyour wrists to catch the bar at shoulder level, palms face\nthe ceiling. Bend your hips and knees as you catch the\nbar to absorb the impact.\n2 LANDMINE ONE-ARM ROW\nSETS: 3 REPS: 12, 10, 8 (EACH SIDE) REST: 90 SEC.\nWedge the end of the bar into a corner (you may have\nto wrap it in a towel to protect the walls). Face away\nfrom the corner and hold the barbell behind the sleeve\n(where you load the weights) with your right hand.\nStagger your legs so that your left leg is forward and,\nkeeping your lower back flat, bend at the hips until your\ntorso is about parallel to the floor.

In this routine, we train it both directly  and indirectly  to\nfortify  it for all future workouts, while training y our lats hard at the same\ntime.\nHO W IT WO RKS You’ll spend most of the workout staring at the floor. That’s\nbecause y ou’ll be bent ov er holding the arch in y our lower back while giv ing\ny our main attention to y our lats and rear delts. This will teach these muscles\nto act sy nergistically  and keep y our spine protected for future heav y  rows,\ndeadlifts, and so on. The stronger y our lower back, the more weight y ou can\nhandle on most other exercises (not just for back), and greater loads mean\nbigger muscles.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as\nsupersets.

Well, y our muscles work like a chain, too. The smaller ones are\nweaker than the big ones and, thus, are more likely  to “break,” limiting the\nforce the prime mov ers can produce and reducing the effectiv eness of an\nexercise and y our workout. If y our back has stopped growing, it’s time to\nstart looking at the chain of muscles behind it, link by  link.\nHO W IT WO RKS O n any  back exercise, the biceps and the rear head of the\ndeltoid can’t help but get inv olv ed. A fter all, they ’re pulling muscles too. But\nbecause they ’re smaller and weaker than y our lats, they  tend to hold back\nthe weight y ou can use or the reps y ou can perform on exercises like rows\nand pullups. The routine at right incorporates shoulder and arm work,\nstrengthening these areas so that they  don’t giv e out before y our back does.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the first two exercises as conv entional straight sets.\nPerform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating sets.

Used sparingly ,\nthey ’re a smart way  to increase intensity  and extend a set past the point\nwhere y ou’d normally  be spent. Most often, dropsets are done with dumbbells\nor machines, but y our own body  weight can be used for them too.\nHO W IT WO RKS The dropsets we’re using work according to mechanical\nadv antage. When y our arms are spread wide apart, y ou don’t hav e much\nlev erage to pull y ourself up, so wide-grip pullups are among the toughest of\nall pullup v ariations. The workout begins with those. When y ou’v e hit failure,\nit then goes to conv entional chinups, which are easier.\nWhen you can’t do another chinup, you’ll bring your\nhands even closer together, giving you the best\nmechanical advantage possible, and again rep out to\nfailure. The trick is to keep the circuit going, switching to\nexercises that are just easy enough to let you continue\ndoing reps. Unlike with weights, dropsets based on\nmechanical advantage allow you to keep the same load—\nyour body—which ensures your lats get the greatest\npossible stimulus.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each\nin sequence without rest.

Because they’re enormous muscles, working\nthe legs causes greaterrelease of natural anabolic\nhormones than any other body part. This contributes to\nthe growth of all your muscles over time. And if you’re\ninterested in playing sports, running, and preventing a hip\nfracture when you’re an old man, you’ll want to train legs\nnow.\nThe following workouts cover a broad range of\napproaches to leg training, with at least one guaranteed\nto meet your requirements.

Improv ing y our squat will go further toward building big, strong legs\nthan any  other exercise, and the workout at right does it with only  three\nexercises.\nHO W IT WO RKS Most people get stuck coming “out of the hole” on a squat—\nrising up from the bottom position. They  start to pitch forward and their hips\nrise too fast, resulting in bad form that can cause injury  or ev en a missed lift.\nPausing at the bottom will get y ou comfortable with the toughest point in the\nrange of motion.

When y ou can’t get to the\nsquat rack or leg press machine, this workout is the answer, and it requires\nonly  a single pair of dumbbells and a step from the aerobics studio. (If y ou\ntrain at home, a chair or bench will work as well.)\nHO W IT WO RKS The circuit we designed allows y ou to stay  put. Grab one\npair of dumbbells and a little floor space and y ou won’t hav e to mov e until\nthe workout is done. No matter what the traffic flow is around y ou, y ou’ll be\nable to get through y our training without competing for equipment or space.\nThe dumbbell stepup targets the glutes and hamstrings;\nthe reverse lunge works the quads; and the squat, of\ncourse, hits all three. Combine these moves into a circuit\ndone with little rest, and you’ll be in and out of the gym\nwhile everyone else is still waiting for the bench.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one set of each\nin sequence without rest. A fterward, rest 90 seconds, then repeat the circuit\nonce more.\n1 DUMBBELL STEPUP\nSETS: 2 REPS: 5 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nStand behind an aerobics step or other elevated surface\nthat will put your thigh at parallel to the floor when you\nplace your foot onto it. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and\nstep up onto the bench, leaving your trailing leg hanging\noff. Step back down but leave your lead leg on the box\nto begin the next rep. Complete all the reps on that side\nand then switch. That’s one set.\n2 REVERSE LUNGE\nSETS: 2 REPS: 5 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with the dumbbells still in your hands and step back\nwith your right foot. Lower your body until your front\nthigh is parallel to the floor and your rear knee nearly\ntouches the floor. Keep your torso upright. Step forward\nto return to the starting position. Complete all reps on\none leg, then switch legs.

A nd ev en if squats were all y ou could do with it, y ou\nwouldn’t need any  other leg exercises for a long time. But the barbell is more\nv ersatile than most giv e it credit for—we can ev en show y ou how to work\ny our calv es with it—and when combined with some explosiv e body -weight\nexercises, y ou’v e got a workout that’s as good as practically  any  y ou’d get in\na big-box gy m.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout is built on circuits that alternate a heav y\nexercise with an explosiv e one. The heav y  lift recruits a lot of muscle fibers,\nand the explosiv e one done immediately  after allows for ev en better muscle\nactiv ation on the next heav y  set. In just a few sets and a few minutes, y ou\ncan stimulate as many  muscle fibers as y ou normally  would during much\nlonger leg workouts. In addition, the combination of strength and power y ou’ll\nbuild will help improv e sprinting speed and jump height.\nDIREC TIO NS The workout consists of two circuits. C omplete C ircuit 1 as\ndirected and then repeat once more. Then mov e on to C ircuit 2 (which y ou’ll\nperform only  once).\n CIRCUIT 1\nImmediately after your second set of the squat, perform\nthe jump squat.\n1 SQUAT\nSETS: 2 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC. (AFTER THE FIRST SET ONLY)\nSet up in a squat rack or cage. Grasp the bar as far apart\nas is comfortable and step under it. Squeeze your\nshoulder blades together and nudge the bar out of the\nrack. Step back and stand with your feet shoulder width\nand your toes turned slightly outward. Take a deep\nbreath and then bend your hips and knees to lower your\nbody as far as you can without losing the arch in your\nlower back. Push your knees outward as you descend.\nExtend your hips to come back up, continuing to push\nyour knees outward.\n2 JUMP SQUAT\nSETS: 1 REPS: AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN 60 SEC. REST: 60 SEC.\nStand with feet shoulder width apart and squat down\nuntil your thighs are about parallel to the floor but no\ndeeper. Jump as high as you can.

They ’re much easier. This routine\nwill challenge y our balance and hav e y our legs burning so badly  (in a good\nway ) that y ou’ll probably  want to skip them next time around, if it weren’t for\nthe results y ou’ll see and feel.\nHO W IT WO RKS The mov es should look familiar to y ou. Leg curls and split\nsquats are commonly  done with machines and dumbbells, but a suspension\ntrainer has y ou do all the stabilizing y ourself, which means greater muscle\nactiv ation, and greater intensity .\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all the sets for one exercise before mov ing on to the\nnext.\n1 SINGLE-LEG GLUTE BRIDGE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nAttach the suspension trainer to a sturdy overhead object\nand lengthen one handle so it’s at about knee height. Lie\non your back on the floor and place the heel of your left\nfoot in the foot cradle. Your left knee should be bent 90\ndegrees and your right leg extended on the floor. Brace\nyour abs and contract your glutes to bridge your hips up\noff the floor. Come up so that your right leg is in the air\nand in line with your left thigh.\n2 LEG CURL\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10–15 REST: 60 SEC.\nStart in the same position described at left but rest both\nfeet in the foot cradles with legs straight. Bridge your hips\nup so your body forms a straight line, and then bend your\nknees, curling your heels toward your butt. The closer\nyou place your hands to your sides, the more support\nyou’ll get.\n3 BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUAT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 12–15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nUse the same setup as you did for the single-leg glute\nbridge, but stand facing away from the suspension trainer\nand rest your right foot in the foot cradle behind you.\nMake sure your left foot is lunge length in front of the\ntrainer. Bend your hips and knee to lower your body until\nyour rear knee nearly touches the floor. Hold on to\nsomething for support if you feel that you can’t balance\nyourself safely.\nTHE BEST BODY-WEIGHT\nLEG WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #62    BY BEN BRUNO\nWithout weights, most trainers would tell y ou to do endless reps of\nbody -weight squats and lunges for legs. Fortunately , MF contributor\nBen Bruno isn’t one of those trainers. Bruno has one of the most creativ e—\nand, perhaps, dev ious—minds in fitness, and he’s designed a workout that\nmay  bring tears to y our ey es while it adds muscle to y our thighs. We can’t\npromise y ou’ll enjoy  this routine, but we can assure y ou that it’s not like any\ny ou’v e done before.\nHO W IT WO RKS The muscles of the legs are stubborn. They  carry  y ou\naround ev ery where, so it takes more than body -weight squats to conv ince\nthem they  need to get stronger. This workout brings the pain with mov es that\nask the legs to work independently  or without the benefit of locking the knees\nout (which lets them rest momentarily  during a set). C orrecting imbalances in\ny our legs and keeping tension on them for prolonged periods will burn like\nhell, but y ou’ll be amazed y ou could get such results without putting a barbell\non y our back, or doing the same old exercises that didn’t work before.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating\nsets. So y ou’ll do a set of A , rest, then a set of B, rest again, and continue for\nall the prescribed sets.\n1A JUMP SQUAT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned out.\nBend your hips back and lower your body until your thighs\nare parallel to the floor.

(EACH SIDE) REST: 30 SEC.\nKneel down in a lunge position with your right leg in\nfront, and rest your back knee on a towel or mat, if\navailable. Extend your left hand above your head and let\nyour right hand hang at your side. Contract your left glute\nand push your hips forward until you feel a stretch in the\nfront of your hip. Hold for 30 seconds.\n2A SKATER SQUAT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 6 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on your right leg and pick your left one up off the\nfloor. Raise both arms in front of you to act as a\ncounterbalance. If you have light weights or something\nsimilar to help you keep your balance, use it. Bend your\nhips and knee and lower your body as low as you can.\nCome back up.\n2B GLUTE-BRIDGE WALKOUT\nSETS: 4 REPS: 8 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor and bend your knees so\nyour feet rest on the floor close to your butt. Brace your\nabs and drive your heels into the floor to raise your hips\ninto the air. From there, walk your feet out in a V shape,\ntaking small steps with your heels forward and away from\nthe midline of your body. Keep your hips up. Continue\nuntil your legs are extended and then walk them back in.\nThat’s one rep.\n3A 1.5 WALKING LUNGE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 15 (EACH SIDE) REST: 60 SEC.\nTake a big step forward with your left leg and lower your\nrear knee to just above the floor.

Eventually, every guy has\nto work his calves, even if it’s only during the few months\nleading up to summer. We don’t blame you for skipping\nthem—even great trainers fail to program calf work into\nworkouts because they don’t contribute to overall size,\nstrength, and athleticism like the other muscles do. But\nthat doesn’t mean they can’t bring your whole physique\ndown if they’re stringy.\nThese routines bring the calves up fast. So if you have\nthe patience to work them only in the late spring, that’s\nall you’ll need.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM CALF\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #63    BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\nDon’t ov erlook y our calv es—they ’re key  to a complete phy sique.\nPlus, while today ’s shorts and bathing suits do a good job hiding y our\nthighs, y our calv es will alway s be on display  during warmer months (that is,\nunless y ou refuse to wear shorts because of y our calv es).\nThis routine is grounded in progressive overload, the\nfirst rule of weight training, which means gradually\nincreasing the reps, sets, or weights you use and thereby\nforcing your muscles to continually adapt by growing\nbigger and stronger. Tack it onto the end of any leg\nsession.\nHO W IT WO RKS Instead of following strict set and rep parameters, we’ll use\nthe total-rep method. We giv e y ou a certain number of total reps to perform,\nno matter how many  sets it takes, and then let y ou build on that total each\ntime y ou repeat the workout.\nDIREC TIO NS For each mov e, choose a load that allows y ou at least 10\nreps. Then perform as many  sets as it takes to reach 30 total reps, resting the\nprescribed time between sets. The next time y ou do the workout, aim for 35\ntotal reps, then 40, and so on until y ou reach 50. When y ou can perform 50\ntotal reps in fiv e sets or fewer, increase the weight by  20–30 pounds and start\nthe cy cle again at 30 reps.\n1 STANDING CALF RAISE\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 30–50 REST: 60 SEC.\nUse a standing calf raise machine, or stand on a block or\nstep with a dumbbell in one hand while holding on to\nsomething for support with the other. Lower your heels\ntoward the floor until you feel a stretch in your calves.\nDrive the balls of your feet into the foot plate and\ncontract your calves, raising your heels as high as possible.\nControl the descent on each rep.\n2 SEATED CALF RAISE\nSETS: AS MANY AS NEEDED REPS: 30–50 REST: 60 SEC.\nUse a seated calf raise machine, or sit on a bench and rest\nthe balls of your feet on a block or step (and hold\ndumbbells on your thighs for resistance).

Think about it: A ll\nday  long y ou’re putting stress on y our calv es, so they ’re designed for\ndurability . If y ou want to make them grow y ou’ll need to employ  ev ery  trick\nin the book. This workout uses three of our fav orites—jumps, alternating foot\nplacement, and mobility  work.\nHO W IT WO RKS You’v e probably  nev er considered jumping jacks a calf\nexercise but they  demand a lot from the muscles. Follow them up\nimmediately  with calf raises and y ou’ll feel the burn fast. You’ll also notice\nthat y our footing will change ev ery  time y ou repeat a calf raise. This is to\nwork the muscles from all angles. Turn y our toes in and y ou emphasize the\nfibers on the outer side of the calv es; turn them outward and y ou hit the inner\npart harder.\nFinally, you’ll work on calf mobility, which you probably\nnever have before. This is flexibility training that’s specific\nto how your calves work in life. The more mobile your\ncalves are, the more easily you’ll be able to perform calf\nexercises and other lifts (such as the squat and deadlift),\nand the more muscle you’ll be able to recruit.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the paired exercises (marked “A ” and “B”) as\nsupersets. So y ou’ll do one set of A  and then B before resting. C omplete all\nthe prescribed sets for the pair before mov ing on.\n1A JUMPING JACK\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with feet close together and arms at your sides.\nJump and spread your legs outside shoulder width as you\nclap your hands overhead.

Your knees\nshould be bent 90 degrees and your toes turned out\nabout 15 degrees. Allow your heels to drift toward the\nfloor until you feel a stretch in your calves. Now drive the\nballs of your feet into the platform and raise your heels as\nhigh as possible.\n2A SEAL JUMP\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform jumping jacks, but extend your arms out to your\nsides as you jump your feet out.

MURPHY, M.F.S.\nIf y ou’re serious about building muscle, y ou ev entually  hav e to ask\ny ourself how dumb y ou’re willing to look in order to do it. Not all\nexercises appear cool and manly  like the squat and bench press—some of\nthem, like the ones we’re prescribing here for y our calv es—are admittedly  a\nlittle strange. But they  work.\nSo, how dumb are you willing to look to build muscle?\nHO W IT WO RKS The calv es need stimulation any  way  they  can get it, and\ny our body  weight alone can be plenty , as long as y ou make it feel as heav y\nas possible. O ne way  is to lower y our body  into the bottom of a squat\nposition, putting all y our weight squarely  on y our calv es and performing calf\nraises from there. A nother is to walk around like a ballerina on y our toes. We\nexpect y ou won’t be doing this workout in a gy m, but in the priv acy  of y our\nown home, so that should sav e y ou some embarrassment. But when y ou see\nwhat this routine does for y our calv es after a few weeks, y ou won’t feel so\nshy  (or look so stupid).\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all sets for one exercise before going on to the next.\n1 SINGLE-LEG CALF RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 20 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand on a block or step with one leg, your weight\nresting on the ball of your foot. Wrap your free foot\naround the back of the working leg. Allow your body to\nsink toward the floor and stretch your calf.

Do not let your heels\ntouch the floor at any time. If you can, do these barefoot\nfor greater muscle activation.\n4 JUMPING CALF RAISE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 5 REST: 60 SEC.\nStand tall with feet flat on the floor and jump using only\nyour calves. Land softly, absorbing the force by dropping\ninto a half squat; also try to land quietly.\n \n21   BUTT\nWe’re pretty sure this is the only men’s workout book\nthat has a dedicated butt-training section, and we’re\nproud of it. That’s not to say that we expect you to train\nglutes with the same gusto as you do chest, but by giving\nmore specific attention to your rear, you can build more\nmuscle and strength while enhancing your sex appeal\nfaster than with any other body part.\nThink we’ve lost our minds? Give some of these\nworkouts a go and see if all your lifts don’t improve as a\nresult. Don’t be surprised if the scale also goes up (that is,\nif you’re trying to gain muscle weight), your lower back\nand knees feel better, and you start getting more\ncompliments on your ass than ever before.\nTHE BEST FULL-GYM\nBUTT WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #66    BY BRET CONTRERAS\nThe glutes do more than just round out the back of y our pants. Most\nguy s hav e no idea that they ’re the strongest muscles in the body  and\nthe main engine behind lifting huge amounts of weight on the squat and\ndeadlift. Your butt helps y ou run faster and jump higher, too, so when this\nworkout brings up y our backside, remember that it’s not just for the ladies.\nHO W IT WO RKS The three glute exercises we’v e chosen may  be the best\nknown to man. The barbell hip thrust alone has been shown to activ ate the\nglute muscles more fully  than any  other lift—one look at it (as well as its\nname) and y ou can guess its applications.\nDIREC TIO NS C omplete all the prescribed sets for one exercise before\nmov ing on to the next.\n1 BARBELL HIP THRUST\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nRest your upper back on a bench and sit on the floor with\nlegs extended. Roll a loaded barbell up your thighs until\nthe bar sits on your lap (you may want to place a towel\nor mat on your hips or attach a pad to the bar for\ncomfort).

You won’t be able to\nget a full contraction on squats and other exercises that work the\nglutes, and that robs y ou of gains. But when y ou integrate hip-opener\nexercises into y our glute training, y ou can get the posterior y ou want while\nimprov ing strength and athleticism, and warding off lower-back pain.\nHO W IT WO RKS The first and third exercise pairs alternate strength\nmov ements with mobility  drills that open y our hips. Don’t skip these! They\ndon’t exactly  build muscle but rather help y ou to build muscle indirectly  by\nimprov ing y our ability  to extend y our hips. That simple motion—using the\nmuscles in y our butt to push y our hips forward—is the most powerful single\nmov ement the body  can perform (and the foundation for sprinting and\nsquatting). A lso, mobile hips take pressure off the lumbar spine, reliev ing any\naches y ou may  be dealing with back there.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercise pairs (marked “A ” and “B”) as alternating\nsets.

Bend your hips back and let your\nknees bend as needed until you can grasp the bar at\nshoulder width. Your torso should be almost parallel to\nthe floor with your chest up. Keeping your lower back in\nits natural arch, push your hips forward to raise the bar to\nlockout. To begin each subsequent rep, push your hips\nback and lower the bar to mid-shin level. Do not bend\nyour knees more and make it a deadlift—the movement\nmust come almost entirely from your hips.\n2B BARBELL GLUTE BRIDGE\nSETS: 3 REPS: 10 REST: 60 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor with legs extended. Roll the\nbar up your thighs until the bar sits on your lap (you may\nwant to place a towel on your hips or attach a pad to the\nbar for comfort). Brace your abs and drive your heels into\nthe floor to extend your hips, raising them until they’re in\nline with your torso. Use the same weight you did for the\nSumo RDL.

The glute bridge isn’t as “sexy ” as a squat, but the more\nproficient y ou get at it, the stronger y our squat can be; and stronger squatting\nleads to a rounder, harder butt that women notice.\nHO W IT WO RKS Performing a single-leg glute bridge before a single-leg\nsquat gets the glutes activ ated—y our mind can make a stronger connection to\nthem during training and y our body  is more prepared to fully  recruit them\nwhen y ou go on to squat.

The back of\nthe leg comes up and then prominently  curv es outward to form the buttock.\nStrangely  enough, y ou can actually  target this specific area, and women will\nappreciate it if y ou do.\nHO W IT WO RKS We’v e added a little hamstring workout into the glute\ntraining to strengthen both muscle groups, because they  work in conjunction\nto extend y our hips, but this will also sharpen the distinction between the two\nwhere they  meet on the back of the leg. Specifically , y ou’ll fatigue y our hams\nwith hip thrusts on the ball and then finish them off with hamstring curls—y our\nglutes will be firing as well to stabilize y ou.\nThe butterfly hip thrust provides another challenge. This\none targets the gluteus medius, which is commonly\nunderdeveloped and can lead to instability and weakness\nin the entire lower body.

The suitcase\ndeadlift makes y our core brace to prev ent y ou from bending sideway s. These\nmov es also double as great metabolism boosters.

Instead,\nwe split up our body into parts that we train on different\ndays; hence the term “split routine.” Yet there exists\nanother way—to train the entire upper body one day and\nthe lower half another—and there are several advantages\nto it.\nWorking the whole upper body one day allows you to\ncome back a few days later and work it again. Say you\nnormally train your chest once every five days. You could\nhit it twice in three days, doubling the muscle-building\nstimulus simply by switching from body-part workouts to\nan upper-body split.\nUpper-body splits are also ideal for strength building,\nallowing you to focus workouts around a main lift and then\nworking all the muscles that play a part in making that lift\nstronger.\nThe upper-body workouts we’ve included here pair up\nwell with the lower-body routines that follow them,\nsomething to consider if you’re looking for a complete\nprogram.\nTHE BEST UPPER-BODY\nWORKOUT [option A]\nWORKOUT #80    BY C.J.

This 30-minute\nworkout will be ov er in no time.\nDIREC TIO NS Spend one minute on each piece of equipment and repeat for\nrounds. Gauge y our intensity  with the rating of perceiv ed exertion (RPE)—a\nsimple 1 to 10 scale where “1” is relaxed and “10” is all-out effort. Rest only\nas long as it takes to transition between stations. Specific RPEs hav e been set\nfor y ou for each round, but the machines are interchangeable. So if y ou can’t\ndo the exercises in the order shown, don’t worry  about it. Just hit the right\nRPE on each machine in turn.\nWARMUP\nJog on the treadmill at an RPE of 3 for two minutes.\nROUND 1\nOne minute each at an RPE of 5; rest three minutes.\nROUND 2\nOne minute each at an RPE of 8; rest three minutes.\nROUND 3\nOne minute each at an RPE of 8 for the elliptical and\nrower, and 10 for the bike and treadmill.\nCOOLDOWN\nUse any one of the machines at an RPE of 3–5 for 10\nminutes.\nTHE BEST TREADMILL\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #85    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nSome people walk and others run. Some jog while others do\ninterv als. Both long-duration and short-burst sty les of cardio strengthen\nthe heart and burn fat, so no matter which category  y ou prefer, y ou need to\nembrace both for maximum conditioning and fat loss. This workout blends\nthem seamlessly .\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout breaks down into blocks of brisk walking,\njogging, and light walking for activ e recov ery . You’ll begin y our runs\nsomewhat fatigued from the steep incline walking y ou do beforehand, and\nthis will take y our heart rate near its max. Before y ou burn out, y ou back off\nto a lighter pace to catch y our breath, and then the cy cle begins again.\nBLOCK 1\n Set the treadmill on a 9-degree incline and walk 60\nseconds.\n Decrease the incline to 3 degrees and run at the\nfastest speed you can maintain for 120 seconds.\n Slow down to a walk for 60 seconds.\nBLOCK 2\n Increase the incline to 8 degrees and walk for 60\nseconds.\n Decrease the incline to 4 degrees and run as fast as\nyou can for 120 seconds.\n Reduce the incline to 3 degrees and walk 60 seconds.\nBLOCK 3\n Raise the incline to 7 degrees and walk 60 seconds.\n Lower the incline to 5 degrees and run as fast as you\ncan for 120 seconds.\n Reduce the incline to 3 degrees and walk 60 seconds.\nBLOCK 4\n Increase the incline to 4 degrees and run four minutes.\n Walk on the 4-degree incline for five minutes.\nTHE BEST ELLIPTICAL\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #86    BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T.\nThe elliptical machine offers one of the most low-impact cardio\nworkouts possible. This routine lasts only  25 minutes, and the only\npounding y ou’ll feel will be in y our chest.\nHO W IT WO RKS You’ll be doing interv als, gradually  increasing the duration\nof y our work interv al while decreasing the length of the rest interv als. This\nintensifies the fat-burning effect while giv ing a constant stimulus to the heart\nand lungs.\nDIREC TIO NS A lternate work interv als and rest interv als on the elliptical.\nThe pace y ou work at will be based on a percentage of y our maximum heart\nrate (MHR). To estimate y our MHR, subtract y our age from 220. (So, a 30-\ny ear-old would hav e an approximate MHR of 190 beats per minute.) Your\nwork interv al (WI) will be 85% of that number, and y our rest interv al (RI)\nwill be 55%.\nFor example, a 30-year-old man will keep his heart rate\nat 160 beats per minute during the work interval and then\nreduce his effort to around 100 beats per minute for the\nrest interval. Note that the rest interval does not mean\ncomplete rest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a\nheart rate monitor, you can estimate your heart rate by\nputting your index and middle fingers to your carotid\nartery (to the left of your throat) and counting the beats\nin your pulse for six seconds. Take that number and\nmultiply it by 10 to get your beats per minute.\nTHE BEST ROWING-\nMACHINE WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #87    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nUnlike running or cy cling, which work only  y our lower half, rowing\nmachines (or ergometers) inv olv e almost the entire upper body  as\nwell. This means y ou’ll burn more calories—around 500 in about 30 minutes.\nHO W IT WO RKS The sy stem we use here is called the ladder method. You\nstart light to warm up, gradually  increasing the intensity  until y ou’re going all\nout (500 meters). Then y ou back off just as slowly —down the ladder—until\ny ou cool down with the same intensity  y ou warmed up at. The effect trains\ny ou to pace y ourself and maintain a high output ev en when y ou’re fatigued.\nDIREC TIO NS Sit on the rower’s seat and adjust the foot height for the size\nof y our feet. Strap y our feet onto the rower’s footplates—the strap should be\nat or abov e the ball of y our foot. Set the drag on the machine to between\nthree and fiv e (this best simulates rowing on water), grasp the handle, and sit\nback so y our torso is almost v ertical. You should feel pressure on the balls of\ny our feet and y our heels should be raised slightly  off the footplate. This is the\n“catch” position.\nDrive with your legs, dropping your heels to the\nfootplate, to push your body back and then row the\nhandle to your sternum. Row as fast as possible for all\nintervals, but take twice as long to return your body back\nto the catch position after each row stroke. Maintain this\nrhythm.\nPERFORM THE FOLLOWING INTERVALS:\nRow 100 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 200 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 300 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 400 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 500 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 400 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 300 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 200 meters / rest 30 seconds\nRow 100 meters / rest 30 seconds\nTHE BEST SPIN-BIKE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #88    BY STEVE GISSELMAN\nLike the elliptical machine, stationary  bikes don’t put much strain on\nthe body , so y ou can perform hard interv als on them without fear of\npounding y our joints or pulling any  muscles.\nHO W IT WO RKS Because y our upper body  doesn’t get as inv olv ed as it is\nwith sprinting or rowing, and there is no impact, y ou need to pump y our legs\nthat much harder to make up the intensity  on a bike.

That may  hav e been an\nexaggeration, since these interv als are tough. Working at high-intensity  paces\nfor short durations (30 seconds) and low-intensity  ones for longer (60 seconds)\nwill help giv e y ou the benefits of both anaerobic and aerobic cardio.\nDIREC TIO NS A lternate between high-intensity , low-intensity , and rest\ninterv als as shown. Base y our intensity  off a percentage of y our maximum\nheart rate (MHR).\nTo estimate your MHR, subtract your age from 220.\n(So, a 30-year-old would have an approximate MHR of 190\nbeats per minute.) The high-intensity work sets call for a\nheart rate that’s 85–95% of your maximum; so, a 30-year-\nold will keep his heart rate between 160 and 180 beats\nper minute during that time.\nNote that the rest interval does not mean complete\nrest, but a very easy pace. If you don’t have a heart rate\nmonitor, you can estimate your heart rate by putting your\nindex and middle fingers on your carotid artery (to the left\nof your throat) and counting the beats in your pulse for\nsix seconds.

For the circuits, complete the exercises in\nsuccession and then rest 30 seconds before repeating once more.\nCARDIO 1\nJog for two minutes.\n CIRCUIT 1\nA OVERHEAD LUNGE\nREPS: 10 (EACH SIDE) REST: 0 SEC.\nRaise your arms overhead and step forward with your\nright leg. Lower your body until your right thigh is parallel\nto the floor and your rear knee nearly touches the floor.\nB SKYDIVER LUNGE\nREPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\nGet on the floor in the bottom of a pushup position. Push\nyourself up, then lower back down to rest your belly on\nthe floor. Now raise your arms and legs up off the floor so\nyou look like a skydiver in free fall. Place your hands and\nfeet back down and push yourself back up. That’s one\nrep.\nC GLUTE BRIDGE\nREPS: 12 REST: 30 SEC.\nLie on your back on the floor with knees bent 90 degrees\nand heels on the floor. Extend your arms by your sides.\nSqueeze your glutes and push your heels into the floor to\nraise your hips until your torso and thighs form a line.\nLower your hips until they’re just above the floor.\nCARDIO 2\nShadowbox for two minutes. Throw punches with both\nhands, keep your guard up, and practice shuffling your\nfeet forward, back, and side to side.\n CIRCUIT 2\nA SUMO SQUAT\nREPS: 15 REST: 0 SEC.\nStand with feet outside shoulder width and turn your\ntoes out 45 degrees. Raise your arms up for balance. As\nyou squat down, push your knees out and then drive\nyour heels into the floor as you come up.\nB PIKE PUSHUP\nREPS: 12 REST: 0 SEC.\nGet into pushup position with hands slightly wider than\nshoulder width. Push your body backward so your hips\nrise in the air and your torso points toward the floor.\nKeeping your legs straight, lower your body until the top\nof your head nearly touches the floor, and then press up.\nC FROG THRUST\nREPS: 10 REST: 30 SEC.\nGet into pushup position with feet wide apart. Hop your\nfeet up to the outside of your hands so you look like\nyou’re about to leapfrog. Then hop them back again.\nThat’s one rep.\nCARDIO 3\nGo to a staircase and sprint or jog up it. Walk back down.\nRepeat for two minutes and mix it up—try skipping steps\nor hopping up the stairs.\n CORE\nPLANK/SIDE PLANK COMBO\nGet into pushup position and then lower your forearms to\nthe floor. Hold 15 seconds, and then rotate your body to\nyour right, resting on your left forearm and stacking your\nfeet so your whole body faces 90 degrees to the floor.\nHold 15 seconds. Rotate back to the floor and hold 15\nseconds. Rotate to your left and hold the side plank\nagain. Keep your hips elevated the whole time.\nTHE BEST SWIMMING\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #92    BY GREGORY KINCHELOE\nWhen trainers are asked to name the v ery  “best” ty pe of exercise,\nswimming regularly  gets the top honor. There’s no impact, it works\nev ery  muscle in the body , and it makes y our heart speed like an outboard\nmotor. Whether y ou’re looking to plunge into swimming because y ou want a\nbody  more like Ry an Lochte’s, or y ou’re already  a swimmer in need of a new\nchallenge in the pool, float this routine for a few weeks.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout stresses good swim technique. Just practicing\nthe basic strokes correctly  will get the right muscles working in addition to\nhelping y ou cut through the water faster and more efficiently  (so y ou feel\nmore like a fish in water than out). O v er time, y ou’ll reduce y our rest periods\nto demand more of y our heart and increase y our potential for fat burning.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the workout three times a week. Go by  stroke cy cles\ninstead of distance—a sweep of each arm in turn is one cy cle. If y our pool is\ntoo small to complete the prescribed number of cy cles in one direction, turn\naround quickly  and continue to swim until the cy cles are complete. A fter two\nweeks, reduce all rests by  fiv e seconds.\n1 WARMUP\nSETS: 4\nSwim 12 stroke cycles at an easy pace. You can use the\nfront crawl stroke or swim freestyle. Rest a moment, then\ncontinue for three more sets.\n2 50-YARD SWIM\nSETS: 6 REST: 30 SEC.\nSwim at a brisk pace for 50 yards, or 25 total stroke\ncycles.\n3 FINGERTIP DRAG STROKE\nSETS: 4 REST: 20 SEC.\nSwim 12 stroke cycles, raising your elbows high out of the\nwater as you reach for the next stroke so only your\nfingertips drag beneath the surface. Swim at a relaxed\npace.\n4 KICK DRILL\nSETS: 4 REST: 30 SEC.\nGrab a kickboard and rest your arms on it. Swim across\nthe pool using only your legs. Do 25 kick cycles—one\nflutter of the left and right leg.\n5 PULL DRILL\nSETS: 6 REST: 20 SEC.\nHold the kickboard between your legs to keep them\nafloat, and swim using only your arms for 12 stroke cycles.\nReach each arm far forward, but don’t let your fingers\ncome out of the water.\n \n28   RUNNING\nRunning—either for food or for your life—is the oldest form\nof cardio, so we’d be remiss not to give it its own section.\nWhether you like to take it slow and steady or hit a top\nspeed, either of these routines will lead you closer to a\nlean body with a healthier heart.\nTHE BEST ENDURANCE-\nRUNNING WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #93    BY STEVE GISSELMAN\nA s y ou may  hav e gathered from all the interv al and circuit workouts\nin this book, long, slow endurance training is not the best way  to lose\nfat. So if y ou’re thinking of starting a running program to get lean, we promise\ny ou’ll do better with one of our strength-training options. Nev ertheless, some\npeople just enjoy  running (may be it’s the endorphin rush known as “runner’s\nhigh”?) and ev en aspire to compete in endurance races. If that’s why  y ou\nwant to hit the trail, this program is especially  for y ou.\nHO W IT WO RKS We’v e set up a sev en-week routine to take y ou from a\nnewbie runner (or someone who doesn’t put in consistent road work) to an\nexperienced one who’s ready  to take on a half marathon (13.1 miles). Most of\nthe workouts are relativ ely  short, so y ou can build y our capacity  gradually\nand av oid the knee pain and other ov eruse injuries associated with running\ntoo much, too soon.

Jason Ferruggia, designer of this workout\nand a longtime training adv iser to Men’s Fitness, is a huge fan of legendary\nNFL running back Walter Pay ton. He likes to point out that Pay ton, who was\nperpetually  ripped and known for his durability , made hill sprints a cornerstone\nof his workouts throughout his career.\nDo the same, and your pick-up game buddies may be\ncalling you “Sweetness,” or, at least, not “Slowness.”\nHO W IT WO RKS Sprinting is intense exercise and can beat up y our lower\nbody  if y ou don’t ease into it. That’s why  we recommend doing it on a hill\nlike Pay ton did, which will slow y ou down a bit so that y ou’re less likely  to\npull a hamstring, quad, or hip flexor. Still, y ou’ll work hard enough to raise\ntestosterone and growth hormone lev els—both associated with muscle growth\n—as well as improv e speed and athleticism.\nWARMUP\nWarm up thoroughly beforehand and run a few practice\nsprints at a low intensity (but go a little faster each time).\nSPRINT\nPerform 8 to 10 sprints of 20–40 yards. Run at slightly less\nthan your absolute top speed for safety. Rest as needed\nbetween sets, but keep your heart rate elevated. Allow\nyourself enough recovery that you can go fast.\nIf you’re new to sprinting or haven’t done it in a while, do\nyour sprints on a hill. Start with five and run only at a\nmoderate pace and build up from there.\nLand on the balls of your feet as you sprint, not your\nheels. Your front foot should land directly beneath you\n(unless the hill is especially steep). Your arms should pump\nvigorously forward and backward as you run. Let your\nhands come up to face level and then back to your\npockets, but no further. Keep your shoulders and hips\nlevel so there’s no side-to-side rotation in your torso.\n \n29   BOXING & MMA\nEvery guy wants to look like a fighter, before a fight, that\nis. The ripped, athletic look of a fighter says “strong,”\n“capable,” “explosive,” but not “vain” or “musclebound.”\nWe talked to fighters and fight trainers to bring you the\nfollowing boxing and MMA workouts, all designed to hit\nyour gut hard.\nTHE BEST PUNCHING-\nBAG WORKOUT\nWORKOUT #95    BY ZACH EVEN-ESH\nBoxers, kickboxers, and mixed martial arts fighters don’t use treadmills\nto get ripped. Their shredded phy siques come from fight training, of\nwhich pounding a heav y  bag is a major component. Dust off the one in y our\nbasement, lace up the glov es, and beat y our gut once and for all.\nHO W IT WO RKS Hitting a bag builds punching power, stamina, and can\nincrease y our metabolic rate for day s afterward. This workout inv olv es y our\nlegs as well as y our arms to train the whole body , activ ating as much muscle\nas possible to burn the most calories.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform the exercises as a circuit, completing one after the\nother without rest. A fterward, rest 30 seconds. That’s one round. Repeat for\nfiv e total rounds. To av oid injury , wear hand wraps and bag glov es.\n1 LOW KICK – RIGHT LEG\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nKick the lower half of the bag, as if aiming for an\nopponent’s leg. Pivot on your support foot and turn your\nhip over as you deliver the kick, to maximize power.\nComplete five low kicks.\n2 HIGH KICK – RIGHT LEG\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nKick the upper half of the bag, as if aiming for an\nopponent’s head. Keep your hands raised as if guarding\nyour chin. Throw five kicks.\n3 LOW KICK – LEFT LEG\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nRepeat the low kicks on the left leg.\n4 HIGH KICK – LEFT LEG\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nRepeat the high kicks on the left leg.\n5 PUNCHES\nREPS: 20 REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform 20 straight punches on the bag, alternating\nhands. Keep your guard up and turn your hips into each\npunch.\n6 LEFT HOOK\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform five left hooks—swing your arm in an arc to hit\nthe side of the bag.\n7 RIGHT HOOK\nREPS: 5 REST: 0 SEC.\nPerform five on the right side.\n8 KNEE STRIKE\nREPS: 5 REST: 30 SEC.\nDrive one knee up into the bag. Repeat on the other leg.\nTHE BEST JUMP-ROPE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #96    BY MARTIN ROONEY, C.S.C.S.\nSome time after grade school, guy s stop jumping rope—unless they\ngrow up to be boxers. But the jump rope may  be the most portable\nand conv enient cardio tool av ailable. Relearn how to use it and y ou’ll be lean,\nspry , and well conditioned for life.\nHO W IT WO RKS Make sure y ou’v e got a good rope. Beaded or plastic\n“speed” ropes are more durable than cotton ones and whip around faster,\nmaking for a more intense workout. They ’re also mandatory  if y ou want to\nbuild up to doing adv anced jump-rope mov es like the double jump (which\nwe’v e included here, although we don’t expect y ou to master it right away ).\nBefore y ou begin using a rope, measure it to y our height. When y ou stand on\nthe middle of the rope, the handles should extend to y our armpits. C ut and\nadjust the length as necessary .\nYou have to gradually prepare your lower body for the\nimpact of jumping, so begin on a waxed wooden floor or\nrubber floor.\nHold the rope with hands at about hip height and\nelbows slightly bent, keeping your upper arms close to\nyour sides. Your chest should be out and your shoulders\nback and down. Make your jumps small and land on the\nballs of your feet.\nDIREC TIO NS The workout consists of three training blocks. You’ll practice\ndifferent jumps, rest two minutes, and mov e on to the next block. Follow the\ninstructions.\nBLOCK 1\n1 FORWARD JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nJump over the rope with both feet on every revolution,\nswinging the rope forward (the most basic jump).\n2 SIDE-TO-SIDE JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nJump a few inches to your left as you swing the rope.\nThen to your right. Get into a rhythm.\n3 BACKWARD JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nSwing the rope backward for each jump.\n4 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – LEFT\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nJump on one foot; land softly.\n5 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – RIGHT\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nJump on the other foot.\nREST 120 SEC.\nBLOCK 2\n1 FORWARD JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\n2 ALTERNATING JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nJump on one foot and then the other, back and forth.\n3 FOOT-CROSS JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nCross your feet over each other on each rep. Alternate\nthe foot that lands in front.\n4 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – LEFT\nREPS: 60 SEC.\n5 SINGLE-LEG JUMP – RIGHT\nREPS: 60 SEC.\nREST 120 SEC.\nBLOCK 3\n1 FORWARD JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\n2 DOUBLE JUMP\nREPS: 30 SEC.\nJump high enough that you can pass the rope under your\nfeet twice on every revolution. If you can’t do it fluidly,\npractice it for 30 seconds—it doesn’t matter how many\ntimes you miss.\n3 BACKWARD JUMP\nREPS: 60 SEC.\n4 DOUBLE JUMP\nREPS: 30 SEC.\nTHE BEST MMA CARDIO\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #97    BY MICHAEL SCHLETTER, C.P.T.\nIt’s probably  best that y ou leav e mixed martial arts fighting to the\nprofessionals in the UFC  and watch it from the safety  of y our couch\n(behind the bag of Fritos). But there’s no reason y ou can’t train like a fighter\nto lose fat and build y our wind. The following is a pretty  good simulation of\nan MMA  fight-y ou know, without the foot about to land upside y our head.\nHO W IT WO RKS The workout lasts approximately  as long as a real\nchampionship MMA  fight: fiv e rounds. In those rounds y ou’ll perform a little of\nnearly  ev ery  kind of exercise that fighters use to prepare for battle, from\njumping rope to body -weight circuits to combinations on the heav y  bag. Use\nit to get in fighting shape, and then watch the real fights from the safety  of\ny our couch.\nDIREC TIO NS Follow the instructions for the fiv e rounds.\n ROUND 1\nWARMUP, 3 MINUTES TOTAL WORK\nJump rope for three minutes; rest 90 seconds.\n ROUND 2\n4 MINUTES TOTAL WORK\nShadowbox for two minutes. Then perform the circuit of\nexercises for two more minutes:\nSHADOWBOX\nStay light on your feet and throw jabs, crosses, hooks,\nand uppercuts at an imaginary opponent. Keep your\nhands up.\nPUSHUP\nPerform conventional pushups, aiming for 20 reps.\nBODY-WEIGHT SQUAT\nStand with feet shoulder width and toes turned slightly\nout. Bend your hips back and squat as low as you can.\nAim for 20 reps.\nPLANK\nGet into pushup position and then bend your elbows so\nyour forearms lie flat on the floor. Brace your abs and hold\nthe position until the end of two minutes.\nREST 90 SEC.\n ROUND 3\n5 MINUTES TOTAL WORK\nPerform the following combinations on the heavy bag and\nthen jump rope for the remainder of five minutes.\n50 JABS\n50 CROSSES\n50 JABS AND CROSSES\n25 JABS, CROSSES, AND HOOKS\nJUMP ROPE\nREST 120 SEC.\n ROUND 4\n5 MINUTES TOTAL WORK\nPerform the following combinations on a heavy bag and\nthen jump rope for the remainder of five minutes.\nALTERNATING KNEE STRIKES, 60 SECONDS\nALTERNATING KICKS, 60 SECONDS\n50 JABS AND KICKS\n50 CROSSES AND\nKICKS JUMP ROPE\nREST 120 SEC.\n ROUND 5\n5 MINUTES TOTAL WORK\nPerform the following grappling drills on the floor for five\nminutes.\n10 FORWARD ROLLS\n10 BACKWARD ROLLS\n100 SITUPS\nGROUND N’ POUND\n(place a heavy bag or shield on the floor; mount, and strike it)\n15 PUSHUPS\nJUMP ROPE\n \n30   ABS IN UNDER 30\nMINUTES\nIt doesn’t take long to build muscles and burn fat. If the\nstimulus is intense, the time it takes to apply it can and\nshould be very short. Depending on how dire your time\nconstraints are, you can choose one of these workouts to\nlet you sneak in some training. We offer routines for 30,\n20, 10, and even just four minutes.\nTHE BEST 30-MINUTE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #98    BY JIM SMITH, C.S.C.S.\nThe best way  to get more out of y our workouts is to set a time limit\nfor y ourself. Racing the clock forces y ou to work harder, faster, and\nmore efficiently . Ev ery  second counts. This is what Escalating Density\nTraining (EDT)—as made famous by  strength coach C harles Staley —is all\nabout: Pick a duration and get the best workout possible before the clock runs\nout. You’re about to find out how to use EDT to sculpt a great body  when\ny ou hav e time for nothing less.\nHO W IT WO RKS Here’s how EDT works. First, set a time limit—in this case,\n30 minutes. Pick two different body  parts y ou want to train that don’t\ncompete with each other; for example, chest and back or hamstrings and\nthighs. A  pair like chest and shoulders would not work because it inv olv es the\nsame muscles and will fatigue y ou too fast.\nChoose an exercise for each body part and a weight\nthat allows you 10–12 reps for each. Begin alternating\nsets of the two moves, resting as little as possible\nbetween sets. Go a few reps short of failure on every set.\nContinue until 30 minutes is up. Make note of the rest\nperiods you took between sets and the total number of\nreps you performed. The next time you repeat the\nworkout, try to improve your performance without\nextending the time frame. At right are examples of EDT\nsupersets you can use.\n SUPERSET OPTIONS\nSHOULDERS AND BACK\nDumbbell Overhead Press\nLat Pulldown\nHAMSTRINGS AND THIGHS\nBarbell Romanian Deadlift\nLeg Extension\nBICEPS AND TRICEPS\nBarbell Curl\nClose-Grip Pushup\nCHEST AND BACK\nDumbbell Bench Press\nSeated Cable Row\nTHIGHS AND CHEST\nFront Squat\nPushup\nTHIGHS AND BACK\nLeg Press\nPullup\nTHE BEST 20-MINUTE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #99    BY MICHAEL CAMP, D.P.T., C.S.C.S.\nWell-rounded fitness means being both strong and conditioned, but a\ntight schedule usually  causes either weights or cardio to get left out of\ny our program. The answer is to combine them both in one densely  packed\ncircuit.\nHO W IT WO RKS A lthough y ou’ll train for only  a fraction of the time that\nmost guy s sweat it out in gy ms, y ou won’t sacrifice big gains in this workout.\nThe brisk pace will double as cardio, and the sequencing has another\nadv antage as well—mov ing from smaller to larger muscle groups enhances\nthe way  y our muscles are recruited, resulting in greater strength and muscle\ngains.\nDIREC TIO NS The workout is broken into six circuits. It may  look long, but\nthe whole routine will take only  20 minutes. Perform the circuits in order,\nrepeating where noted. Your rest between exercises should be only  as long as\nit takes to transition between mov es. Repeat this workout up to four times a\nweek on nonconsecutiv e day s.\n CIRCUIT A\n1 TREADMILL RUN/WALK\nWalk one minute and then sprint one minute.\n2 DUMBBELL FLYE\nREPS: 8–10\nLie on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand.

This will ensure that y our\nbody  is getting more efficient and better conditioned.\nDIREC TIO NS Set a timer for howev er long y ou hav e—ev en if y ou’v e got\nonly  10 minutes. C omplete as many  reps as y ou can of each exercise, and\ncount them. Stop a set when y our form breaks down, and rest as needed.\nMake note of y our total number of reps for the workout. Each time y ou\nrepeat the workout with the same time period, try  to complete more total\nreps.\nFor example, if you worked out 10 minutes on Monday\nand then 25 minutes on Wednesday but could manage\nonly 10 minutes again on Friday, try to get more work\ndone in Friday’s session than in Monday’s. Try to perform\nthe workout four to six times per week.\n1 PRISONER SQUAT\nPlace your hands behind your head, interlacing your\nfingers. Stand with your feet shoulder width and your\ntoes turned slightly out. Squat as low as you can.\n2 SEAL JUMP\nPerform a jumping jack, reaching your arms out 90\ndegrees to your sides as your legs spread. When you\njump your legs back in, clap your hands together in front\nof you.\n3 PUSHUP\nPlace your hands on the floor at shoulder width. Keeping\nyour abs braced and your body in a straight line, squeeze\nyour shoulder blades together and lower your body until\nyour chest is an inch above the floor.\n4 LATERAL JUMP\nJump to your right side and land on your right foot.\nRebound off your right foot and jump back to your left to\nbegin the next rep.\n5 BURPEE\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend down and place\nyour hands on the floor. Now shoot your legs behind you\nquickly so you end up in the top of a pushup position.\nJump your legs back up so they land between your hands\nand then jump up in the air.\nTHE BEST 4-MINUTE\nWORKOUT\nWORKOUT #101    BY SEAN HYSON, C.S.C.S.\nNormally , we’d say  that a workout that lasts four minutes must be\nwussy , but if it’s a Tabata, that’s another story . Izumi Tabata, Ph.D.,\na researcher at the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Toky o, Japan,\nfound that brutally  intense interv al workouts lasting just four minutes\nimprov ed endurance better than more conv entional interv al training—and\nincreased fat burning. We know y ou’v e got the time for this workout, and to\ngiv e y ou one less excuse to skip it, we’ll giv e y ou only  one exercise to do.\nHO W IT WO RKS Tabata workouts are designed according to a work-to-rest\nratio of 2:1. You go as hard as y ou can for, say , 20 seconds, rest 10, and then\nrepeat. You can choose one or sev eral exercises to use for Tabatas. We’v e\nprescribed just the burpee. A  total-body  exercise equally  fav ored and dreaded\nby  martial artists and soldiers, the burpee tires y ou out faster than probably\nany  other body -weight mov ement. It will make the ensuing four minutes the\nslowest of y our life.\nDIREC TIO NS Perform burpees for 20 seconds. Don’t worry  about counting\nreps—just set a timer and do as many  as y ou can. Then rest 10 seconds, and\nrepeat for four minutes. O v er time, y ou can add time to the work interv al,\nbut keep the ratio of work to rest at 2:1 (so if y ou build up to doing burpees\nfor 30 seconds, rest 15 seconds between sets).\nBURPEE\nStand with feet shoulder width and bend down and place\nyour hands on the floor. Now shoot your legs behind you\nquickly so you’re in the top of a pushup position. Jump\nyour legs back up so they land between your hands and\nthen jump up quickly.\n"

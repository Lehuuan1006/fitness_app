In \nfact, the most essential yogic concepts can be derived from observing the cell’s form \nand function. This chapter explores breath anatomy from a yogic perspective, using the \ncell as a starting point.\nYoga Lessons From a Cell\nCells are the smallest building blocks of life, from single-celled plants to multitrillion-celled \nanimals. The human body, which is made up of roughly 100 trillion cells, begins as a single, \nnewly fertilized cell.\nA cell consists of three parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. The \nmembrane separates the cell’s external environment, which contains nutrients that the cell \nrequires, from its internal environment, which consists of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. \nNutrients have to get through the membrane, and once inside, the cell metabolizes these \nnutrients and turns them into the energy that fuels its life functions. As a result of this \nmetabolic activity, waste gets generated that must somehow get back out through the \nmembrane. Any impairment in the membrane’s ability to let nutrients in or waste out will \nresult in the death of the cell via starvation or toxicity. This observation that living things \ntake in nutrients provides a good basis for understanding the term prana, which refers to \nwhat nourishes a living thing. Prana refers not only to what is brought in as nourishment \nbut also to the action that brings it in.1\nOf course, there has to be a complementary force. The yogic concept that complements \nprana is apana, which refers to what is eliminated by a living thing as well as the action of \nelimination.2 These two fundamental yogic terms—prana and apana—describe the essential \nactivities of life.\nSuccessful function, of course, \nexpresses itself in a particular form. \nCertain conditions have to exist \nin a cell for nutrition (prana) to \nenter and waste (apana) to exit. \nThe membrane’s structure has to \nallow things to pass in and out of \nit—it has to be permeable (see \nfigure 1.1). It can’t be so perme-\nable, however, that the cell wall \nloses its integrity; otherwise, the \ncell will either explode from the \npressures within or implode from \nthe pressures outside.\n1 The Sanskrit word prana is derived from pra, a prepositional prefix meaning “before,” and an, a verb meaning “to breathe,” \n“to blow,” and “to live.” Here, prana is not being capitalized, because it refers to the functional life processes of a single entity. \nThe capitalized Prana is a more universal term that is used to designate the manifestation of all creative life force.\n2 The Sanskrit word apana is derived from apa, which means “away,” “off,” and “down,” and an, which means “to blow,” “to \nbreathe,” and “to live.”\nFigure 1.1  The cell’s membrane must balance contain-\nment (stability) with permeability.\n2\t\nYoga Anatomy\nIn the cell (and all living things, for that matter), the principle that balances permeability \nis stability. The yogic terms that reflect these polarities are sthira3 and sukha.4 All successful \nliving things must balance containment and permeability, rigidity and plasticity, persistence \nand adaptability, space and boundaries.5\nYou have seen that observing the cell, the most basic unit of life, illuminates the most basic \nconcepts in yoga: prana/apana and sthira/sukha. Next is an examination of the structure \nand function of the breath using these concepts as a guide.\nPrana and Apana\nThe body’s pathways for nutrients and waste are not as simple as those of a cell, but they \nare not so complex that you can’t grasp the concepts as easily.\nFigure 1.2 shows a simplified version of the nutritional and waste pathways. It shows how \nthe human system is open at the top and at the bottom. You take in prana, nourishment, in \nsolid and liquid form at the top of the system: It enters the alimentary canal, goes through \nthe digestive process, and after a lot of twists and turns, the resulting waste moves down \nand out. It has to go down to get out because the exit is at the bottom. So, the force of \napana, when it’s acting on solid and liquid waste, has to move down to get out.\nYou also take in prana in gaseous form: The breath, like solid \nand liquid nutrition, enters at the top. But the inhaled air remains \nabove the diaphragm in the lungs (see figure 1.3), where it \nexchanges gases with the capillaries at the alveoli. The waste \ngases in the lungs need to get out—but they need to get back \nout the same way they came in. This is why it is said that apana \nmust be able to operate freely both upward and downward, \ndepending on what type of waste it’s acting on. That is also \nwhy any inability to reverse apana’s downward push will result \nin an incomplete exhalation.\nThe ability to reverse apana’s downward action is a very \nbasic and useful skill that can be acquired through yoga train-\ning, but it is not something that most people are able to do \nright away. Pushing downward is the way that most people \nare accustomed to operating their apana because whenever \nthere’s anything within the body that needs to be disposed, \nhumans tend to squeeze in and push down. That is why most \nbeginning yoga students, when asked to exhale completely, will \nsqueeze in and push down their breathing muscles as if they’re \nurinating or defecating.\n3 The Sanskrit word sthira means “firm,” “hard,” “solid,” “compact,” “strong,” “unfluctuating,” “durable,” “lasting,” and \n“permanent.” English words such as stay, stand, stable, and steady are likely derived from the Indo-European root that gave \nrise to the Sanskrit term.\n4 The Sanskrit word sukha originally meant “having a good axle hole,” implying a space at the center that allows function; it \nalso means “easy,” “pleasant,” “agreeable,” “gentle,” and “mild.”\n5 Successful man-made structures also exhibit a balance of sthira and sukha; for example, a colander’s holes that are large \nenough to let out liquid, but small enough to prevent pasta from falling through, or a suspension bridge that’s flexible enough \nto survive wind and earthquake, but stable enough to support its load-bearing surfaces.\nFigure 1.2  Solid and liquid nutrition (blue) enter at the top of the \nsystem and exit as waste at the bottom. Gaseous nutrition and \nwaste (red) enter and exit at the top.\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n3\nSukha and Dukha\nThe pathways must be clear of obstructing forces \nin order for prana and apana to have a healthy \nrelationship. In yogic language, this region must \nbe in a state of sukha, which literally translates \nas “good space.” “Bad space” is referred to as \ndukha, which is commonly translated as “suf-\nfering.”6\nThis model points to the fundamental method-\nology of all classical yoga practice, which attends \nto the blockages, or obstructions, in the system \nto improve function. The basic idea is that when \nyou make more “good space,” your pranic forces \nwill flow freely and restore normal function. This \nis in contrast to any model that views the body \nas missing something essential, which has to be \nadded from the outside. This is why it has been \nsaid that yoga therapy is 90 percent about waste \nremoval.\nAnother practical way of applying this insight \nto the field of breath training is the observation: If you take care of the exhalation, the \ninhalation takes care of itself.\nBreathing, Gravity, and Yoga\nKeeping in the spirit of starting from the beginning, let’s look at some of the things that \nhappen at the very start of life.\nIn utero, oxygen is delivered through the umbilical cord. The mother does the breathing. \nThere is no air and very little blood in the lungs when in utero because the lungs are non-\nfunctional and mostly collapsed. The circulatory system is largely reversed, with oxygen-rich \nblood flowing through the veins and oxygen-depleted blood flowing through the arteries. \nHumans even have blood flowing through vessels that won’t exist after birth, because they \nwill seal off and become ligaments.\nBeing born means being severed from the umbilical cord—the lifeline that sustained \nyou for nine months. Suddenly, and for the first time, you need to engage in actions that \nwill ensure continued survival. The very first of these actions declares your physical and \nphysiological independence. It is the first breath, and it is the most important and forceful \ninhalation you will ever take in your life.\nThat first inhalation was the most important one because the initial inflation of the lungs \ncauses essential changes to the entire circulatory system, which had previously been geared \ntoward receiving oxygenated blood from the mother. The first breath causes blood to surge \ninto the lungs, the right and left sides of the heart to separate into two pumps, and the \nspecialized vessels of fetal circulation to shut down and seal off.\nThat first inhalation is the most forceful one you will ever take because it needs to over-\ncome the initial surface tension of your previously collapsed and amniotic-fluid-filled lung \nFigure 1.3  The pathway that air takes \ninto and out of the body.\n6 The Sanskrit word sukha is derived from su (meaning “good”) and kha (meaning “space”). In this context (paired with \ndukha), it refers to a state of well-being, free of obstacles. Like the “good axle hole,” a person needs to have “good space” \nat his or her center. The Sanskrit word dukha is derived from dus (meaning “bad”) and kha (meaning “space”). It is generally \ntranslated as “suffering”; also, “uneasy,” “uncomfortable,” “unpleasant,” and “difficult.”\n4\t\nYoga Anatomy\ntissue. The force required (called negative inspiratory force) is three to four times greater \nthan that of a normal inhalation.\nAnother first-time experience that occurs at the moment of birth is the weight of the body \nin space. Inside the womb, you’re in a weightless, fluid-filled environment. Then, suddenly, \nyour entire universe expands because you’re out—you’re free. Now, your body can move \nfreely in space, your limbs and head can move freely in relation to your body, and you must \nbe supported in gravity. Because adults are perfectly willing to swaddle babies and move \nthem from place to place, stability and mobility may not seem to be much of an issue so \nearly in life, but they are. The fact is, right away you have to start doing something—you \nhave to find nourishment, which involves the complex action of simultaneously breathing, \nsucking, and swallowing. All of the muscles involved in this intricate act of survival also \ncreate your first postural skill—supporting the weight of the head. This necessarily involves \nthe coordinated action of many muscles, and—as with all postural skills—a balancing act \nbetween mobilization and stabilization. Postural development continues from the head \ndownward, until you begin walking (after about a year), culminating with the completion \nof your lumbar curve (at about 10 years of age).\nTo summarize, the moment you’re born, you’re confronted by two forces that were not \npresent in utero: breath and gravity. To thrive, you need to reconcile those forces for as long \nas you draw breath on this planet. The practice of yoga can be seen as a way of consciously \nexploring the relationship between breath and posture, so it’s clear that yoga can help you \nto deal with this fundamental challenge.\nTo use the language of yoga, life on this planet requires an integrated relationship \nbetween breath (prana/apana) and posture (sthira/sukha). When things go wrong with \none, by definition they go wrong with the other.\nThe prana/apana concept is explored with a focus on the breathing mechanism. Chapter \n2 covers the sthira/sukha concept by focusing on the spine. The rest of the book examines \nhow the breath and spine come together in the practice of yoga postures.\nBreathing Defined\nBreathing is the process of taking air into and expelling it from the lungs. This is a good \nplace to start, but let’s define the “process” being referred to. Breathing—the passage of air \ninto and out of the lungs—is movement, one of the fundamental activities of living things. \nSpecifically, breathing involves movement in two cavities.\nMovement in Two Cavities\nThe simplified illustration of the human body in figure 1.4 shows that the torso consists \nof two cavities, the thoracic and the abdominal. These cavities share some properties, and \nthey have important distinctions as well. Both contain vital organs: The thoracic contains \nthe heart and lungs, and the abdominal contains the stomach, liver, gall bladder, spleen, \npancreas, small and large intestines, kidneys, and bladder, among others. Both cavities are \nbounded posteriorly by the spine. Both open at one end to the external environment—the \nthoracic at the top, and the abdominal at the bottom. Both share an important structure, the \ndiaphragm (it forms the roof of the abdominal cavity and the floor of the thoracic cavity).\nAnother important shared property of the two cavities is that they are mobile—they \nchange shape. It is this shape-changing ability that is most relevant to breathing, because \nwithout this movement, the body cannot breathe at all. Although both the abdominal and \nthoracic cavities change shape, there is an important structural difference in how they do \nso.\nThe abdominal cavity changes shape like a flexible, fluid-filled structure such as a water \nballoon. When you squeeze one end of a water balloon, the other end bulges. That is \n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n5\nbecause water is noncompressible. Your \nhand’s action only moves the fixed volume \nof water from one end of the flexible \ncontainer to the other. The same principle \napplies when the abdominal cavity is com-\npressed by the movements of breathing; a \nsqueeze in one region produces a bulge in \nanother. That is because in the context of \nbreathing, the abdominal cavity changes \nshape, but not volume.\nIn the context of life processes other \nthan breathing, the abdominal cavity does \nchange volume. If you drink a gallon of \nliquid or eat a big meal, the overall volume \nof the abdominal cavity will increase as \na result of expanded abdominal organs \n(stomach, intestines, bladder). Any \nincrease of volume in the abdominal cavity \nwill produce a corresponding decrease in \nthe volume of the thoracic cavity. That \nis why it’s harder to breathe after a big \nmeal, before a big bowel movement, or \nwhen pregnant.\nIn contrast to the abdominal cavity, the thoracic cavity changes both shape and volume; it \nbehaves as a flexible gas-filled container, similar to an accordion bellows. When you squeeze \nan accordion, you create a reduction in the volume of the bellows and air is forced out. When \nyou pull the bellows open, its volume increases and the air is pulled in. This is because the \naccordion is compressible and expandable. The same is true of the thoracic cavity, which, \nunlike the abdominal cavity and its contents, can change its shape and volume.\nVolume and Pressure\nVolume and pressure are inversely related: When volume increases, pressure decreases, \nand when volume decreases, pressure increases. Because air always flows toward areas of \nlower pressure, increasing the volume inside the thoracic cavity (think of an accordion) will \ndecrease pressure and cause air to flow into it. This is an inhalation.\nIt is interesting to note that in spite of how it feels when you inhale, you are not pulling \nair into the body. On the contrary, air is pushed into the body by atmospheric pressure that \nalways surrounds you. The actual force that gets air into the lungs is outside of the body. \nThe energy you expend in breathing produces a shape change that lowers the pressure \nin your chest cavity and permits the air to be pushed into the body by the weight of the \nplanet’s atmosphere.\nLet’s now imagine the thoracic and abdominal cavities as an accordion stacked on top of a \nwater balloon. This illustration gives a sense of the relationship of the two cavities in breath-\ning; movement in one will necessarily result in movement in the other. Recall that during \nan inhalation (the shape change permitting air to be pushed into the lungs by the planet’s \natmospheric pressure), the thoracic cavity expands its volume. This pushes downward on \nthe abdominal cavity, which changes shape as a result of the pressure from above.\nDuring relaxed, quiet breathing (such as while sleeping), an exhalation is a passive reversal \nof this process. The thoracic cavity and lung tissue—which have been stretched open during \nthe inhalation—spring back to their initial volume, pushing the air out and returning the \nthoracic cavity to its previous shape. This is referred to as a passive recoil. Any reduction \nFigure 1.4  Breathing is thoracoabdominal shape \nchange. Inhalation on left, exhalation on right.\n6\t\nYoga Anatomy\nin the elasticity of these tissues will result in a reduction of the body’s ability to exhale pas-\nsively—leading to a host of respiratory problems.\nIn breathing patterns that involve active exhaling (such as blowing out candles, speak-\ning, and singing, as well as various yoga exercises), the musculature surrounding the two \ncavities contracts in such a way that the abdominal cavity is pushed upward into the tho-\nracic cavity, or the thoracic cavity is pushed downward into the abdominal cavity, or any \ncombination of the two.\nThree-Dimensional Shape Changes of Breathing\nBecause the lungs occupy a three-dimensional space in the thoracic cavity, when this space \nchanges shape to cause air movement, it changes shape three-dimensionally. Specifically, \nan inhalation involves the chest cavity increasing its volume from top to bottom, from side \nto side, and from front to back, and an exhalation involves a reduction of volume in those \nthree dimensions (see figure 1.5).\nFigure 1.5  Three-dimensional thoracic shape changes of (a) inhalation and (b) exhalation.\nBecause thoracic shape change is \ninextricably linked to abdominal shape \nchange, you can also say that the \nabdominal cavity also changes shape \n(not volume) in three dimensions—it \ncan be pushed or pulled from top to \nbottom, from side to side, or from front \nto back (see figure 1.6). In a living, \nbreathing body, thoracic shape change \ncannot happen without abdominal shape \nchange. That is why the condition of the \nabdominal region has such an influence \non the quality of your breathing and \nwhy the quality of your breathing has \na powerful effect on the health of your \nabdominal organs.\nFigure 1.6  Changes in abdominal shape \nduring breathing: (a) Inhalation = spinal \nextension; (b) exhalation = spinal flexion.\nb\na\nb\na\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n7\nExpanded Definition of Breathing\nBased on the information you have so far, here’s an expanded definition of breathing:\nBreathing, the process of taking air into and expelling it from the lungs, is caused by a \nthree-dimensional changing of shape in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\nDefining breathing in this manner explains not only what it is but also how it is done. \nThis has profound implications for yoga practice, because it can lead you to examine the \nsupporting, shape-changing structure that occupies the back of the body’s two primary \ncavities—the spine, which is covered in chapter 2.\nTo understand how a single muscle, the diaphragm, is capable of producing all this move-\nment, you now examine it in detail.\nDiaphragm’s Role in Breathing\nJust about every anatomy book describes the diaphragm as the principal muscle of breathing. \nAdd the diaphragm to the shape-change definition of breathing to begin your exploration \nof this remarkable muscle:\nThe diaphragm is the principal muscle that causes three-dimensional shape change in \nthe thoracic and abdominal cavities.\nTo understand how the diaphragm causes this shape change, you will examine its shape \nand location in the body, where it’s attached, and what is attached to it, as well as its action \nand relationship to the other muscles of breathing.\nShape and Location\nThe diaphragm divides the torso into the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It is the floor of \nthe thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity. Its structure extends through a \nwide section of the body—the uppermost part reaches the space between the third and \nfourth ribs, and its lowest fibers attach to the front of the third lumbar vertebra; “nipple to \nnavel” is one way to describe it.\nThe deeply domed shape of the diaphragm has evoked \nmany images. Some of the most common are a mushroom, a \njellyfish, a parachute, and a helmet. It’s important to note that \nthe shape of the diaphragm is created by the organs it encloses \nand supports. Deprived of its relationship with those organs, its \ndome would collapse, much like a stocking cap without a head \nin it. It is also evident that the diaphragm has an asymmetrical \ndouble-dome shape, with the right dome rising higher than the \nleft. This is because the liver pushes up from below the right \ndome, and the heart pushes down from above the left dome.\nOrigin and Insertion\nThe lower edges of the diaphragm’s circumference originate \nfrom three distinct regions: the bottom of the sternum, the base \nof the rib cage, and the front of the lower spine (see figure 1.7). \nThese three regions form a continuous rim of attachment for \nthe diaphragm. The only bony components of this rim are the \nback of the xiphoid process and the front surfaces of the first \nthree lumbar vertebrae. The majority of the diaphragm (over \n90 percent) originates on flexible tissue: the costal cartilage of \nribs 6 through 10 and the arcuate ligaments, which bridge the \nspan from the 10th rib’s cartilage to the floating 11th and 12th \nribs and from there to the spine.\nFigure 1.7  Origin and \ninsertion of the diaphragm \nmuscle.\n8\t\nYoga Anatomy\nAll the muscular fibers of the diaphragm rise upward in the body from their origins. They \neventually arrive at the flattened, horizontal top of the muscle, the central tendon, into \nwhich they insert. In essence, the diaphragm inserts into itself—its own central tendon, \nwhich is fibrous noncontractile tissue.\nOrganic Connections\nThe central tendon of the diaphragm is a point of anchorage for the connective tissue that \nsurrounds the thoracic and abdominal organs. The names of these important structures are \neasily remembered as the three Ps.\n•\tPleura, which surround the lungs\n•\tPericardium, which surrounds the heart\n•\tPeritoneum, which surrounds the abdominal organs\nThus, it should be clear that the shape-changing activity of these cavities has a profound \neffect on the movements of the organs they contain. The diaphragm is the primary source \nof these movements, and the relationship of its healthy functioning to the well-being of \nthe organs is anatomically evident.\nActions\nIt is important to remember that the muscular fibers of the diaphragm are oriented primarily \nalong the vertical (up–down) axis of the body, and this is the direction of the muscular action \nof the muscle. Recall that the horizontal central tendon is noncontractile and can move only \nin response to the action of the muscular fibers, which insert into it (see figure 1.8).\nAs in any other muscle, the contracting fibers of the diaphragm pull its insertion and \norigin (the central tendon and the base of the rib cage) toward each other. This muscle \naction is the fundamental cause of the three-dimensional thoracoabdominal shape changes \nof breathing.\nTo understand this fact more deeply, the question of whether origin moves toward inser-\ntion, or insertion moves toward origin, needs to be clarified. As with all muscles, the type \nof movement the diaphragm produces will \ndepend on which end of the muscle is stable \nand which is mobile. To use an example of \nanother muscle, the psoas muscle can create \nhip flexion either by moving the leg toward \nthe front of the spine (as in standing on one \nleg and flexing the other hip) or by moving \nthe front of the spine toward the leg (as in \nsit-ups with the legs braced). In both cases, \nthe psoas muscle is doing the same thing—\ncontracting. What differs is which end of the \nmuscle is stable and which is mobile.\nJust as you can think of the psoas as \neither a “leg mover” or a “trunk mover,” \nyou can think of the diaphragm as either \na “belly bulger” or a “rib cage lifter” (see \nfigure 1.9). The muscular action of the  \ndiaphragm is most often associated with a \nFigure 1.8   The muscle fibers of the dia-\nphragm all run vertically from their origins to \ntheir insertion on the central tendon.\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n9\nbulging7 movement in the upper abdomen, \nwhich is commonly referred to as a “belly \nbreath,” but this is only the case if the \ndiaphragm’s origin (the base of the rib cage) \nis stable and its insertion (the central tendon) \nis mobile (see figure 1.10a).\nIf the central tendon is stabilized and \nthe ribs are free to move, a diaphragmatic \ncontraction will cause an expansion of the \nrib cage (see figure 1.10b). This is a “chest \nbreath,” which many people believe must \nbe caused by the action of muscles other \nthan the diaphragm. This mistaken idea can \ncreate a false dichotomy between diaphrag-\nmatic and “nondiaphragmatic” breathing. \nThe unfortunate result of this error is that \nmany people receiving breath training who \nexhibit chest movement (rather than belly \nmovement) are told that they are not using \nthe diaphragm, which is false. Except in \ncases of paralysis, the diaphragm is always \nused for breathing. The issue is whether it is \nbeing used efficiently.\n7 Even though most teachers refer to this diaphragmatic action as an “expansion” of the abdomen, this is incorrect. In the \ncontext of breathing, the abdominal cavity does not change volume—only shape; therefore it is more accurate to refer to this \nmovement as a “bulging” of the upper abdomen.\nFigure 1.9  The diaphragm can be (a) a “belly \nbulger,” during the belly inhalation, or (b) a “rib \ncage lifter,” during the chest inhalation.\nb\na\nFigure 1.10  (a) With the rib stable and the abdominals relaxed, the diaphragm’s contraction \nlowers the central tendon. (b) With the rib cage relaxed and the central tendon stabilized by \nabdominal action, the contracting diaphragm lifts the rib upward.\nb\na\nCentral tendon\n10\t\nYoga Anatomy\nIf it were possible to release all of the diaphragm’s stabilizing muscles and allow its origin \nand insertion to freely move toward each other, both the chest and abdomen would move \nsimultaneously. This rarely occurs because the need to stabilize the body’s mass in gravity \nwill cause many of the respiratory stabilizing muscles (which are also postural muscles) to \nremain active through all phases of breathing.\nEngine of Three-Dimensional Shape Change\nThe diaphragm is the prime mover of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The specific \npatterns that arise in yoga asana practice or breathing exercises, however, result from the \naction of muscles other than the diaphragm that can change the shape of the cavities. \nThese are called accessory muscles. The analogy of a car and its engine is very useful in \nexplaining this principle.\nThe engine is the prime mover of the car. All the movements associated with a car’s \noperation (including the electrical) are generated in the engine. In the same manner, the \nthree-dimensional, thoracoabdominal shape change of breathing is primarily generated by \nthe diaphragm.\nWhen you drive, the only direct control you exert over the function of the engine is the \nspeed of its spinning. You push the gas pedal to make the engine spin faster, and you release \nthe pedal to make it spin slower. Similarly, the only direct volitional control you have over \nthe diaphragm is its timing.\nYou don’t steer your car with its engine. To control the power of the engine and guide \nit in a particular direction, you need the mechanisms of the transmission, brakes, steering, \nand suspension. In the same way, you don’t “steer” your breathing with the diaphragm. To \ncontrol the power of the breath, and guide it into specific patterns, you need the assistance \nof the accessory muscles.\nFrom the standpoint of this engine analogy, the whole notion of “diaphragmatic training” \nas a way to improve breath function is flawed. After all, you don’t become a better driver \nby learning only how to work the gas pedal. Most of the skills you acquire in driver training \nhave to do with getting the acceleration of the car to coordinate with steering, braking, and \nshifting gears. In a similar way, breath training is really “accessory muscle training.” Once \nall the other musculature of the body is coordinated and integrated with the action of the \ndiaphragm, breathing will be efficient and effective.\nAdditionally, the notion that that diaphragmatic action is limited to abdominal bulging \n(belly breathing) is as inaccurate as asserting that a car’s engine is only capable of making \nit go forward—and that some other source of power must govern reverse movement. Just \nas this automotive error is linked to not understanding the relationship of the car’s engine \nto its transmission, the breathing error results from not understanding the relationship of \nthe diaphragm to the accessory muscles.\nMoreover, equating belly movement with proper breathing and chest movement with \nimproper breathing is just as silly as stating that a car is best served by only driving forward \nat all times. Without the ability to reverse its movements, a car would eventually end up \nsomeplace it couldn’t get out of.\nAccessory Muscles of Respiration\nAlthough there is universal agreement that the diaphragm is the principal muscle of breath-\ning, there are various, sometimes conflicting ways of categorizing the other muscles that \nparticipate in breathing. Using the definition of breathing as thoracoabdominal shape change, \nyou can define any muscle other than the diaphragm that can cause a shape change in the \ncavities as accessory (see figures 1.11 and 1.12 for example). It’s irrelevant whether the \nshape change leads to an increase or a decrease of thoracic volume (inhalation or exhala-\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n11\ntion), because both sets of muscles can be active during any phase of breathing. An example \nwould be the analysis of a belly breath or a chest breath.\nIn the belly breath, the costal circumference (origin) of the diaphragm is stabilized by the \nmuscles that pull the rib cage downward: the internal intercostals, the transversus thoracis, \nand others (see figures 1.13 to 1.16). These muscles are universally classified as “exhaling \nmuscles,” but here they actively participate in shaping an inhalation. In the chest breath, \nthe central tendon (insertion) of the diaphragm is stabilized by the abdominal muscles, also \nregarded as “exhaling muscles,” but in this case, they are clearly acting to produce a pattern \nof inhaling. It should be noted that in both of these cases, one region of accessory muscle \nhas to be relaxed while the other is active. In the belly breath, the abdominal wall releases, \nand in the chest breath, the rib cage depressors have to let go.\nFigure 1.11  The intercostal muscles assist the sliding action of the ribs during respiration. During \ninhalation (a), the external intercostals contract, and the internal intercostals relax. During exhala-\ntion (c), the opposite occurs.\nFigure 1.12  Contrary to appearances, the intercostal spaces remain constant during respiratory \nmovements. Rather, the ribs slide in relation to each other—as indicated by the misaligning of the \nred line.\nb\na\nc\nAbdominal and Thoracic Accessory Muscles\nThe abdominal cavity and its musculature can be imagined as a water balloon surrounded \non all sides by elastic fibers running in all directions. The shortening and lengthening of \nthese fibers in coordination with the contractions of the diaphragm produce the infinitely \nvariable shape changes associated with respiration. As the tone of the diaphragm increases \n(inhalation), the tone of some abdominal muscles must decrease to allow the diaphragm to \nmove. If you contract all your abdominal muscles at once and try to inhale, you’ll notice that \nit’s quite difficult because you’ve limited the ability of your abdomen to change shape.\nInhalation\nContract\nRelax\nNeutral\nExhalation\nb\na\nc\nInhalation\nNeutral\nExhalation\n12\t\nYoga Anatomy\nThe abdominal group doesn’t affect breathing only by limiting or permitting shape change \nin the abdominal cavity. Because they also attach directly to the rib cage, the abdominal \nmuscles directly affect its ability to expand.\nThe abdominal muscles that have the most direct effect on breathing are the ones that \noriginate at the same place as the diaphragm, the transversus abdominis (see figure 1.13). \nThis deepest layer of the abdominal wall arises from the costal cartilage at the base of the \nrib cage’s inner surface. The fibers of the transversus are interdigitated (interwoven) at right \nangles with those of the diaphragm, whose fibers ascend vertically, whereas those of the \ntransversus run horizontally (see figure 1.14). This makes the transversus abdominis the \ndirect antagonist to the diaphragm’s action of expanding the rib cage. The same layer of \nhorizontal fibers extends upward into the posterior thoracic wall as the tranversus thoracis, \na depressor of the sternum.\nThe other layers of the abdominal wall have similar counterparts in the thoracic cavity. The \nexternal obliques turn into the external intercostals, and the internal obliques turn into the \ninternal intercostals (see figure 1.13). Of all these thoracoabdominal layers of muscle, only \nthe external intercostals are capable of increasing thoracic volume. All the others produce \na reduction of thoracic volume—either by depressing the rib cage or pushing upward on \nthe central tendon of the diaphragm.\nFigure 1.13  The continuity of the abdominal and intercostal layers shows how the external \nobliques turn into the external intercostals, internal obliques turn into the internal intercostals, and \nthe transversus abdominis turns into the transversus thoracis and innermost intercostals.\nFigure 1.14  Posterior view of the chest wall, showing the interdigitated origins of the diaphragm and \ntransversus abdominis forming perfect right angles with each other. This is clearly an agonist/antago-\nnist, inhale/exhale muscle pairing that structurally underlies the yogic concepts of prana/apana.\nTransversus thorasis\nTransversus abdominis\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n13\nOther Accessory Muscles\nChest, neck, and back muscles can expand the rib \ncage (see figures 1.15 and 1.16), but they are far \nmore inefficient than the diaphragm and external \nintercostals at doing this. This inefficiency is the \nresult of the fact that the location and attachment \nof these muscles do not provide enough leverage \non the rib cage, and the usual role of these mus-\ncles is not respiration. They are primarily neck, \nshoulder girdle, and arm mobilizers—actions that \nrequire them to be stable proximally (toward the \ncore of the body) and mobile distally (toward \nthe periphery of the body). For these muscles \nto expand the rib cage, this relationship must be \nreversed—the distal insertions must be stabilized \nby yet more muscles so the proximal origins can \nbe mobilized.\nConsidering the degree of muscular tension \nthat accessory breathing entails, the net payoff \nin oxygenation makes it a poor energetic invest-\nment. That is why improved breathing is really \na result of decreased tension in the accessory \nmechanism, which allows the diaphragm, with its \nshape-changing ability, to operate as efficiently \nas possible.\nThe Other Two Diaphragms\nAlong with the respiratory diaphragm, breathing \ninvolves the coordinated action of the pelvic and \nvocal diaphragms. Of particular interest to yoga \npractitioners is the action of mula bandha, which \nis a lifting action produced in the pelvic floor \nmuscles (shown in figure 1.17, a and b) that also \nincludes the lower fibers of the deep abdominal \nlayers. Mula bandha is an action that moves \napana upward and stabilizes the central tendon \nof the diaphragm. Inhaling while this bandha is \nactive requires a release of the attachments of \nthe upper abdominal wall, which permits the \ndiaphragm to lift the base of the rib cage upward. \nThis action is referred to as uddiyana bandha \n(uddiya means “flying upward”).\nIt’s important to note that the more superficial \nmuscular fibers of the perineum need not be \ninvolved in mula bandha, because they contain \nthe anal and urethral sphincters, which are asso-\nciated with the downward movement of apana \n(elimination of solid and liquid waste), as shown \nin figure 1.18.\nFigure 1.15  Some of the accessory \nmuscles of respiration: Blue muscles act \nto reduce thoracic volume, while red \nmuscles help to increase thoracic volume.\nFigure 1.16  The serratus posterior mus-\ncles: superior (red) assist thoracic volume \nexpansion, inferior (blue) assist thoracic \nvolume reduction.\n14\t\nYoga Anatomy\nVocal Diaphragm\nThe gateway to the respiratory passages is the glottis, shown in figure 1.19, which is not a \nstructure but a space between the vocal folds (cords). Yoga practitioners are accustomed \nto regulating this space in various ways, based on what they are doing with their breath, \nvoice, and posture. When at rest, the muscles that control the vocal cords can be relaxed \nso that the glottis is being neither restricted nor enlarged (see figure 1.20a). This occurs in \nsleep and in the more restful, restorative practices in yoga.\nWhen doing breathing exercises that involve deep, rapid movements of breath (such as \nkapalabhati or bhastrika), the muscles that pull the vocal folds apart contract to create a \nlarger passage for the air movements (see figure 1.20b). When the exercises call for long, \ndeep, slow breaths, the glottis can be partially closed, with only a small opening at the back \nof the cords (see figure 1.20c). This is the same action that creates whispered speech; in \nyoga it’s known as ujjayi,8 “the victorious breath.”\nFigure 1.17  (a) The deepest muscles of the pelvic diaphragm, from above. (b) The pelvic floor \nfrom below, showing the orientation of superficial and deeper layers. The more superficial the layer, \nthe more it runs from side to side (ischia to ischia); the deeper the layer, the more it runs front to \nback (pubic joint to coccyx).\nb\na\nFigure 1.18  The action of the more superficial perineal fibers (figure 1.17b) are associated with \nthe anal and urogenital sphincters and the downward movement of apana (i.e., the elimination \nof solid and liquid waste). The action of deeper fibers of the pelvic diaphragm (figure 1.17a) are \nassociated with the upward movement of apana (i.e., the elimination of gaseous waste through \nexhalation).\n8 U denotes udana, which refers to the upward flowing prana in the throat region. Jaya means “victory.”\n\t\ndynamics of breathing\t\n15\nWhen making sound and during the chanting practices of yoga, the cords are pulled \ntogether into the phonation position (see figure 1.20d). The air pushing its way through \nthem vibrates, creating sound. The pitch (and to some extent the length) of the sound is \ndetermined by how much tension is used to hold the cords together.\nFigure 1.20  Position and location of vocal folds: (a) relaxed position, (b) maximal opening for \nforced respiration, (c) slightly opened for whispered speech (or ujjayi), (d) closed for speaking \n(phonation).\nFigure 1.19  The pathway of air (in blue) into and out of the lungs.\nb\na\nc\nd\n16\t\nYoga Anatomy\nThe Bandhas\nAll three diaphragms (pelvic, respiratory, and vocal) plus ujjayi come together in yoga move-\nments that are coordinated with inhaling and exhaling. In addition to giving more length and \ntexture to the breath, the “valve” of ujjayi creates a kind of back pressure throughout the \nabdominal and thoracic cavities that can protect the spine during the long, slow flexion and \nextension movements that occur in vinyasas such as the sun salutations. In yogic terms, these \nactions of the diaphragms (bandhas) create more sthira (stability) in the body, protecting \nit from injury by redistributing mechanical stress. An additional effect of moving the body \nthrough this resistance is the creation of heat in the system, which can be used in many \nbeneficial ways. These practices are referred to as brahmana,9 which implies heat, expan-\nsion, and the development of power and strength as well as the ability to withstand stress. \nBrahmana is also associated with inhaling, nourishment, prana, and the chest region.\nWhen relaxing the body in the more supported, horizontal, restorative practices, remember \nto release the bandhas and glottal constrictions that are associated with vertical postural \nsupport. This relaxing side of yoga embodies the qualities of langhana,10 which is associ-\nated with coolness, condensation, relaxation, and release as well as the development of \nsensitivity and inward focus. Langhana is also associated with exhaling, elimination, apana, \nand the abdominal region.\nBecause the ultimate goal of yoga breath training is to free up the system from habitual, \ndysfunctional restrictions, the first thing you need to do is free yourself from the idea that \nthere’s a single right way to breathe. As useful as the bandhas are when supporting your \ncenter of gravity and moving the spine through space, you need to release the forces of \nsthira in the system when pursuing the relaxation and release of sukha.\nIf yoga practice leads you to more integrated, balanced breathing, it’s because it trains \nyour body to freely respond to the demands that you place on it in the various positions \nand activities that make up your daily life.\n9 The Sanskrit root brh can mean “to grow great or strong,” “increase,” “to make big or fat or strong,” and “expand.”\n10 Langhana is a term that originates in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, and it refers to practices such as \nfasting that reduce, or eliminate, elements from the system.\n17\nyoga and the spine\n17\n2\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\nT\nhe central nervous system, with its complex sensory and motor functions, allows for \nan enormous amount of flexibility in a vertebrate’s survival activities. As these systems \nevolved over millions of years and became more crucial to the survival of our early ances-\ntors, they required the corresponding development of a protective structure that allows for \nfree movement but is stable enough to offer protection to these vital yet delicate tissues. \nThat structure, the skeletal spine, is perhaps nature’s most elegant and intricate solution to \nthe dual demands of sthira and sukha.\nThe human spine is unique among all mammals in that \nit exhibits both primary and secondary curves. The primary \ncurve of the spine comprises the kyphotic thoracic and \nsacral curves; the secondary, lordotic curves are present \nin the cervical and lumbar regions (see figure 2.1). Only a \ntrue biped requires both pairs of curves; tree-swinging and \nknuckle-walking primates have some cervical curve, but no \nlumbar lordosis, which is why they can’t walk comfortably \non two legs for long.\nThe primary (kyphotic) curve was the first front–back1 \nspinal curve to emerge as aquatic creatures made the tran-\nsition to land. As a human awaits its emergence from its \nwatery origins in utero, the entire spine is in a primary curve \n(see figure 2.2). It changes shape for the first time when the \nhead negotiates the hairpin curve of the birth canal and the \nneck experiences its secondary (lordotic) curve for the very \nfirst time2 (see figure 2.3).\nAs your postural development proceeds from the head \ndownward, the cervical curve continues to develop after you \nlearn to hold up the weight of your head at about three to \nfour months and fully forms at around nine months, when \nyou learn to sit upright (see figure 2.4).\nAfter crawling and creeping on the floor for months, you \nmust acquire a lumbar curve to bring your weight over the \nfeet. At 12 to 18 months, as you begin to walk, the lumbar \nspine straightens out from its primary, kyphotic curve. By \n3 years of age, the lumbar spine starts to become concave \nforward (lordotic), although this won’t be outwardly visible \nuntil 6 to 8 years of age. It is only after the age of 10 that \nthe lumbar curve fully assumes its adult shape.\nFigure 2.1  The curves of the \nspinal column.\n1 The lateral undulations that propel fish, snakes, and lizards through their environments cease to be useful for a creature that \nsupports its belly off the ground on four limbs. The successful early quadrupeds would have been those that arched their bellies \naway from the earth so that their weight-bearing and movement forces were distributed into the limbs and away from the \nvulnerable center of the spine.\n2 This parallels the fact that the cervical spine was the site of the first development of a secondary curve as our quadrupedal \nancestors found a survival benefit to lifting their heads and gazing from the ground immediately in front of them, out to the \nhorizon.\nCervical\nThoracic\nLumbar\nSacral\n18\t\nYoga Anatomy\nThe full glory of nature’s ingenuity is apparent in the human spine—more so than in any \nother vertebrate structure. From an engineering perspective, it’s clear that humans have the \nsmallest base of support, the highest center of gravity, and the heaviest brain (proportional \nto total body weight3) of any other mammal. As the only true biped mammals on the planet, \nhumans are also earth’s least mechanically stable creatures. Fortunately, the disadvantage \nof having a bowling-ball-weighted cranium balancing on top of the whole system is offset \nby the advantage of having that big brain; it can figure out how to make the whole thing \nwork efficiently—and that’s where yoga can help.\nThe human form in general, and the spine in particular, exhibits an extraordinary resolu-\ntion between the contradictory requirements of rigidity and plasticity. As you will see in \nthe next section, the structural balancing of the forces of sthira and sukha in your living \nbody relates to a principle called intrinsic equilibrium—a deep source of support that can \nbe uncovered through yoga practice.\nFigure 2.3  The first emergence of the second-\nary curve: negotiating the 90-degree turn from \nthe cervix into the vaginal passage.\nFigure 2.4  Development of primary and secondary curves.\n3 The blue whale has the biggest brain on the planet, but it comprises only .01 percent of its total body weight. Humans top the \nlist at 1.9 percent, with the rat a close second at 1.5 percent.\nFigure 2.2  The entire spine exhibiting the pri-\nmary curve in utero.\nBirth\n3 to 9 months\n1 to 3 years\n6 to 10 years\n\t\nyoga and the spine\t\n19\nIntrinsic Equilibrium\nIf you were to remove all the muscles that attach to the spine, it still would not collapse. \nWhy? Intrinsic equilibrium is the concept that explains not only why the spine is a self- \nsupporting structure but also why any spinal movement produces potential energy that \nreturns the spine to neutral. The same arrangement exists in the rib cage and pelvis, which, \nlike the spine, are bound together under mechanical tension. This fact about the core \nstructures of the axial skeleton reveals a deeper truth about how yoga practice appears to \nliberate potential energy from the body.\nTrue to the principles of yoga and yoga therapy, the most profound changes occur when \nthe forces obstructing that change are reduced. In the case of intrinsic equilibrium, a deep \nlevel of built-in support for the core of the body is involved. This built-in support does not \ndepend on muscular effort because it is derived from the relationships between the non-\ncontractile tissues of cartilage, ligament, and bone. Consequently, when this support asserts \nitself, it is always because some extraneous muscular effort has ceased to obstruct it.\nIt takes a lot of energy to fuel our constant, unconscious muscular exertions against \ngravity, and that is why the release of that effort is associated with a feeling of liberated \nenergy. Thus, it is tempting to refer to intrinsic equilibrium as a source of energy because its \ndiscovery is always accompanied by a profound sensation of increased vitality in the body. \nIn short, yoga can help you to release the stored potential energy of the axial skeleton by \nidentifying and releasing the less efficient extraneous muscular effort that can obstruct the \nexpression of those deeper forces.\nElements of Linkage Between the Vertebrae\nThe spinal column as a whole is ideally constructed to neutralize the combination of com-\npressive and tensile forces to which it is constantly subjected by gravity and movement. The \n24 vertebrae are bound to each other with intervening zones of cartilaginous discs, capsular \njoints, and spinal ligaments (shown schematically in blue in figure 2.5). This alternation of \nbony and soft tissue structures represents a distinction between passive and active elements; \nthe vertebrae are the passive, stable elements (sthira), and the active, moving elements \n(sukha) are the intervertebral discs, facet (capsular) joints, and a network of ligaments that \nconnect the arches of adjacent vertebrae (figure 2.6). The intrinsic equilibrium of the spinal \ncolumn can be found in the integration of these passive and active elements.\nFigure 2.6  Ligaments of the spine.\nFigure 2.5  Alternating zones of hard \nand soft tissue in the spinal column.\n20\t\nYoga Anatomy\nTo understand the overall architecture of the spine, \nit is useful to view it as two separate columns. In the \nschematic side view in figure 2.7, its front-to-back \ndimension can be roughly divided in half between a \ncolumn of vertebral bodies and a column of arches.\nFunctionally, this arrangement very clearly evolved \nto contend with the dual requirements of stability and \nplasticity. The anterior column of vertebral bodies \ndeals with weight-bearing, compressive forces, \nwhereas the posterior column of arches deals with \nthe tensile forces generated by movement. Within \neach column, in the dynamic relationship of bone to \nsoft tissue, there is a balance of sthira and sukha. The \nvertebral bodies transmit compressive forces to the \ndiscs, which resist compression by pushing back. The \ncolumn of arches transmits tension forces to all the \nattached ligaments (figure 2.8), which resist stretch-\ning by pulling back. In short, the structural elements \nof the spinal column are involved in an intricate dance \nthat protects the central nervous system by neutral-\nizing the forces of tension and compression.\nFigure 2.7  Viewed from the side, \nthe spine divided into an anterior \ncolumn of vertebral bodies and \ndiscs, and a posterior column of \narches and processes.\nb\na\nFigure 2.8  (a) Superior view of spinal ligaments, and (b) lateral view of spinal ligaments.\nDiscs and Ligaments\nIf you look deeper, you can also see how sthira and sukha are revealed in the components \nof an intervertebral disc: The tough, fibrous layers of the annulus fibrosis tightly enclose \nthe soft, spherical nucleus pulposus. In a healthy disc, the nucleus is completely contained \nall around by the annulus and the vertebra (see figure 2.9). The annulus fibrosis is itself \ncontained front and back by the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, with which \nit is closely bonded (see figure 2.8).\nThis tightly contained arrangement results in a strong tendency for the nucleus to always \nreturn to the center of the disc, no matter in which direction the body’s movements propel \nit.\nSupraspinous ligament\nInterspinous ligament\nLigamentum flavum\nFacet joint capsule\nIntertransverse ligament\nPosterior longitudinal ligament\nIntervertebral disc\nAnterior longitudinal ligament\n\t\nyoga and the spine\t\n21\nVertebral Structure\nFrom the top of the cervical spine to the base \nof the lumbar spine, individual vertebrae are \ndramatically different in shape based on the \nfunctional demands of the varying regions of \nthe spine (figure 2.10). There are, however, \ncommon elements to all vertebral structure, \nas illustrated by the schematic representation \nin figure 2.11.\nWeight-bearing activities in general, as well \nas axial rotation (twisting movements), produce \nsymmetrical (axial) compressive forces that flat-\nten the nucleus into the annulus, which pushes \nback, resulting in a decompressive reaction (see \nfigure 2.12). If the compressive force is high \nenough, rather than rupture, the nucleus will \nlose some of its moisture to the porous bone of \nthe vertebral body. When the weight is taken \noff the spine, the hydrophilic nucleus draws the water back in, and the disc returns to its \noriginal thickness. That is why humans are a bit taller right after getting out of bed.\nFigure 2.10  The changing shape of the vertebrae.\nFigure 2.9  The nucleus pulposus is tightly \nbound by the annulus fibrosis, which con-\ntains concentric rings of oblique fibers that \nalternate their direction—similar to the \ninternal and external abdominal obliques.\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC7\nT1\nT10\nT12\nL1\nL5\n22\t\nYoga Anatomy\nThe movements of flexion, extension, and lateral flexion produce asymmetrical move-\nments of the nucleus, but the result is the same: Wherever the vertebral bodies move toward \neach other, the nucleus is pushed in the opposite direction, where it meets the counterpush \nof the annulus, which causes the nucleus to push the vertebral bodies back to neutral (see \nfigure 2.13).\nAssisting in this counterpush are the long ligaments that run the entire length of the \nspine, front and back. The anterior longitudinal ligament runs all the way from the upper \nfront of the sacrum to the front of the occiput, and it is fixed tightly to the front surface \nof each intervertebral disc. When it is stretched during backward bending, not only does \nFigure 2.11  Common elements of a vertebra’s structure.\nFigure 2.12  Weight-bearing forces (a) as well as twisting (b) produce symmetrical compression \n(flattening) of the nucleus, which, under pressure from the annulus, returns to its spherical shape, \nthus decompressing the vertebrae.\nFigure 2.13  Flexion (a) and extension (b) movements produce asymmetrical movements of the \nnucleus, which, under pressure from the annulus, returns to a central position, thus helping the \nspine to return to neutral.\nb\na\nb\na\nVertebral body\nArticular process\nTransverse process\nSpinous process\nPedicle\nLamina\nIntervertebral disc\nFacet joint\n\t\nyoga and the spine\t\n23\nit tend to spring the body back to neutral, but the increased tension at its attachment to \nthe disc also helps to propel the nucleus back to neutral. The opposite action occurs in the \nposterior longitudinal ligament when it is stretched in a forward bend. It runs from the back \nof the sacrum to the back of the occiput.\nEvery movement that produces disc compression in the anterior column necessarily results \nin tension to corresponding ligaments attached to the posterior column. The recoiling of \nthese ligaments out of their stretched state adds to the other forces of intrinsic equilibrium, \nwhich combine to return the spine to neutral.\nNote that all this activity occurs in tissues that behave independently of the circulatory, \nmuscular, and voluntary nervous systems. In other words, their actions do not present an \nenergy demand on these other systems.\nTypes of Spinal Movement\nThere are generally thought to be four possible movements of the spine: flexion, exten-\nsion, axial rotation (twisting), and lateral flexion (side bending). These four movements \noccur more or less spontaneously in the course of life: as you bend over to tie your shoes \n(flexion), reach for something on a high shelf \n(extension), grab a bag in the car seat behind \nyou (axial rotation), or reach your arm into the \nsleeve of an overcoat (lateral flexion). There \nare, of course, yoga postures that emphasize \nthese movements as well.\nA more thorough look into the nature of the \nfour ranges of motion of the spine shows that \nthere is a fifth possibility called axial extension. \nThis motion doesn’t happen spontaneously in \nthe normal course of daily movements. You \nhave to learn how to make it happen inten-\ntionally because it is somewhat unnatural.\nFlexion and Extension, the \nPrimary and Secondary Curves, \nand Inhalation and Exhalation\nThe most basic movement of the spine is the \none that emphasizes its primary curve: flexion. \nAs discussed previously, the primary curve is \nthe kyphotic curve present primarily in the \nthoracic spine, but it is also obvious in the \nshape of the sacrum. It’s no accident that the \nyoga pose that most completely exemplifies \nspinal flexion is called the child’s pose (see \nfigure 2.14)—it replicates the primary curve \nof the unborn child. From a certain perspec-\ntive, all the curves of the body that are convex \nposteriorly can be seen as reflections of the \nprimary curve. A simple way to identify all \nthe primary curves is to notice all the parts of \nthe body that contact the floor in savasana, \nor corpse pose (see figures 2.15 and 2.16): \nFigure 2.14  Child’s pose replicates the pri-\nmary curve of the unborn child.\nFigure 2.15  In corpse pose, the primary \ncurves of the body contact the floor.\n24\t\nYoga Anatomy\nthe curve of the back of the head, the upper back, the sacrum, the backs of the thighs, the \ncalves, and the heels. Consequently, the secondary curves are present in all the body parts \nthat are off the floor in this position: the cervical and lumbar spine, the backs of the knees, \nand the space posterior to the Achilles tendons.\nFrom this perspective, spinal flexion can be defined as an increase in the primary spinal \ncurves and a decrease in the secondary spinal curves. A reversal of this definition would \ndefine spinal extension as an increase in the secondary curves and a decrease in the primary \ncurves.\nNote that as far as movement is concerned, the relationship between the primary and \nsecondary curves is reciprocal: The more you increase or decrease one, the more the other \nwill want to do the opposite. For example, an increase in thoracic kyphosis automatically \nproduces a decrease in cervical and lumbar lordosis.\nThe classic yoga exercise that explores this reciprocal relationship of the primary and \nsecondary curves is cat/cow, or chakravakasana (see figure 2.17).\nFigure 2.16  Savasana seen from below, showing spinal origins of the autonomic nervous \nsystem—sympathetic from the thoracic and parasympathetic from cervical and sacral regions.\nFigure 2.17  The cat/cow pose emphasizes both the primary and secondary curves.\nb\na\nCat\nCow\n\t\nyoga and the spine\t\n25\nSupported at both ends by the arms and thighs, the spine’s curves can move freely in both \ndirections, producing the shape changes of flexion and extension. Although it is common \nto teach this movement by telling the student to exhale on spinal flexion and inhale on \nextension, it is more accurate to say that spinal flexion is an exhalation and spinal extension \nis an inhalation. As the definition of breathing shows, spinal shape change is synonymous \nwith breathing shape change (see figure 1.6 on page 6).\nM o v e m e n t  E x p l o r at i o n\nFrom a comfortable sitting position, try increasing your thoracic kyphosis by drop-\nping your chest forward. Notice how your neck and lower back flatten. Now, try the \nsame movement, but initiate it with your head; if you drop your head forward, you’ll \nnotice how the chest and lower spine will follow. The same will occur if you initiate \nthis movement with your lower spine. You may also notice that these flexion move-\nments of the spine generally tend to create an exhalation.\nGoing in the opposite direction, try decreasing your thoracic kyphosis by lifting your \nchest. Notice how your neck and lower back increase their curves. If you try initiating \nit with your head or lower spine, the results will be the same. Did you notice how \nthese extension movements of the spine tend to create an inhalation?\nSpatial and Spinal Perspectives in Forward- and Backward-Bending \nPoses\nSpinal extension is not necessarily the same thing as bending backward, and spinal flex-\nion is not necessarily the same thing as bending forward. In order to avoid confusion, it’s \nimportant to keep these distinctions clear. Flexion and extension refer to the relationship \nof the spinal curves to each other, while forward bending and backward bending are terms \nthat refer to movements of the body in space. The terms are not interchangeable. By way \nof illustration, picture the following contrasting examples of how two different body types \nwould move into and out of a standing overhead reach:\nA stiff, sedentary office worker, whose stooped posture doesn’t change as his hips move \nforward and his arms reach overhead in an attempt to do a standing backbend. His spine \nis remaining in flexion while his body is moving backward in space.\nA flexible dancer, who hyperextends her spinal curves in the overhead reach, and keeps her \nspine extended as she flexes forward at the hip joints to move into uttanasana (standing forward \nbend). Her spine is remaining in extension while her body is bending forward in space.\nThe valuable skill in observing movements like this is the ability to distinguish movement \nof the spinal curves in relation to each other from the movements of the torso in space.\nFigure 2.18 shows more of an integrated orientation to a standing backbend. Here, the \nsecondary curves are kept under control, and the pelvis is kept firmly over the feet. As a result, \nthere is much less movement backward in space, but a greater emphasis on thoracic extension \n(reduction of the primary curve). Although this is not a dramatic movement spatially, it will actu-\nally provide a safe and effective stretch to the thoracic and rib structures and will be less disturbing \nto the process of breathing than either the dancer’s or the office worker’s movements.\nSpatial and Spinal Perspectives in Lateral and Twisting Movements\nWhen looking at yoga poses that involve lateral and twisting movements, it’s also important \nto distinguish spatial from spinal perspectives. Triangle (trikonasana) is a pose that is often \nreferred to as a lateral stretch, and this is true insofar as it lengthens the connective tissue \npathway that runs along the side of the body (see figure 2.19).\n26\t\nYoga Anatomy\nIt is, however, possible to lengthen the lateral line of the body without any appreciable \nlateral flexion of the spine, so again, we need to be clear what exactly is meant by a term \nlike “lateral bend.”\nIn trikonasana, more of a lateral line stretch would result from a wide spacing of the feet, \nand an intention to initiate the movement primarily from the pelvis while maintaining the \nspine in neutral extension. This also turns the pose into more of a hip-opener.\nLateral flexion of the spine could be emphasized by a closer spacing of the feet, which \nallows for more stabilization of the relationship between the pelvis and thighs, which would \nrequire the movement to come from the lateral bending of the spine.\nSticking with the example of triangle pose, if we look at its revolved variation in figure \n2.20, we can apply the same perspective to the twisting action of the spine. The lumbar \nspine is almost entirely incapable of axial rotation (only 5 degrees), which, in this pose, means \nthat it will go wherever the sacrum leads it. Consequently, for the lower spine to twist in the \ndirection of this pose, the pelvis would have to turn in the same direction.\nIf the hips are restricted, the lumbar spine will appear to be moving in the opposite \ndirection of the rib cage and shoulder girdle rotation, and when this is the case, most of \nthe twist will originate from first joints above the sacrum that can freely rotate: the lower \nthoracics, T11-T12 and above. In addition, the twisting of the shoulder girdle around the rib \ncage can create the illusion that the spine is twisting more than it really is. So, the body can \nindeed be twisting in space, but a careful observation of the spine may tell where exactly \nthe twisting is (or is not) coming from.\nIf the pelvis is free to rotate around the hip joints, this pose will exhibit a more evenly \ndistributed twist throughout the spine (rather than an overloading of T11 and T12). The \nFigure 2.18  An integrated orientation to \na standing backbend.\nFigure 2.19  Trikonasana.\n\t\nyoga and the spine\t\n27\nlumbar spine will fully participate because the pelvis and sacrum are also turning; the neck \nand shoulders will be free, and the rib cage, upper back, and neck will be open, along with \nthe breathing.\nAxial Extension, Bandhas, and Mahamudra\nAxial extension, the fifth spinal movement, is defined as a simultaneous reduction of both \nthe primary and secondary curves of the spine (see figure 2.21). In other words, the cervi-\ncal, thoracic, and lumbar curves are all reduced, and the result is that the overall length of \nthe spine is increased.\nFigure 2.21  Axial extension involves a simultaneous reduction of the primary and secondary curves, \nwhich lengthens the spinal column beyond its neutral alignment.\nFigure 2.20  Parivrtta trikonasana.\n28\t\nYoga Anatomy\nBecause the primary and secondary curves have a reciprocal relationship, which is \nexpressed in the “natural” movements of flexion and extension, axial extension is “unnatu-\nral” in the sense that it bypasses this reciprocal relationship by reducing all three curves at \nonce. In other words, axial extension doesn’t happen all on its own; it requires conscious \neffort and training to accomplish.\nThe action that produces axial extension involves a shift in the tone and orientation of \nthe breathing structures known as the bandhas. The three diaphragms (pelvic, respiratory, \nand vocal) and their surrounding musculature become more sthira (stable). As a result, the \nability of the thoracic and abdominal cavities to change shape is more limited in axial exten-\nsion. The overall effect is a reduction of breath volume but an increase in length.\nThe overall yogic term that describes this state of the spine and breath is mahamudra, \nwhich always involves axial extension and the bandhas. It is possible to do mahamudra from \nmany positions, including seated, standing, supine, and in arm supports.\nA seated posture named mahamudra (see figure 2.22) adds a twisting action to axial \nextension. It is considered a supreme accomplishment to do this practice with all three band-\nhas executed correctly, because it represents a complete merging of asana and pranayama \npractice.\nFigure 2.22  Mahamudra combines axial extension and a twisting action.\n29\nunderstanding the asanas\n29\n3\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\nD\neciding which anatomical details of yoga poses to depict is quite a challenge. Unlike \nweight training and stretching, which focus on specific muscles, yoga focuses on asanas \nthat are whole-body practices; no elements are entirely passive.1\nRespecting the principles of yoga previously discussed, I have attempted a reconciliation \nof opposing imperatives in selecting the following information. I have tried to be system-\natic, but not formulaic, taking each posture on its own unique terms, while providing some \nconsistency in the format of the page spreads and the information provided.\nBecause yoga practice is fundamentally experiential, the information in this book is \nintended to be an inspiration to explore your own body. Perhaps you will understand more \nclearly something you’ve experienced as a result of reviewing this material. On the other \nhand, some anatomical detail may capture your interest and move you to investigate it \nthrough a pose that’s being depicted. In either case, this book will have served its purpose \nif it supports you in these explorations.\nStarting Positions and the Base of Support\nThe poses in this book are arranged by their starting position. Every unusual position of the \nbody has to begin with a usual position. The five “usual positions” are commonly referred \nto as the starting positions. Any asana you can think of has one of these common positions \nas its starting point:\nStanding—supported on the soles of your feet (page 33)\nSitting—supported on the base of your pelvis (page 79)\nKneeling—supported on your knees, shins, and tops of feet (page 119)\nSupine—supported on the back surface of your body (page 135)\nProne—supported on the front surface of your body (page 163)\nWithin each asana section is at least one forward bend, backbend, twist, lateral bend, \nand axial extension. The selections include the postures that are most commonly practiced \nby the majority of teaching traditions.\nRelated to the issue of starting position is the concept of the base of support. This refers \nto the parts of the body that are on the ground and through which the weight-bearing forces \nare transmitted down to the earth, resulting in some supporting energy generated upward \ninto the body. Anatomically, only the feet—supporting the legs and pelvis—have evolved \nspecifically to accomplish this. That is perhaps why the simple standing poses are considered \nthe starting point for all asana practice by most yoga traditions. The lessons you learn from \nstanding on the earth can be applied to any other base of support you may experience.\nThe structures in the body that most closely resemble the feet and legs are, of course, the \nhands and arms. When you employ them to create a base of support, you do arm supports, \nwhich are covered in a chapter all their own on page 175.\n1 Even savasana (the corpse pose), requiring complete relaxation of all the skeletal muscles, has an active component: The mind \nis intentionally focused on the process of breathing and relaxation—otherwise it’s just napping.\n30\t\nYoga Anatomy\nInformation for Each Pose\nWith occasional variation, each pose description includes the following sections:\n•\t Name. Each asana is presented with its Sanskrit name and its translated English name. \nAdditionally, some descriptive text is added to clarify the meaning or context of the pose’s \nname.\n•\t Classification and level. Poses are classified by their base of support, spinal action, \nand level of difficulty.\n•\t Key structures. For each asana, at least three key structures are highlighted. These \nmay be anatomical elements that the pose brings into greater focus or function. They could \nalso be less obvious body parts that can provide a deeper action than you would ordinarily \nnotice. Additionally, a particular asana description might discuss an interesting anatomical \nobservation that could just as easily apply to several other postures.\n•\t Key joint and limb actions. The joints and limbs that are involved in the asana are \nidentified according to their actions: flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation, and \nso forth.\n•\t Working and lengthening. In the performance of any yoga asana, the most prominent \nsensations are generated by the lengthening and working of the skeletal muscles. Many \ntimes, muscles have to work and lengthen simultaneously to do the poses. For each pose, \nsome element of that component is depicted and analyzed. The key muscles for each pose \nare discussed.\n•\t Breathing. Breathing is the changing of shape of the body cavities. Each yoga posture \npresents a specific shape-changing challenge to the respiratory mechanism. Many postures \nare presented with notes on these underlying breathing patterns and suggestions on how \nto use the breath to get the most out of the posture’s effects.\n•\t Obstacles and notes. From a certain perspective, yoga is the practice of uncovering and \nresolving obstructions in the human system. Practicing yoga asanas is a systematic way of \nencountering those obstacles in the most perceptually accessible aspect of our system—the \nphysical body. Presented are the most common obstacles to achieving each of the pictured \nasanas, along with some useful suggestions for overcoming them.\n•\t Cautions. Certain poses present potential risk to specific body parts or to particular \npeople. These are pointed out where applicable.\n•\t Variations. For certain asanas, key variations are pictured and explained.\n•\t Special notes. Here, wherever it’s needed, are notes that don’t fit into any of the other \ncategories. This could include comments about the asana’s terminology, history, mythology, \nor any other contextual information.\nTypes of Muscle Contractions\nIn the “Working and Lengthening” sections in the next chapters, four types of muscle \ncontractions are referred to:\nConcentric—The length of the muscle decreases during a contraction.\nEccentric—The length of the muscle increases during a contraction.\nIsometric—The length of the muscle remains constant during a contraction against \nresistance, and the intention is to not move.\nIsotonic—The length of the muscle remains constant during a contraction against \nresistance, and the intention is to move.\n\t\nunderstanding the asanas\t\n31\nAn understandable question that could arise is: “Since the poses are all static, why \nwouldn’t all the muscles just be doing isometric contractions?”2 The short answer to this \nquestion is that the text is describing how to come into a pose from a starting position, \nrather than how to be in a pose. In other words, look at an asanas as a process rather than \nas a final product.\nMost often an image of an asana depicts the end point of a movement. Even if you stay \nin a pose for a period of time, the muscle actions that got you there from the starting point \n(standing, sitting, kneeling, and so on) are still present. In addition, the movements of the \nbreathing structures never cease. In yoga poses, we experience a cross section of a never-\nending progression of movement and breath, extending infinitely forward and backward \nin time.3 As long as we are in this matrix of space and time, we will never actually be still, \nand our full action potential will be present and accessible.\nThe Drawings\nThe asana images in this book are based on photographs of various models that were taken \nduring several sessions. Some of the perspectives are quite unusual, because they were shot \nfrom below using a large sheet of plexiglass, or from above using a ladder.\nThe photos were used as reference for the anatomical illustrator, who posed her skeleton \nin the various positions and sketched the bones by hand. After a round of corrections, the \n2 “Each bodily movement is embedded in a chain of infinite happenings from which we distinguish only the immediate \npreceding steps and, occasionally, those which immediately follow” (Laban 1966, p. 54). For reference to “isometric” versus \n“stabilizing isotonic,” see Adler, Beckers, and Buck, 2003.\n3 A memorable description of this concept is contained in Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, in which he describes the \nTralfamadorians, who live in the fourth dimension. When they look at a person, they see a very long, four-dimensional \ncaterpillar, with tiny newborn legs at one end and withered, elderly legs at the other end. Human beings, lacking the fourth \ndimension of perception, can only see a three-dimensional cross section of the caterpillar.\nYoga Anatomy photo shoot at The Breathing Project in New York City. Leslie Kaminoff (far left) \nsupervises as project photographer, Lydia Mann, shoots Derek’s Bakasana from below the plexi-\nglass. Janet and Elizabeth stabilize the ladders. The final artwork from the resulting photo is on \npage 186.\n32\t\nYoga Anatomy\nmuscles and other structures were added using computer software, and several more rounds \nof corrections and adjustments were made to produce the final images.\nThe labeling of the structures in each drawing, as well as the various arrows and other \nindicators, were added last.\nstanding poses\n33\n4\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\nW\nhen you stand, you bear weight on the only structures in the body that have specifi-\ncally evolved to hold you up in the uniquely human stance—the feet. The architecture \nof the feet, along with their musculature, shows nature’s unmatched ability to reconcile and \nneutralize opposing forces.\nClearly, however, these amazing structures are massively overengineered for the way \nmost people use them in the civilized world of stiff shoes and paved surfaces. Fortunately, \nyoga exercises are done barefoot, with much attention given to restoring the strength and \nflexibility of the foot and lower leg muscles.\nIn yoga practice, some of the earliest lessons frequently center on the simple act of stand-\ning upright—something you’ve been doing (more or less successfully) since you were about \na year old. If you can feel your weight releasing into the three points of contact between \nthe foot and the earth, you may be able to feel the support that the earth gives back to you \nthrough the action of the three arches of the foot and the muscles that control them.\nStanding positions have the highest center of gravity of all the starting points, and the \neffort of stabilizing that center makes standing poses—by definition—brahmana. Release \nand support, giving and receiving, inhaling and exhaling—Patanjali’s formulation of sthiram \nsukham asanam encompasses all of these and more.1\nThe fundamental lessons you learn from standing postures can illuminate the practice \nof all the other asanas.\n1 Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra, II.1. T.K.V. Desikachar’s translation sums it up well when he defines sthiram as “alertness without \ntension” and sukham as “relaxation without dullness.”\n34\nTadasana\nMountain Pose\ntah-DAHS-anna\ntada = mountain\nThis pose’s name evokes many images that relate to a stable, rooted base of sup-\nport and a “crown” that reaches for the heavens.\n35\nClassification and Level\nEasy standing pose\nKey Structures\nIntrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles, quadriceps, iliopsoas, piriformis, abdomi-\nnal wall, diaphragm.\nJoint Actions\nThe lumbar, thoracic, and cervical curves are in mild axial extension.\nThe ankle, hip, shoulder, and wrist joints are in their neutral positions, midway \nbetween flexion and extension.\nThe knee joints are extended (but not hyperextended); the elbow joints are \nextended and the forearms are pronated.\nThe arches of the feet are lifted and connecting with the upward lifting action \nin the pelvic floor, the lower abdomen, rib cage, cervical spine, and the top \nof the head.\nThe shoulder blades are dropped onto the support of the rib cage and con-\nnect with the downward release of the tailbone and the grounding of the \nthree points of contact between each foot and the floor.\nNotes\nNothing lasting can be built on a shaky foundation. This may be why tadasana \nis considered by many yoga traditions to be the starting point of asana practice. \nInterestingly, this pose is almost identical to the “anatomical position”—the start-\ning reference point for the study of movement and anatomy. The only major dif-\nference between the two positions is that in tadasana, the palms of the hands are \nfacing the sides of the thighs rather than forward.\nNonmuscular support and padding for the foot: the fat pads (yellow) and plantar fascia \n(blue). The muscles of the foot occupy the space between the plantar fascia and the bones.\n(continued)\n36\nThis body position is also uniquely human, because humans are the only true \nbiped mammals on the planet. Humans are also the least stable of creatures, pos-\nsessing the smallest base of support, the highest center of gravity, and (propor-\ntionately) the heaviest brain balancing atop it all.\nThe base of support of this pose—the feet—offers a beautiful image of how the \npassive and active forces of release and support operate in the human system. The \nessential structure of the foot can be represented by a triangle. The three points of \nthe triangle are the three places where the foot’s structure will rest on a supporting \nsurface: the calcaneal tuberosity, the base of the first metatarsal, and the base of \nthe fifth metatarsal. The lines connecting these points represent the arches—three \nlines of lift through which postural support is derived: the medial longitudinal arch, \nthe lateral longitudinal arch, and the transverse (metatarsal) arch.\nFrom underneath, the two triangles of the feet can be joined to show the size \nand shape of the base of support for tadasana. The “plumb line” that passes \nthrough the body’s center of gravity in this position should also fall through the \nexact center of this base.\nTriangles represent the three points of \nsupport of each foot.\nThe three arches of the foot.\nThe four layers of musculature (see top figure on page 37) all combine to \ncreate lift, balance, and movement of the 28 bones of the foot, which has \nevolved to be an incredibly adaptable structure able to move you smoothly \nthrough space over uneven terrain.\nThe foot has evolved over millions of years in a world with no roads or side-\nwalks. In today’s world in which many uneven surfaces have been leveled and \npaved, it’s clearly overengineered. When the adaptability of the foot is no longer \nneeded for locomotion, the deeper muscles that support the arches inevitably \nweaken, eventually leaving only the superficial, noncontractile plantar fascia \nresponsible for preventing the total collapse of the foot. This frequently leads to \nplantar fasciitis and heel spurs.\nThe practice of standing postures in general, and tadasana in particular, is one \nof the best ways to restore the natural aliveness, strength, and adaptability of the \nfeet. Once your foundation is improved, it’s much easier to put the rest of your \nhouse in order.\nTadasana  (continued)\n37\nFoot bones from below (left) and above (right). The “X” marks the point where the weight \nof the body transfers through the tibia to the talus bone, and from there to the calcaneus.\nThe plantar fascia—the most superficial layer of support for the foot. The more the arch \nsupport muscles weaken, the more pressure is put on the plantar fascia, which can result in \nplantar fasciitis and heel spurs.\nFour layers of musculature, deepest on the right and most superficial on the left.\nAbductor \nhallucis\nFlexor \ndigitorum \nbrevis\nAbductor \ndigiti minimi\nFlexor hallucis longus\nLumbricals\nFlexor \ndigitorum \nlongus\nQuadratus \nplantae\nInterosseus \nmuscles\nAdductor hallucis\nFlexor \nhallucis \nbrevis\nFlexor digiti \nminimi\n(continued)\nBase of \ntibia\nCalcaneus\nTalus\n38\nTadasana Variation\nSamasthiti\nEqual Standing, Prayer Pose\nsama = same, equal\nsthiti = to establish, to stand\nTadasana  (continued)\n39\nSamasthiti has a wider, more stable \nbase than tadasana because the feet \nare placed with the heels under the sit-\nting bones rather than touching each \nother. All the standing poses that are \nexecuted from this base, as opposed to \ntadasana, consequently have a wider, \nmore stable base of support. This is \ntypically done in the vinyasa styles, in \nwhich breath-coordinated movement \nis the focus, rather than the alignment-\noriented approaches, in which static \nmaintenance of positions is preferred.\nAdditionally, the head is lowered \nand the hands are in namaste (prayer) \nposition. This is typical of the starting \npoint of a sun salutation, a prayerful \nvinyasa that is used by many systems of hatha yoga as a warm-up and to con-\nnect asanas into a flowing sequence.\nTerminology Note\nIn the Ashtanga tradition of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, the term samasthiti refers to \nwhat is here described as tadasana. In the teaching tradition of Sri T. Krishnam-\nacharya and his son, T.K.V. Desikachar, the term tadasana refers to a standing \npose with the arms overhead, and balancing on the balls of the feet.\nCautions\nPeople with headache, insomnia, and low blood pressure should exercise caution \nwhen performing prolonged standing poses.\nBase for support of samasthiti.

Otherwise, the body’s oxygen \ndemands will make the breath too labored to continue to maintain the axial \nextension.\nObstacles\nTight latissimus dorsi, weak quadriceps, knees falling out of alignment, over-\narching lumbar spine (hence, psoas minor and abdominal muscles), over-\nflexing hips (hence, hamstrings, to resist the quadriceps’ tendency to pull \nthe sitting bones away from the backs of the knees).\nNotes\nKnees are vulnerable in this position (partly flexed), particularly the menisci, if \nthere is excessive knee rotation.\nGravity should be the main source of resistance in the pose, not the resistance \nof agonist and antagonist contraction. Beginning students in this asana tend to \nfeel a lot heavier than their weight because of this.\n42\nUttanasana\nStanding Forward Bend\nOOT-tan-AHS-anna\nut = intense\ntan = stretch\nGastrocnemius\nSpinal \nextensors\nHamstrings\nPiriformis\nClassification and Level\nEasy standing pose, forward \nbend\nKey Structures\nHip joint, legs, spine.\nJoint Actions\nHip flexion, knee extension, \nmild spinal flexion (the \ntighter the hamstrings, the \nmore the spinal flexion).\nWorking\nUpper body: Gravity.\nLower body: Vastus medialis, \nintermedius, lateralis (knee \nextensors); articularis genus \n(to draw up on the capsule \nof the knee joint); feet and \nankles (for balance).\nLengthening\nSpinal muscles, hamstrings, \nposterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus, gluteus maximus, pirifor-\nmis, adductor magnus, soleus, gastrocnemius.\nBreathing\nDeep hip flexion compresses the abdomen. This combined with gravity moves \nthe center of the diaphragm cranially, so more freedom is needed in the back of \nthe rib cage for the movement of the breath.\n43\nObstacles\nTightness in hamstrings, spinal muscles, gluteals.\nCautions\nPeople with back injury, osteoporosis, or both should approach deep forward \nbending very cautiously and gradually.\nPeople with high blood pressure (hypertension) should go into this pose \ngradually and remain in it only if their breathing is not strained. People with low \nblood pressure (hypotension) should come out of this pose very slowly, because \nthey may become dizzy.\nNotes\nIn this pose, gravity should do the \nwork. People experiencing tightness \nin the back of the legs sometimes \npull themselves down, which cre-\nates tightness and congestion in \nthe rectus femoris and psoas. It’s \nbetter to soften the knees to find \nsome space in the hip joint, allow-\ning the spine to release. Only then \ndoes lengthening the legs produce \nan even stretch along the entire back \nline of the body.\nFor more anatomy, and the seated \nversion of this pose, see paschimot-\ntanasana, page 82.\nIf the hamstrings are tight, slightly bending the \nknees helps release the spine.\nBiceps femoris\nAdductor \nmagnus\nGracilis\nGastrocnemius\nPiriformis\nSoleus\nSpinal extensors\nQuadriceps\nTibialis \nanterior\nPsoas \nmajor\nGluteus \nmaximus\nHamstrings\nGastrocnemius\nDiaphragm\n44\nUtthita Hasta Padangusthasana\nExtended Hand–Toe Pose or Standing Big Toe Hold\noo-TEE-tah HA-sta pad-an goosh-TAHS-anna\nutthita = extended\nhasta = hand\npada = foot\nangusta = big toe\nDeltoid \nPronator teres \nFlexor carpi radialis\nPalmaris longus\nPsoas major \nFlexor carpi \nulnaris\nHamstrings\nIliacus\nVastus \nmedialis\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis\nQuadratus \nlumborum\nPiriformis\nSuperior \ngemellus\nObturator \ninternus\nInferior \ngemellus\nFlexor \ndigitorum \nlongus\nGluteus \nmedius\nGluteus \nmaximus\nGracilis \nAdductor \nmagnus\nTibialis \nposterior\nFlexor \nhallucis \nlongus\n45\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate asymmetrical standing balance pose\nJoint Actions\nNeutral spine, pelvis level, shoulder flexion, elbow extension, finger flexion. \nStanding leg: neutral hip extension, knee extension (not locked). Lifted leg: \nhip flexion, knee extension.\nWorking\nStanding leg, spine, and pelvis: Quadriceps and hamstrings on the standing \nleg; spinal extensors, to keep from flexing the spine and tucking the pelvis; \nabductors and external rotators, eccentrically, to keep the pelvis level; \nexternal and internal obliques; rotary muscles of the back (obliques, trans-\nversospinalis), to counter the rotation created by the arm holding the toe.\nLifted leg: Flexors of the shoulder and fingers to hold the big toe and create \nhip flexion; psoas major and iliacus, rectus femoris, pectineus, adductor \nbrevis and longus (to help with hip flexion).\nLengthening\nLifted leg: Hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, gluteus maximus.\nObstacles\nTightness in the hamstrings or gluteus maximus in the lifted leg can cause spinal \nflexion, and thus hip extension or knee flexion in the standing leg. It’s better to \nbend the knee in the lifted leg and find neutral curves in the spine and neutral \nextension in the standing hip, and knee extension (but not hyperextension) in \nthe standing leg.\nNotes\nWeakness in standing leg abductors can create “hip hike” on the side of the \nlifted leg, leading to overwork of the quadratus lumborum.\nWeakness in the hip flexors (psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris) can also \ncause overwork in the quadratus lumborum and hip hike.\nBreathing\nIn maintaining this balance pose, the stabilizing action in the abdominal muscles \ncombines with the bracing action of the arms to create an overall reduction of \nbreathing capacity. If there is excessive muscular tension, the reduced volume of \nbreath will not be sufficient to fuel the effort, and the increased volume of breath \nwill tend to compromise the balance.\n46\nClassification and Level\nBasic asymmetrical standing balance\nKey Structures\nLower leg, foot, arch, abductors, and external rotators of the standing leg; \nexternal and internal obliques, to stabilize torso to pelvis.\nTensor \nfascia lata\nVastus lateralis\nVastus medialis\nTibialis \nanterior\nPsoas major\nIliacus\nPectineus\nAdductor longus\nSartorius\nGracilis\nGastrocnemius\nSoleus\nVrksasana\nTree Pose\nvrik-SHAHS-anna\nvrksa = tree\nRectus femoris\n47\nJoint and Limb Actions\nNeutral spine, level pelvis. Standing leg: hip neutral extension, internal rota-\ntion, adduction; knee extension (not locked). Lifted leg: hip flexion, exter-\nnal rotation, abduction; knee flexion; tibia external rotation; ankle dorsi-\nflexion (pressed against the adductors of the standing leg); foot pronation.\nWorking\nLifted leg: Iliacus and psoas major, all external rotators and extensors—glu-\nteus maximus, posterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus, piriformis, \nadductor magnus (extensor portion), obturator internus and externus, \ngemelli, quadratus femoris.\nStanding leg: Piriformis, tensor fascia lata, gluteus medius and minimus, glu-\nteus maximus (extensor portion).\nStanding foot: Intrinsic muscles of the foot, muscles of the ankle and lower leg.\nLengthening\nLifted leg: Pectineus, adductor longus and brevis, gracilis.\nStanding leg: Gluteus medius and minimus, piriformis (working eccentrically).\nNotes\nThe adductors lengthen to get into position; they may have some role in holding \nthe leg in place by pressing the foot into the inside of the standing leg. Misusing \nthe pectineus to hold the leg in place creates flexion at the hip, tilting the pelvis \nand rotating the leg inward.\nAbductors on the standing leg are working eccentrically; if they are weak or \ntight, the hip of the lifted leg will “hike up,” or the rotators will try to stabilize \nthe pelvis and the pelvis will rotate open.\nThe more strength and adaptability you have in the feet and ankles, the more \noptions you will have for finding balance.\nBreathing\nCompared to tree pose with arms elevated (next variation) or utthita hasta \npadangusthasana (the toe-hold posture), the upper body is freer to participate in \nrespiratory movements in this pose. With the arms held quietly in namaste, and \nthe raised leg braced against the adductors of the standing leg, the attention and \ncenter of gravity are drawn inward and downward.\nCautions\nPeople with inner ear or balance disorders (benign positional vertigo, Ménière’s \ndisease) should practice standing balances near a wall for extra security and  \nsupport.\n(continued)\n48\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate asymmetrical standing balance pose\nJoint Actions\nNeutral spine; scapula upward rotation, abduction, elevation; glenohumeral \nexternal rotation, abduction; elbow extension; forearm pronation (if the \nupper arm is externally rotated).\nSuperior gemellus\nObturator internus\nInferior gemellus\nAdductor magnus\nFlexor digitorum longus\nTibialis posterior\nFlexor hallucis longus\nVrksasana  (continued)\nVrksasana Variation\nTree Pose With Arms Elevated\nPiriformis\nIliotibial band\n49\nWorking\nInfraspinatus, teres minor, deltoids, supraspinatus, long head biceps, serratus \nanterior (supported by the upper fibers of the trapezius), triceps with anco-\nneus to extend elbows.\nLengthening\nLatissimus dorsi, teres major, long head triceps.\nObstacles and Notes\nOveruse of the latissimus dorsi to “pull shoulders down the back” interferes with \nthe elevation of the scapulae; it can create impingement at the acromion of the \nbiceps tendon and supraspinatus. The rib cage can also be pushed forward from \na restriction of the latissimus.\nThis variation creates a higher center of gravity by placing the arms overhead, \nand is therefore categorized as an intermediate-level balancing asana.\nBreathing\nBecause of the stabilizing action of the muscles that keep the arms overhead, the \nthoracic movements of the breath encounter more resistance in this position. In \naddition, the higher center of gravity will tend to produce a stronger stabilizing \naction in the abdominal muscles. Taken together, these factors combine to reduce \nthe overall excursion of the diaphragm; therefore, quiet, efficient breathing is the \nmost appropriate pattern. Breaths that are too deep will destabilize the posture.\n50\nClassification and Level\nAsymmetrical standing balancing pose\nTrapezius\nInfraspinatus\nTeres minor\nTeres major\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nGluteus \nmedius\nAdductor magnus\nQuadratus \nlumborum\nSerratus \nanterior\nGarudasana\nEagle Pose\ngah-rue-DAHS-anna\ngaruda = a fierce bird of prey, the vehicle (vahana) of the Hindu god Vishnu,  \nusually described as an eagle, but sometimes as a hawk or kite\nSerratus \nanterior\n51\nJoint Actions\nMild spinal flexion; scapula abduction, upward and lateral rotation, elevation; \nglenohumeral external rotation; elbow flexion; forearm pronation; neutral \nwrist extension; pelvis anterior tilt, counternutation; hip flexion, internal \nrotation, adduction; knee flexion, internal rotation; ankle dorsiflexion; \nfoot—lifted in eversion, standing in slight supination.\nWorking\nArm position: Infraspinatus (both working and lengthening), serratus anterior, \npectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, pronator teres and pronator \nquadratus.\nLeg position: Gluteus medius and minimus (anterior fibers), tensor fascia \nlatae, adductor magnus, gluteus medius and minimus also working to sta-\nbilize the standing hip.\nLengthening\nArm position: Because of the abduction of the scapulae—rhomboids, lower \ntrapezius, teres major, and latissimus dorsi (slightly); infraspinatus, triceps \n(slightly).\nLeg position: Gluteus maximus, piriformis, quadratus femoris, obturator inter-\nnus, posterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus.\nObstacles and Notes\nThe scapulae need to be able to both abduct and rotate laterally. If the scapulae \nare too “pulled down,” the spine will have to contort to achieve the entwined \nposition.\nBoth the standing and the lifted leg need to internally rotate and adduct in this \nposition.\nTo achieve the full entwining, the standing leg needs to flex at the hip and \nknee. This position of hip flexion with internal rotation and adduction is not \nstructurally easy (the fibers of the hip joint capsule make it easier to internally \nrotate when the hip is in extension). The adduction with internal rotation espe-\ncially gets to the piriformis. This position can be overmobilizing for the knees; if \nthe hips are too tight to achieve the actions, the knees can be forced to overro-\ntate. This action is stabilizing for the sacroiliac joint.\nBreathing\nThis is the most “compacted” of the one-legged balancing postures, from the \nstandpoint of both the shape and center of gravity, and the breathing. The \nentwining of the arms compresses the rib cage, and the hip flexion, combined \nwith the mild spinal flexion, compresses the lower abdomen.\n52\nGastrocnemius\nDeltoid\nTeres minor\nHamstrings\nSerratus anterior\nSpinal extensors\nVastus \nlateralis\nGluteus \nmaximus\nVastus medialis\nRectus femoris\nPsoas minor \nRectus \nabdominis\nPectoralis \nmajor\nRectus \nabdominis\nObliques\nTensor \nfascia lata\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis\nVastus \nmedialis\nSubscapularis\nSerratus \nanterior\nIntercostals\nPsoas \nminor\nPsoas major\nNatarajasana\nKing of the Dancers Pose\nnot-ah-raj-AHS-anna\nnata = dancer\nraja = king\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced backbending standing balance\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension; scapula upward rotation, abduction, and elevation; arm flex-\nion; elbow flexion; and forearm supination. Standing leg: hip flexion, knee \nextension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Lifted leg: hip extension, knee flexion, \nand ankle plantarflexion.\nWorking\nArms: The serratus anterior works to wrap the scapula around the rib cage; \nthe infraspinatus and teres minor externally rotate the glenohumeral joint; \nand the deltoids lift the arms into position. The supraspinatus and subscap-\nularis are also active to help hold the head of the humerus in its socket.\nSpine: The intrinsic extensor muscles of the spine—intertransversarii, interspi-\nnalis, rotatores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius capitis and cervicis, \n53\nlongissimus, and iliocostalis—are all active in creating and maintaining \nspinal extension. The psoas minor, rectus abdominis, and obliques should \nall work eccentrically against the action of the spinal extensors to prevent \ntoo much action in the lumbar spine, and move more action into thoracic \nspinal extension and hip extension.\nStanding leg: The gluteus medius and minimus and the tensor fascia latae \nwork eccentrically to keep the pelvis level. The quadriceps extend the \nknee, and the hamstrings lengthen (if there’s enough range of motion in \nthe hamstrings, they might work eccentrically to resist tipping too far for-\nward). The muscles of the feet and forelegs are active for balance.\nLifted leg: The hamstrings create hip extension and knee flexion, and the \nvastii come into isometric or concentric action as knee extensors as the \npose deepens, to increase the hip extension against the resistance of the \nhand on the foot. The adductor magnus is active as both an adductor and \nhip extensor, and the gluteus maximus (though not as an external rotator).\nLengthening\nArms: Rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, triceps, pectoralis major.\nSpine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, intercostals.\nStanding leg: Hamstrings, abductors (working eccentrically).\nLifted leg: Iliacus, psoas major, rectus femoris.\nObstacles and Notes\nScapula mobility is important in this “full-arm” version—both for getting the arm \ninto position without overmobilizing the glenohumeral joint and for mobility in \nthe thoracic spine.\nFind the deeper, more intrinsic back muscles to do the action of spinal exten-\nsion. Using the latissimus and other superficial back muscles will interfere with \nbreathing and with the ability to find the full range of motion in the scapulae.\nIt is also a challenge to keep the legs adducted and internally rotated in this action. \nAlthough many people seek more extension through external rotation, this involves \nthe risk of overmobilizing the sacroiliac joint or overworking the lumbar spine.\nAs in dhanurasana, the binding of the hands and feet can put pressure into \nvulnerable spots such as the knees and lower back.\nBreathing\nThe excursion of the diaphragm is greatly minimized in dancer’s pose by the combi-\nnation of deep spinal extension and the anterior and posterior musculature working \nagainst each other to stabilize this shape in gravity. Consequently, this pose should \nbe held with quiet breathing, and seldom for a very long time, because the mus-\ncular effort required to maintain it soon outpaces the body’s ability to supply those \nmuscles with oxygen. The longer the pose is held, the deeper the body will need to \nbreathe, and the more the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm will release their \nstabilizing actions, leading to an increased risk to the spine and shoulders.\n54\nVirabhadrasana I\nWarrior I\nveer-ah-bah-DRAHS-anna\nvirabhadra = the name of a fierce mythical warrior\nClassification and Level\nBasic asymmetrical standing backbend\nKey Structures\nArticulate pelvis, integrity of spine, action in legs (rotation to balance the \npelvis).\nGluteus \nmaximus\nSartorius\nQuadriceps\nHamstrings\nPectoralis \nmajor\nRectus \nabdominis\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis\nVastus \nmedialis\nDeltoid\nPectoralis minor\nSerratus anterior\nPsoas major\nSemitendinosus\nGracilis\n55\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension; shoulder flexion, slight abduction of scapulae.

As a result, \nthe contraction of the diaphragm will have more of a tendency to create a brah-\nmana effect by lifting upward the base of the rib cage—an action that will only \noccur efficiently if there is not undue tension in the intercostals, chest, and neck \nmuscles.\nIn short, the challenging leg, pelvis, and arm positions of the warrior poses \ncombine to create interesting challenges to the breath mechanics.\nVariation\nExtended Warrior I\nErector \nspinae\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nGluteus medius \nand minimus\nRectus \nfemoris\nPeroneals\nDeltoid\nRectus \nabdominis\nPsoas major\nQuadriceps\nSartorius\nHamstrings\nAdductors\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis\nExternal \nobliques\nAdductor \nbrevis\nAdductor \nlongus \nGracilis\nVirabhadrasana I  (continued)\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate asymmetrical standing backbend\n57\nJoint Actions\nSame as basic warrior but with deeper \nlumbar extension against anterior \ntilt of pelvis, adduction of legs, more \nsupination in back foot, adduction of \narms, more rotation in spine.\nWorking\nSpinal extensors (intrinsics, transverso-\nspinalis, erector spinae), anterior and \nmiddle deltoids, serratus anterior, \npectoralis major and minor, upper \ntrapezius, rectus abdominis.

The hips and groin \nneed to be quite open, and the legs must be strong for the breathing to be com-\nfortable in this deeply lunged position. If the lower body can’t provide effective \nsupport (sthira) for the upper body, there won’t be enough freedom (sukha) for \neasy breathing.\nLong, narrow stance.\n58\nVirabhadrasana II\nWarrior II\nveer-ah-bah-DRAHS-anna\nvirabhadra = the name of a fierce mythical warrior\nClassification and Level\nBasic asymmetrical standing hip opener\nJoint Actions\nSpine in neutral extension; head rotated on axis; scapula upward rotation; \nupper arm abduction, external rotation; forearm pronation (opposing spi-\nrals in arms). \nFront leg: Nutation; hip flexion, external rotation, abduction; knee flexion; \nankle dorsiflexion. \nBack leg: Counternutation; hip extension, internal rotation, abduction; knee \nextension, external rotation at tibia; ankle dorsiflexion; foot supination at \nheel, pronation at forefoot (arch lifted, big toe grounded).\nBrachial plexus.\nPlexus nerves\nGluteus \nmedius\nTensor \nfascia lata\nRectus femoris\nVastus lateralis\nSubtalar \njoint\nVastus medialis\nLigaments of \nhip joint\nQuadriceps\nSternocleidomastoid\nScalenes\nPectoralis \nminor\n59\nWorking\nBack hip joint: Primarily gluteus medius \nand minimus, for internal rotation \nand abduction; gluteus maximus and \nhamstrings, for extension; tensor \nfascia latae, for internal rotation; pec-\ntineus for internal rotation; vastii, to \nextend knee.\nFront hip joint: Hamstrings and quadri-\nceps (eccentrically), gluteus maximus, \npiriformis, obturator internus and \nexternus, quadratus femoris, gemelli, \ngluteus medius and minimus (poste-\nrior fibers).\nLengthening\nBack hip joint: Tensor fascia lata, iliopsoas.\nFront hip joint: Hamstrings and quadriceps (vastii).\nObstacles and Notes\nBack hip joint: Abduction and extension at the same time is a challenging \nposition for the ligaments and capsule of the hip joint. The work of the \nabductors (gluteus medius and minimus) is important; they help to lift the \nback knee away from the floor. If the gluteus medius and minimus are \nweak or tight, other muscles will be recruited, but they will also bring in \nexternal rotation or flexion at the hip, which will show up as an inability to \n“ground” the back foot.\nBack ankle joint: Articulation is needed in the subtalar joint and the joints \nbetween the tarsals and metatarsals: The back part of the foot supinates \nso the calcaneus can clearly connect to the floor, and the forefoot pronates \nso the toes can clearly connect to the floor. If the foot doesn’t articulate in \nthis way, the outer ankle can be overstretched and weakened.\nFront hip joint: In this position, gravity creates the flexion at the knee and hip; \nthe hamstrings and quadriceps are very active eccentrically to modulate \nthe pull of gravity. As with warrior I, different arrangements of the feet will \naffect the challenges of this pose. The more extended stance creates deeper \nactions at all the joints of the lower extremities, but without sufficient \nmuscular strength in the legs (which can be developed by working in the \n“basic” stance), stress can be placed on the joints and connective tissues.\nBreathing\nSee page 56.\nVirabhadrasana II extended.\nGracilis\nVastus \nlateralis\nVastus medialis \nAdductor \nlongus\nSemitendinosus\nAdductor longus\nQuadriceps\n60\nVirabhadrasana III\nWarrior III\nveer-ah-bah-DRAHS-anna\nvirabhadra = the name of a fierce mythical warrior\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate asymmetrical standing balance\nJoint Actions\nSpine axial extension, shoulder flexion and lateral rotation, elbow extension, \nforearm supination, finger extension.

Both legs’ hamstrings: standing leg eccentrically, back \nleg concentrically against gravity.

If \nabdominal support is lacking, the extensors will overwork, and the spine will arch \nexcessively.\nGravity draws the unsupported side of the pelvis toward the floor. Generally \nyou don’t need to use the adductors to do this; instead, the ability of the abduc-\ntors and external rotators to lengthen with control is essential (otherwise the \npelvis is lifted away from floor).\nIf hamstrings are tight, bending the standing leg is better than rotating the \npelvis.\nBreathing\nThe bandhas (see page 16) create the axial extension that supports the torso in \nthis pose, and by definition, that reduces the overall volume of the breath. Ujjayi \nbreathing is an important ingredient in this process.\n62\nExternal \nobliques\nQuadriceps\nTriceps\nSerratus anterior\nInternal obliques\nGluteus medius\nHamstrings\nUtthita Parsvakonasana\nExtended Side Angle Pose\noo-TEE-tah parsh-vah-cone-AHS-anna\nutthita = extended\nparsva = side, flank\nkona = angle\nClassification and Level\nBasic lateral stretching, asymmetrical standing pose\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral or with slight lateral flexion; shoulder abduction, upward rota-\ntion; glenohumeral joint flexion and external rotation; elbow extension. \nFront leg: nutation; hip flexion, external rotation, abduction; knee flexion; \n63\nankle dorsiflexion. Back leg: counternutation; hip extension, internal rota-\ntion, abduction; knee extension (external rotation at tibia); ankle dorsiflex-\nion; foot supination at heel; pronation at forefoot.\nWorking\nFront leg (compare to virabhadrasana II): With increased hip flexion, the \neccentric action of the hamstrings and vastii become more important—the \nhamstrings because they are resisting the weight of the spine over the \nfront leg and are working at greater length, and the vastii because the \nrectus femoris is shortened and less effective with greater hip flexion.\nUpper side (arm, spine, and back leg): Serratus anterior, deltoids, triceps, \nlower side external obliques, upper side internal obliques. In the back leg, \nthe action is similar to virabhadrasana II: primarily gluteus medius and \nminimus (the anterior fibers help with internal rotation, the posterior fibers \nwith abduction); gluteus maximus, for extension (but not external rota-\ntion); tensor fascia lata, for internal rotation (but not flexion); pectineus for \ninternal rotation (but not flexion); hamstrings (more semimembranosus); \nquadriceps to extend the knee (more vastii than rectus femoris).\nNotes\nIn the front leg, the increased hip flexion makes it more challenging to maintain \nabduction and external rotation in the leg, which keeps the knee from falling \ninward or the hip from swinging out.\nThe increased hip flexion does make it possible for the lower side of the \nbody to stay long and for the spine to maintain its neutral length. If there is not \nenough hip flexion, the spine will flex laterally.\nThe upper arm, spine, and back leg form one continuous diagonal line. It can \nbe a challenge to keep the spine in line with the leg in this position and not to \nflex in the back hip joint.\nBreathing\nEven though the upper side of the breathing mechanism receives a strong \nstretch in this shape, the more interesting effect may be on the lower side of the \nbody, where the dome of the diaphragm is driven cranially by the force of grav-\nity acting on the abdominal organs. Breath action in this position provides very \nuseful asymmetrical stimulation to the diaphragm and all the organs attaching to \nit.\n64\nParivrtta Baddha Parsvakonasana\nRevolved Side Angle Pose\npar-ee-vrt-tah BAH-dah parsh-vah-cone-AHS-anna\nparivrtta = twist, revolve\nbaddha = bound\nparsva = side, flank\nkona = angle\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced rotated asymmetrical standing pose\nJoint Actions\nSpinal axial rotation; scapula downward (medial) rotation; adduction right arm \n(abduction initially, then adduction in left arm as well); glenohumeral joints \ninternal rotation, extension, adduction; elbow extension. Front leg: nuta-\ntion, hip flexion and adduction, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion. Back leg: \nhip extension and adduction, knee extension.\nSplenius \ncapitis\nRhomboids\nHamstrings\nQuadriceps\nErector spinae (under latissimus)\nLatissimus \ndorsi\n65\nThe spinal rotation works the erector spinae and internal obliques on the side of \nthe torso closer to the ceiling and the transversospinalis and rotatores and exter-\nnal obliques on the side of the torso closer to the front leg. All spinal extensors \nare active to counter the spinal flexion created by the action of the arms.\nThe arm binding works the supraspinatus to hold the head of the humerus \nin the socket, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and rhomboids, while \nlengthening the upper trapezius, pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus ante-\nrior, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, anterior deltoid, and coracobra-\nchialis.\nThis arm binding also tends to create spinal flexion, combined with rotation, \nwhich is very challenging to the joints and discs in the spine. The force created \nby revolved side angle makes this a very powerful twist; it is possible to use the \nleverage of the arms in their binding and against the leg to force the spine past \nan appropriate range of motion. Because the lumbar spine is mostly incapable of \naxial rotation, overtwisting will stress the joints above and below: the sacroiliacs \nand T11-T12.\nObstacles and Notes\nThe anterior inferior part of the glenohumeral joint capsule is the most vulnerable \nto dislocation. The binding of the arms in internal rotation and extension puts \npressure on this part of the joint capsule, especially if the scapulae are limited \nin their mobility. This caution applies to binding in general because it allows for \nmore leverage or force to be directed into the joint.\nBreathing\nThis pose is similar to revolved triangle, but more difficult because the strength, \nbalance, and flexibility requirements are higher. The more open the pelvic struc-\ntures are, the easier the balance and breathing will be. Here, the upper body is \nfirmly bound in rotation against the resistance of the lower body, so there is sig-\nnificant resistance to the movements of the diaphragm, abdomen, and rib cage.\n66\nTrikonasana\nTriangle Pose\ntrik-cone-AHS-anna\ntri = three\nkona = angle\nClassification and Level\nBasic hip-opening standing \npose\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral extension, \nslight rotation (but not \nmuch lateral extension); \nhead axial rotation; upper \nlimbs abduction, external \nrotation.

Sensations from within the knee (or any joint) are important signals to stop \nwhat you’re doing and adjust your action or position.\nPain in the lateral knee of the back leg can be from tightness in the muscles \nat the top of the iliotibial band (tensor fascia lata, gluteus medius, gluteus maxi-\nmus); they need to both lengthen and engage. If the gluteus medius and maxi-\nmus are tight and the leg can’t adduct relative to the pelvis, the spine will flex \nlaterally. Tightness at the top of the iliotibial band can also contribute to tightness \nin the back of the ankle.\nDoes the spine rotate? The more articulate the sacroiliac joints, pelvic halves, \nand hip joints are, the more purely the spine can stay neutral. For example, if the \nfront leg has a tight pectineus, the pelvis may rotate to the floor, and the spine \nwill have to counterrotate more to open the chest. Restrictions in any of the \nother lower-body structures that need to articulate will produce similar compen-\nsatory changes farther up in the system.\nVariation\nUtthita Trikonasana\noo-TEE-tah trik-cone-AHS-anna\nExtended Triangle Pose\nutthita = extended\nThe extended version of triangle produces more acute \nangles between the legs and torso and the floor. All the \nsame muscular actions apply, but at a greater range of \nmotion. Even though extended triangle has a lower \ncenter of gravity, it is less stable than regular tri-\nangle, because the more extended this base of \nsupport becomes, the less able the supporting \nmuscles will be to counter the downward pull \nof gravity on the pelvis and torso. If the \npose becomes too extended, significant \nstrain can be transferred to the joints and \nconnective tissue of the weight-bearing \nstructures.\nGracilis\nTensor \nfascia lata\nSemitendinosus\n68\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate twisting asymmetrical standing pose\nLatissimus dorsi\nGluteus \nmaximus\nQuadriceps\nHamstrings\nParivrtta Trikonasana\nRevolved Triangle Pose\npar-ee-vrit-tah trik-cone-AHS-anna\nparivrtta = to turn around, revolve\ntri = three\nkona = angle\n69\nJoint Actions\nSpine: Neutral extension, axial rotation.\nUpper limbs: Abduction, external rotation, elbow extension.\nFront leg: Hip flexion, adduction, external rotation; knee extension; ankle \nslight plantarflexion.\nBack leg: Hip mild flexion, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle dorsiflex-\nion; foot supinated at heel, pronated at forefoot.\nWorking\nTransversospinalis group (especially multifidi), erector spinae group, internal \nand external obliques—to maintain neutral extension in the spine against \nthe pull of gravity and the muscular efforts of the leg and pelvis.\nUsing Rotators and Abductors for Balance\nWorking while lengthening: Gluteus medius and minimus, quadratus femoris, \nobturator internus and externus, gemelli, piriformis.\nLengthening and releasing: Gluteus maximus, hamstrings, latissimus dorsi, \nteres major.\nObstacles and Notes\nWeakness in the abductors and rotators will make eccentric control difficult. If \nthis is the case, the gluteus maximus might be recruited, which will cause the \npelvis to tilt posteriorly. The lower spine will then not be in neutral, and the rota-\ntion of the spine will not be around the head–tail axis.\nBreathing\nIn revolved triangle, the more open the pelvic structures are, the easier the bal-\nance and breathing will be. Otherwise, the upper body will be held stiffly in rota-\ntion against the resistance of the lower body, and the diaphragm, abdomen, and \nrib cage will encounter considerable resistance to their movements.\n70\nParsvottanasana\nIntense Side Stretch\nparsh-voh-tahn-AHS-anna\nparsva = side, flank\nut = intense\ntan = to stretch\nClassification and Level\nBasic asymmetrical forward-bending standing pose\nJoint Actions\nSpine flexion (mild); nutation in front leg; counternutation in back leg.

The back foot also moves toward supination, to \ncounter the inner rolling of the arch of the foot.\nBreathing\nThe action of exhaling from the lower abdomen helps to position the pelvis on \nthe thighs, and the action of inhaling into the thoracic region helps to lengthen \nthe spine.\n(continued)\n72\nParsvottanasana Variation\nWith Arms in Reverse Namaskar\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate asymmetrical forward-bending standing pose\nJoint Actions\nDownward rotation, adduction of scapulae on rib cage; extension and medial \nrotation at glenohumeral joint; elbow flexion; forearm pronation; wrist \ndorsiflexion; hand extension.\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nSubscapularis\nTrapezius\nSerratus \nanterior\nInfraspinatus\nDeltoid\nParsvottanasana  (continued)\n73\nKey Structures\nScapulae articulating on rib cage, forearm and wrist mobility.\nWorking\nSubscapularis; teres major; latissimus dorsi; rhomboids; lower, mid-, and upper \ntrapezius.\nLengthening\nInfraspinatus; teres minor; serratus anterior; anterior deltoids; pectoralis major \nand minor, if scapulae are adducted.\nObstacles\nOveruse of the latissimus dorsi will interfere with the ability of the spine to \nflex.\nTight pectorals, tight deltoids, tight shoulder joint capsule.\nNotes\nThis arm position is most easily done with the scapulae abducted.

If legs are medially rotated, may \nget some stretch through quadratus femoris, obturator externus.\nAs the legs separate (abduct), different hamstrings are affected more or less \nstrongly as well as different adductors. Because some of the adductors also act \nas hip flexors, they aren’t stretched in this position. The standing preparation for \nthis pose (standing upright with the hips in neutral extension) would be more of \na stretch for the pectineus and some fibers of the adductor brevis and gracilis.\nBreathing\nWide-stance forward bend is probably the safest, most accessible inversion in \nall of yoga practice. The more firmly the legs can create support, while at the \nsame time allowing the pelvis to freely rotate forward at the hip joints, the more \nrelaxed the torso and breathing will be. This inversion provides mild traction and \nrelease to the spine, while reversing the usual action of the breath.\nHanging upside down, the diaphragm is pulled cranially by gravity, thus favor-\ning the exhalation and the venous return from the lower body. While inhaling, \nthe diaphragm pushes the weight of the abdominal organs caudally, against \ngravity, while at the same time mobilizing the costovertebral joints in the thoracic \nspine, which is being tractioned open. All these altered muscular actions can help \nnormalize circulation in both muscles and organs that are constantly subjected to \nthe usual stresses of upright weight bearing.\nExtrinsic muscles of arch support—\nmedial ankle.\nTibialis anterior\nFlexor digitorum \nlongus\nFlexor hallucis \nlongus\n76\nUpavesasana\nSquat—Sitting-Down Pose\noo-pah-ve-SHAHS-anna\nupavesa = sitting down, seat\nNote: This pose is almost never \nreferred to by a Sanskrit name, \nbut there is some precedent for \nthe name given here.\nClassification and Level\nBasic symmetrical standing \npose\nJoint Actions\nSpinal axial extension; gle-\nnohumeral joint external \nrotation, adduction; elbow \nflexion; forearm pronation; \nwrist dorsiflexion; sacrum \nnutation; hip flexion, exter-\nnal rotation, abduction; \nknee flexion; ankle dorsi-\nflexion.\nNote continuity of anterior longitudinal ligament with \ncrura and coccyx.\nThe pelvic floor can be con-\ntacted easily in this position, \nwhere it works synergisti-\ncally to initiate exhaling, \nand releases some tone in \nresponse to the downward \npressure exerted by the \nthoracic diaphragm when \ninhaling.\nAdductor \nhallucis \nFlexor \nhallucis \nbrevis\nThoracic diaphragm\nCrura\nAbductor \ndigiti minimi\nQuadratus \nplantae\nLevator \nani\nCoccyx\nPelvic \nfloor\nObturator \ninternus\nQuadratus \nfemoris\nLumbricals\n77\nWorking\nPelvic floor: Obturator internus, levator ani.

A quick fix is \navailable by using support under the heels, but it’s important not to become too \nreliant on it, because it will prevent activation of the intrinsic muscles of the feet, \nwhich stabilizes the arches, allows deeper flexion in the ankle, and aligns the \nbones of the foot and knee joint. Look for the tendon of the anterior tibialis pop-\nping forward; this is a telltale sign that deep support is lacking. Let gravity create \nthe flexion, and use the intrinsic muscles to maintain integrity.\nBreathing\nThis pose offers an opportunity to powerfully lengthen all three curves of the \nspine (axial extension). By definition this usually engages all three bandhas, and \nin this position, the deep support in the arches of the feet energetically feeds into \nthe lifting action of the pelvic floor and lower abdominal muscles (mula bandha). \nThe bracing of the elbows against the knees allows for a strong lengthening \nof the thoracic spine and lifting of the base of the rib cage and respiratory dia-\nphragm (uddiyana bandha). The chin-lock of jalandhara bandha completes the \naction of axial extension and essentially freezes out the normal respiratory shape \nchanges of breathing. This is when the unusual pattern of breath associated with \nmahamudra can arise deep in the core of the system (susumna).\n79\nsitting poses\n79\n5\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\nF\nor many people in the industrialized world, sitting (or more likely, slouching) on a piece of \nfurniture is the body position in which they spend most of their waking hours. What shoes \nare to the feet, chairs, car seats, and couches are to the pelvic joints and lower spine.\nIn India, even well-to-do families frequently eschew the use of furniture in their homes—\npreferring to sit, dine, and sometimes even sleep on the floor. Not surprisingly, the Western \nepidemic of lower-back pain is almost unknown in that part of the world.\nIn yoga practice, just as the bare feet develop a new relationship with the ground through \nthe practice of standing asanas, the hip, pelvic joints, and lower spine develop a new rela-\ntionship with the earth when you bear weight directly on them in sitting postures.\nThe asanas depicted in this chapter are either sitting positions themselves or are entered \ninto from sitting. If practiced with attention to the anatomy of the relevant joints, muscles, \nand connective tissue, they can help to restore some of the natural flexibility you knew as \na child, when sitting and playing on the floor for hours at a time was effortless.\nBeyond the idea of restoring natural function to the pelvis and lower back, yogic sitting \nalso has an association with more advanced practices. The word asana in fact can be literally \ntranslated as “seat,” and from a certain perspective, all of asana practice can be viewed as \na methodical way of freeing up the spine, limbs, and breathing so that the yogi can spend \nextended periods of time in a seated position. In this most stable of body shapes, the dis-\ntractions of dealing with gravity and breath can disappear, freeing the body’s energies for \nthe deeper contemplative work of meditative practices.\nSukhasana\nEasy Posture\nsuk-HAS-anna\nsukha = comfortable, \ngentle, agreeable\nBeginning seated pose\nSiddhasana\nAdept’s Posture\nsid-DHAS-anna\nsiddha = accomplished, \nfulfilled, perfected\nBasic seated pose\nBlue shaded areas indicate places of contact with the floor.\n80\t\nYoga Anatomy\nSvastikasana\nAuspicious Posture\nsva-steek-AHS-anna\nsvastik = lucky or auspi-\ncious\nIntermediate seated pose\nPadmasana\nLotus Posture\npod-MAHS-anna\npadma = lotus\nAdvanced seated pose\nMulabandhasana\nPose of the Root Lock\nmoola-ban-DHAS-anna\nmula = root, foundation, \nbottom\nbandha = binding, tying, \na bond\nVery advanced seated \naxial extension\nPose used for pranayama\nKey structures for all seated poses\nFeet, ankles, knees, hip joints, pelvis, spine, and skull.\nCommon joint actions\nKnees flexed\nHip joints flexed\nSpine in neutral curves or axial extension\nSkull balanced on spine\nCommon elements to all sitting\nWhatever sitting position one chooses, if the knees are above the hip joints, the pelvis can \ntip posteriorly, causing the spinal curves to go into flexion, especially if there is tightness in \n\t\nsitting poses\t\n81\nthe hamstrings. To maintain an upright shape, the erector muscles contract to extend the \nspine, and the psoas muscles contract to pull the anterior lumbar spine forward (attempt-\ning to restore the lumbar curve). Unfortunately, this psoas action tends to also pull the hips \ninto greater flexion, reinforcing the posterior tilt of the pelvis, which calls a host of other \nmuscles into play in attempt to compensate. A person engaged in such a losing battle with \ngravity will have little energy available for breathing or meditation practices, and will soon \ntire of sitting.\nIn order for a seated asana to be maintained in a comfortable manner for any length of \ntime, for most people, the hip joints need to be at least slightly elevated above the knees. \nFor the vast majority of people, this requires the use of a cushion, folded blanket, or other \naid.1 With the hips elevated above the knees, the lumbar and other spinal curves are restored, \nand the weight of the head can balance with minimal muscular effort. In a well-supported \nseated asana, the intrinsic equilibrium of the pelvis, spine, and breathing mechanism sup-\nport the body, and the energy that has been liberated from postural effort can be focused \non deeper processes, such as breathing or meditation.\n1 The less flexible the individual, the higher the support must be. For some, no amount of support will create a comfortable seat \non the floor; that is an indication that a chair should be used for seated practices.\nSitting with the knees above the hips causes quick \nfatigue because the muscles must work against gravity.\nSitting with the hips above the knees \nrestores equilibrium and allows for \nlonger comfort.\nErector \nspinae\nPsoas\nPelvis tips \nposteriorly\nHips pulled into \ngreater flexion\nSpinal \ncurves \nrestored\n82\nPaschimottanasana\nWest (Back) Stretching\nPOS-chee-moh-tan-AHS-anna\npascha = behind, after, later, westward\nuttana = intense stretch\nThe back of the body is referred to as “west” due to the traditional practice of \nfacing the rising sun when performing morning worship.

Instead, a folded blanket under the sitting bones can elevate the \nseat so that gravity is drawing the upper body forward more effectively. This is \npreferable to using the hip flexors and abdominal muscles, which can create a \nsense of congestion in the hip joints.\nElevating the seat, bending the knees, or both, can allow the spine to come \nmore forward. There will still be lengthening in the hamstrings, but in a less \nstressful way.\nIt should be noted that any stretching sensations around the origin or insertion \nof a muscle indicate that the tendons and connective tissue are being stretched—\nas opposed to the muscle fibers. Alignment and intention should always be \nadapted to direct stretching sensations into the belly of the target muscle—not its \nattachments.\nBreathing\nThe breath can be very helpful while moving into this pose. Emphasizing the \naction of the exhalation deepens the flexion at the pelvis, whereas emphasizing \nthe action of the inhalation assists in extending the upper spine. This will only \noccur if the exhalation is initiated with the lower abdominal muscles and the \ninhalation is directed toward the rib cage.\nThe back line of the body is a continuous network of muscle and fascia that extends from the soles \nof the feet (plantar fascia) to the scalp fascia and the ridge of the brow.\nPlantar \nfascia\nScalp \nfascia\nErector \nspinae\nSacrotuberous \nligament\nHamstrings\nGastrocnemius\nSoleus\nAchilles \ntendon\n84\nJanu Sirsasana\nHead-to-Knee Pose\nJAH-new shear-SHAHS-anna\njanu = knee\nshiras = to touch with the head\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate seated forward bend\nThe entire back line of the extended leg side can be length-\nened—from the sole of the foot to the scalp fascia.\nSpinal extensors\nLatissimus dorsi\nGastrocnemius\nHamstrings\n85\nJoint Actions\nMild spinal flexion (moving toward extension) and mild rotation; sacrum is in \nnutation.

The latis-\nsimus dorsi lengthen bilaterally. Extended-leg-side external obliques and \nfolded-leg-side internal obliques, extended-leg-side rotatores, and multifidi \nlengthen with the rotation toward the straight leg (these are the reverse of \nthe working actions mentioned earlier).\nExtended leg: Hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus and \ngemelli, some gluteus medius and minimus, gastrocnemius, and soleus. \nThe popliteus can create slight knee flexion to prevent hyperextension.\nFolded leg: The adductor magnus mainly stretches because it creates internal \nrotation, extension, and adduction (as in baddha konasana). The adduc-\ntor longus and brevis also stretch because they flex and externally rotate \nthe leg (abduction lengthens these two). The more the legs are externally \nrotated and abducted, the more the pectineus is lengthened. There also \nmight be some lengthening in the tensor fascia lata, because of the exter-\nnal rotation, and in the fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus with \nincreasing hip flexion.\nArms: The rhomboids lengthen, as do the lower trapezius and latissimus dorsi.\nObstacles and Notes\nThe asymmetry of this pose makes it very revealing about the “sidedness” exhib-\nited in the back muscles. Janu sirsasana can also reveal sidedness in the relative \nstability or mobility of the sacroiliac joints. Everyone has an “easy” and a “hard” \nside in this pose because of the inherent asymmetries of the human body.\nThe more mobile the sacroiliac joint is on the side of the flexed leg, the easier \nit is to turn and face the extended leg. This is especially true as the spine extends \ntoward the extended leg. As hip flexion deepens, less spinal flexion is required. \nBecause this limits even further the rotation in the lumbar spine, more movement \nneeds to happen at the sacroiliac joint.\nIt is very common to overmobilize the sacroiliac joint in janu sirsasana. This \nhappens when the pose is pushed or flexed too forcibly or held for too long \nwithout relieving the weight on the pelvis. Alternatively, immobility of the pelvic \njoints can lead to excessive torque in the bent-leg knee joint. Many yogis report \nmeniscus tears occurring as they move into this pose. This happens in a partially \nflexed knee as the pelvis flexes forward, taking the femur with it, which grinds \nthe medial femoral condyle into the medial meniscus. Ensuring that the bent leg \nis truly fully flexed will move the meniscus safely to the back of the joint.\nAll this points to the fact that the potential stresses to the spine, sacroiliac, and \nhip and knee joints need to be evenly distributed so that no one structure takes \nall the force of this pose.\nJanu Sirsasana  (continued)\n87\nBreathing\nThe breath can be very helpful while moving into this pose. Emphasizing the \naction of the exhalation deepens the flexion at the pelvis, whereas emphasizing \nthe action of the inhalation assists in extending the upper spine. This will only \noccur if the exhalation is initiated with the lower abdominal muscles and the \ninhalation is directed toward the rib cage.\nIt’s interesting to experiment with the opposite pattern of breath, just to create \na contrast: Try exhaling by compressing the chest and inhaling into the belly \nregion. Notice the effect on the asana compared with the first suggestions.\n88\nParivrtta Janu Sirsasana\nRevolved Head-to-Knee Pose\npar-ee-vrit-tah JAH-new shear-SHAHS-anna\nparivrtta = turning, rolling\njanu = knee\nshiras = to touch with the head\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate seated lateral twist\nJoint Actions\nSpinal rotation and lateral flexion.

There also might be some lengthening in the \ntensor fascia lata with the external rotation and in the fibers of the gluteus \nmedius and minimus with more flexion.\nArms: Rhomboids, lower trapezius, latissimus dorsi.\nObstacles and Notes\nAlthough the legs in this pose are the same as in janu sirsasana, the action in the \nspine is very different: Instead of rotating toward the extended leg, the rotation \nis away from the leg, and instead of flexion in the spine there is lateral flexion. \nThis change in spinal action changes the action in the shoulder girdle and arms as \nwell—notably, more lengthening occurs in the latissimus dorsi.\nSide-bending poses are great for releasing restrictions in the shoulder joints. \nWhen flexion of the glenohumeral joint is restricted, greater mobility can often \nbe found by mobilizing the scapula in lateral flexion.\nIn this pose, the opposite sitting bone must stay on the ground to keep the \npose’s action balanced. When side bending over the extended leg, the hip of the \nfolded leg can come off the floor, which diminishes the lengthening in the back \nof the body, but increases the lengthening in the back of the extended leg.\nBreathing\nThe upper side of this pose is receiving more stretch, and the rib cage is more \nopen, but the lower dome of the diaphragm is more mobile, and the lower lung’s \ntissue is more compliant. Focusing on this fact can quite naturally create a bit \nmore awareness of the lower side, which helps prevent compressive collapse.\n90\nUpavistha Konasana\nSeated Wide-Angle Pose\noo-pah-VEESH-tah cone-AHS-anna\nupavistha = seated\nkona = angle\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate seated forward bend\nJoint Actions\nMild spinal flexion (moving toward axial extension); sacrum nutation; major \nhip abduction, external rotation, and flexion; knee extension; ankle dorsi-\nflexion.\nWorking\nLegs: The gemelli and obturator internus are doing both external rotation and \nabduction. To a lesser degree, the piriformis and gluteus maximus can help \nwith external rotation (but are also hip extensors); additionally, the obtura-\ntor externus and quadratus femoris can help with external rotation (but are \nalso adductors). The posterior fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus \nhelp somewhat with abduction, but are working at a pretty short length, \nso they may cramp.\nPiriformis\nSuperior \ngemellus\nObturator \ninternus\nInferior \ngemellus\nBiceps \nfemoris\nSoleus\nGastrocnemius\nSemimembranosus\nGracilis\nSemitendinosus\n91\nSpine: Spinal extensors are active here so that as the pose deepens and the \nhead comes forward to reach the floor, the spine flattens out along the \nfloor. If too much emphasis is put on flexing the spine to get the head \ndown, the legs are not adequately accessed.\nLengthening\nLegs: Piriformis and gluteus maximus are working eccentrically because they \nare extensors of the hip; obturator externus and quadratus femoris are \nworking eccentrically because they are also adductors. Of the adductors, \nthe gracilis is especially stretched because of the \nknee extension; the pectineus is not \naffected because of the hip flexion. \nIn the hamstrings, the semi-\ntendinosus and semimem-\nbranosus are particularly \nlengthened here because of \nthe abduction of the legs. \nWhen the hands reach \nto the foot to assist the \nankle into dorsiflexion, the \ngastrocnemius receives a \nstrong stretch.\nSpine: Extensors of the spine \nare lengthening, but active. \nAs the pose deepens, it \nmoves toward more axial \nextension.\nObstacles and Notes\nThere is a strong action of nutation at the sacroiliac joint, as the top of the \nsacrum “nods” forward, while leaving the iliac bones behind.\nIf the legs roll inward, there can be too much stretch for the inner knee and \nadductors. For tight students, it’s preferable to bend the knees a bit (with sup-\nport) so that the stretching sensations are felt more in the bellies of the relevant \nmuscles. Sensations of stretch occurring near the joints and muscle attachments \nare indicators that nothing useful is likely to result from the stretch.\nBreathing\nThe act of gradually lengthening the spine in this pose can be greatly assisted by \nthe breath. The exhalation, if initiated in the lower abdomen, can help anchor \nthe sitting bones and ground the backs of the thighs, whereas the inhalation, \nif it’s initiated in the upper chest, can help to lengthen the spine. In short, the \nexhalation can ground the posture’s lower half, and the inhalation can lengthen \nthe posture’s upper half.\nGracilis\nPiriformis\nGemellus\nObturator \ninternus\n92\nBaddha Konasana\nBound Angle Pose\nBAH-dah cone-AHS-anna\nbaddha = bound\nkona = angle\nClassification and Level\nBasic seated hip/groin stretch\nGracilis\nAdductor magnus\n93\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral extension when upright, moving to mild flexion when bend-\ning forward (but not too much flexion, which will reduce the action in the \npelvis); sacroiliac joint nutation; hip flexion and external rotation; knee \nflexion; ankle dorsiflexion; foot supination; scapula neutral on rib cage; \nglenohumeral joint external rotation, anatomically neutral; elbow flexion; \nforearm supination; hand and finger flexion.\nWorking\nSpine: Intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, transversospinalis group, erec-\ntor spinae group to maintain neutral extension of spine, then gravity to \nbring the spine forward and into mild flexion.\nLegs: Gravity nutates the sacrum and flexes the hips; the obturator externus, \nquadratus femoris, piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli act to exter-\nnally rotate the hip joint; the hamstrings work to flex the knees; the tibialis \nanterior supinates the foot. The sartorius should be considered active as \nwell, to flex and externally rotate the hip joint.\nArms: A balance between the serratus anterior and rhomboids is needed to \nhold the scapulae on the rib cage. The biceps flex the elbows and draw the \nbody forward, as the flexors of the carpals and fingers work to grasp the \nfeet.\nLengthening\nLegs: A major stretch is given to the adductor magnus mainly because it cre-\nates internal rotation, extension, and adduction, opposite to the actions of \nbaddha konasana. There is also some stretch to the adductor longus and \nbrevis, and gracilis. The more the knees are extended, the more the gracilis \nis lengthened. Because the adductor longus and brevis work to flex and \nexternally rotate the leg, it’s the abduction in the pose that lengthens these \ntwo of the adductor group.\nThere also might be some lengthening in the tensor fascia latae, as a result of \nexternal rotation, and in the fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus with \nincreased hip flexion. The hamstrings will also lengthen with increased hip \nflexion, increasing as the feet move away and the knees extend more.\nObstacles and Notes\nMuch as in paschimottanasana, if the focus is too much on getting the head \ndown, the resulting action is more spinal (flexion) than pelvic (sacroiliac and hip \njoints). For this reason, the intention should not be to get the head to the feet, \nbut to get the navel to the feet.\n(continued)\n94\nThe activity of the obturator internus in this pose also activates the muscles of \nthe pelvic floor. This is an opportunity to engage mula bandha, which anchors \nthe base of the pose.\nDepending on how close the feet are to the groin, different external rotators \nwill be activated to assist with rotating the legs out and different adductors will \nbe lengthened. Thus, it’s quite valuable to work with the feet at different dis-\ntances from the pelvis. Closer isn’t always better.\nBaddha konasana can be challenging for the knees. The supination of the feet \n(soles toward the ceiling) causes a rotation of the tibia that, combined with flex-\nion, destabilizes the ligamentous support for the knees. If the hips are not very \nmobile and the legs are pushed into this pose, the lower leg torque can travel \ninto the knee joints. One way to protect them is to evert the foot (press the outer \nedges into the floor). This activates the peroneals, which, via fascial connections, \ncan stabilize the lateral ligaments of the knees and help to keep them from rotat-\ning too much. The result of this will be to direct more of the pose’s action into \nthe hip joints.\nBreathing\nThe advice to bring the navel—rather than the head—to the feet is another way \nof saying that the breath should remain as unobstructed as possible in this pose. \nPushing the head toward the floor will collapse the rib cage and compress the \nabdomen, resulting in a reduced ability for those cavities to change shape. A \nlengthened spine results in freer breathing.\nVariation\nSupta Baddha Konasana\nReclining Bound Angle Pose\nsupta = resting, lain down to sleep\nBaddha Konasana  (continued)\n95\nThis restful variation of baddha konasana puts the spine in neutral alignment or \nvery mild extension to gently open up the breathing.

Bottom: piriformis because of hip adduction and \nflexion; gluteus medius and minimus because of hip adduction and flexion.\nArms: Front: rhomboids may be working eccentrically and lengthening; latis-\nsimus dorsi may be lengthening because of external shoulder rotation and \nrotation of the spine. Back: pectoralis major, long head of biceps, pectoralis \nminor, coracobrachialis.\nObstacles and Notes\nAll parts of the torso can contribute to this twist—both right and left sides of the \nfront and both right and left sides of the back, at different layers of muscle. The \nspine will have the most balanced rotation when in neutral extension. Flexion in \nthe lumbar spine will jeopardize the stability of the lumbar vertebrae and discs, \nand too much extension will tend to lock the thoracic spine into place, inhibiting \naxial rotation there.\nThe twisting action of this pose can be “faked” by overmobilizing the scapulae \nand allowing them to adduct (the back one) and abduct (the front one) exces-\nsively. When this happens there is the appearance of rotation, but not much \nactual movement in the spine. Because the shoulder girdle has more range of \nmotion in this direction than the thoracic structures have, it is frequently a more \nintense spinal twist when the arms are placed in a simple, nonbound position. \nIt is therefore preferable to enter this pose without using the arms, so the maxi-\nmum safe action is found in the spine. The leverage of the arms comes in last, as \na deepening, stabilizing (not mobilizing) action. Overuse of the arms can direct \ntoo much force into vulnerable parts of the spine—particularly T11-T12.\nAnother factor that contributes to the intensity of the spinal twisting action \nof this pose is the arrangement of the legs, which greatly limits rotational move-\nments in the pelvis—and in fact counterrotates the pelvis away from the rotation \nof the spine.\nBreathing\nArdha matsyendrasana provides a very clear opportunity to explore the basic \ndynamics of the breath as they relate to the principles of brahmana/langhana, \nprana/apana, and sthira/sukha.\nArdha Matsyendrasana  (continued)\n99\nThe lower body is the stable base of the pose, and a langhana “belly breath-\ning” pattern can release tension in the lower abdomen, hip joints, and pelvic \nfloor. This approach to breathing stimulates the experience of apana flowing \ndownward in the system, into the earth.\nThe upper body is the mobile, supported aspect of the pose, and the brah-\nmana “chest breath” can be accomplished here simply by stabilizing the abdomi-\nnal wall upon the initiation of the inhalation. This will drive the diaphragm’s \naction into the rib cage and costovertebral articulations and greatly intensify deep \nrotational release in the thoracic spine. This breathing pattern is clearly related to \nthe upward movement of apana, using the lower abdominal muscles to assist in \ndriving the exhalation upward and outward from the body.\nIn this pose, use a simple nonbound arm position and try doing several rounds \nof relaxed belly breathing to begin with. Then, gradually deepen the lower \nabdominal contractions on the exhalation, eventually maintaining that contrac-\ntion for a moment when initiating the next inhalation. Notice the effect of the \nbreathing patterns on your experience of the pose.\n100\nDandasana\nStaff Pose\ndan-DAHS-anna\ndanda = stick, staff\nClassification and Level\nBasic seated neutral extension\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral or axial extension; sacroiliac is neutral; hip flexion to 90 degrees, \nadduction and internal rotation; knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula \nneutral on rib cage; glenohumeral neutral extension; elbow extension; \nwrist dorsiflexion (depending on arm length).\nArm and torso proportions: short, neutral, and long.\nSpinal \nextensors\nGastrocnemius\nHamstrings\n101\nWorking\nSpine: All spinal extensors, the psoas major and minor.\nLegs: The iliacus to flex the hips, the pectineus and adductor magnus to adduct \nand internally rotate the legs. The vastii extend the knees. (If this amount of \nflexion is challenging, the pectineus or rectus femoris might overwork to pull \nthe pelvis into flexion against the backward pull of gravity.)\nArms: The serratus anterior resists the adduction of the scapulae resulting \nfrom the push of the arms; the triceps extend the elbows. The flexor carpi \nradialis and ulnaris, and the lumbricals of the hands, support the arch of \nthe hand and prevent overflexing of the wrist (short-armed people would \nneed a block under each hand to create this action).\nLengthening\nLegs: The hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus, and \ngemelli all lengthen. Additionally, there will be some lengthening in the \ngluteus medius and minimus, as well as the gastrocnemius and soleus. \nWorking at length (eccentrically) is the popliteus.\nArms: Depending on arm length, the biceps may be lengthening.\nObstacles and Notes\nThis pose clearly reveals how tightness in the legs can create spinal flexion. \nObstacles that show up clearly in this pose are often the cause of difficulties in \nmore complex poses, where the restrictions are less obvious. For example, tight-\nness in the legs will affect downward-facing dog, but in a way that can appear to \nbe more about shoulder or spinal restriction.\nNot everyone can use their arms to help create the neutral spinal extension in \ndandasana due to proportional differences in arm-to-body length. Conversely, \nwhat appears to be different arm-to-body proportions can sometimes be the \nresult of chronically elevated or depressed positioning of the scapulae on the rib \ncage. Additionally, if the spine is unable to extend into vertical because of tight-\nness in the hips and legs, the arms may seem too long.\nFor students of vinyasa flows that involve jump-throughs, knowing your arm-\nto-torso proportions is absolutely essential. An inability to jump-through due \nto a long torso and short arms will not respond to any amount of stretching or \nstrengthening. Use blocks under the hands to level the playing field.\nBreathing\nThis is a straight-legged opportunity to breathe into an axially extended spine \n(mahamudra). Unlike pada hastasana, in which the legs are working to support the \nweight of the body, the legs are not “naturally” activated in dandasana. For this \nreason, the work in the legs is quite different, and for most people, more difficult \nto maintain. All three bandhas can be employed here, but it’s quite a challenge to \ndo even 10 breaths while maintaining them with the proper body alignment.\n102\nGomukhasana\nCow-Faced Pose\ngo-moo-KAHS-anna\ngo = cow\nmukha = face\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate hip and shoulder opener\nJoint Actions\nMostly neutral spine, with slight extension in the thoracic spine because of the \narm position. Top arm: scapula upward rotation, elevation, adduction; gle-\nnohumeral joint external rotation and flexion; elbow flexion; forearm pro-\nnation. Bottom arm: scapula downward rotation, adduction, depression; \nglenohumeral joint internal rotation, extension; elbow flexion; forearm \nsupination. Legs: hip flexion, external rotation, adduction; knee flexion; \nankle plantarflexion.\nTriceps\nSubscapularis\nLong head \nof triceps\n103\nWorking\nLegs: Because this is a hip \nopener, the leg and hip \nmuscles are released into \ngravity as much as possible.\nArms: Top arm: infraspinatus \nand teres minor for external \nrotation, serratus anterior \nto upwardly rotate scapula, \nthen rhomboids to adduct, \nanterior deltoid to flex arm, \npronator teres, finger flex-\nors. Bottom arm: subscapu-\nlaris to internally rotate, \nteres major and latissimus \ndorsi for internal rotation \nand extension, long head \nof triceps and posterior del-\ntoids to extend arm, biceps \nto flex elbow, supinators in \nforearm, finger flexors.\nLengthening\nLegs: Abductors (gluteus medius, minimus, maximus) and extensors (adductor \nmagnus and hamstrings); piriformis because of flexion and adduction of legs.\nArms: Top arm: triceps, latissimus dorsi, teres major, pectoralis minor and pec-\ntoralis major. Bottom arm: long head of biceps, pectoralis major, serratus \nanterior, upper trapezius.\nObstacles and Notes\nUpward and downward rotation of the scapula needs to precede adduction to \navoid overmobilizing in the shoulder joint. If the scapulae don’t mobilize, there \ncan be too much movement in the glenohumeral joint causing overstretching in \nthe joint capsule or impingements in the tendons of the biceps and supraspinatus. \nIf the hips joints are not sufficiently mobile, excessive torque can result in the \nknee joints. Great care should be taken to avoid any strain in the knees, because \nthe menisci are most vulnerable when the knee joints are semiflexed.\nBreathing\nReleasing the abdominal wall and directing the breath into the lower abdomen \nhelps the pelvic floor and hip joints to release. Restraining the lower abdomen \nduring an inhalation directs the breath into the thoracic region, which intensifies \nthe stretching in the shoulder structures.\nTeres \nminor\nRhomboids\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nSubscapularis\nPosterior \ndeltoid\nLong head \nof triceps\n104\nHanumanasana\nMonkey Pose\nha-new-mahn-AHS-anna\nhanumat = having large jaws: a monkey-chief\nHanuman was the semidivine chief of an army of monkeys who served the god \nRama. As told in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, Hanuman once jumped in a \nsingle stride the distance between Southern India and (Sri) Lanka. This split-leg \npose mimics his famous leap.\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced seated split\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension. Front leg: sacrum nutation; hip flexion, internal rotation, \nadduction; knee extension; ankle neutral extension. Back leg: sacrum \ncounternutation; hip extension, internal rotation, adduction; knee exten-\nsion; ankle plantarflexion; scapula upward rotation, abduction, elevation; \nglenohumeral joint flexion, adduction, external rotation; elbow extension; \nforearm neutral.\nPsoas major\nRectus femoris\nQuadriceps\nHamstrings\n105\nWorking\nArms: Serratus anterior to wrap scapula; anterior deltoid to flex arm; infraspi-\nnatus and teres minor to externally rotate at the glenohumeral joint; biceps \nlong head to flex the arm; triceps to extend the elbow; coracobrachialis \nand pectoralis major to flex and adduct the arm.\nGravity moves the weight of the body deeper into the position, but to do \nthe pose safely, the body is not just passively releasing into gravity. Thus, \nmost of the muscles listed as lengthening are also in some way working at \nlength (eccentrically) to stabilize the pose. In addition, some muscles are \nworking concentrically.\nSpine: Concentrically: extensors of the spine. Eccentrically: all the muscles \nlisted as lengthening.\nLegs: Front leg: hamstrings, gluteus maximus, gastrocnemius, and soleus, \neccentrically; articularis genus, maybe quadriceps, concentrically. Back leg: \npsoas major, iliacus, rectus femoris, sartorius, and tensor fascia lata, eccen-\ntrically.\nTensor fascia lata\nAdductor longus\nGracilis\nGluteus maximus\nHamstrings\nGastrocnemius\nSartorius\nRectus femoris\nPectineus\nHanumanasana viewed from underneath.\n(continued)\n106\nLengthening\nSpine: Obliques, psoas minor, rectus abdominis, intercostals in front of the \nrib cage, anterior longus colli and verticalis, suprahyoid and infrahyoid \nmuscles.\nLegs: Front leg: hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus \nand gemelli, posterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus, gastrocne-\nmius, and soleus (perhaps other rotators such as quadratus femoris and \nobturator externus). Back leg: psoas major, iliacus, rectus femoris, sartorius, \ntensor fascia lata, pectineus, adductor longus and brevis, gracilis (the more \ninternally rotated the back leg, the less vulnerable the adductors are to \nbeing strained, as in a “pulled groin muscle”).\nObstacles and Notes\nIn this difficult pose, the forward-bending action in the front leg/pelvic half \ncombines with the backward-bending action in the back leg/pelvic half to create \nthe challenge of keeping the spine balanced between those two contradictory \nactions.\nBecause of the opposing action of the legs and pelvic halves, the forward-\nbending aspect of this pose is more difficult than a forward bend done with both \nlegs, and vice versa. This is due to the opposition action of the other leg, which \nprevents the spine from doing the flexing or extending. Thus, all the movement \nin the lower half of the body must come from the sacroiliac joint, hip, and leg.\nBecause there is generally more hip range of motion in flexion than in exten-\nsion, the movement of the back leg draws the spine into extension. This is also \nwhy more work is often felt in the extensors of the front leg than in the flexors \nof the back leg.\nIn a way, this is a bound pose because of the way the action in each leg is lim-\nited by the opposite leg. It is therefore possible to overmobilize vulnerable areas \n(hamstring attachments are especially at risk in this pose). This concern is greatly \ncompounded if the pose is done passively.\nIf hanumanasana is done more actively, with attention to the eccentric action \nof the lengthening muscles, the “stretch” of the pose can be distributed over \nseveral joints—stabilizing the mobile ones and mobilizing the fixated areas. Neu-\nromuscularly, this eccentric activity also stimulates the muscles’ spindle portion \nof the stretch reflex to release the muscles into greater length. Active use of the \nantagonistic muscles (for example, contracting the quadriceps) can also activate \nthe “reciprocal innervation” stretch reflex, which stimulates the hamstrings to \nrelease further.\nIn this pose, many people allow the back leg to externally rotate to get it “all \nthe way down.” Letting the back leg roll out puts twisting pressure into the \nlumbar spine and/or the sacroiliac joint of the back leg—not to mention a twist-\ning pressure into the back knee. It also puts more pressure into the adductors of \nHanumanasana  (continued)\n107\nthe back leg (longus, brevis, pectineus, and gracilis) without the eccentric support \nof the iliacus and psoas major or rectus femoris. As a result, the groin gets over-\nstretched, and the usually overtight rectus femoris doesn’t get as much stretch as \nit could. It’s much more rigorous to do this correctly, and much safer for the legs \nand pelvis.\nBreathing\nYou’ll know you’re doing this pose effectively when you can breathe freely. Until \nall the flexion, extension, and rotational forces have been neutralized, and the \nspine can extend easily, the breathing will tend to be labored and rough. The use \nof props such as blocks, straps, or blankets is highly recommended so that the \nwork can be done in a gradual way that doesn’t excessively disturb the rhythm \nof the breath.\n108\nKurmasana\nTurtle Pose\nkoor-MAHS-anna\nkurma = tortoise, turtle\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced seated forward bend\nJoint Actions\nCervical extension; thoracic and lumbar flexion, moving toward extension; \nsacroiliac nutation; hip flexion, abduction, neutral rotation; knee extension; \nankle dorsiflexion; scapula elevation, downward rotation, and abduction, \nmoving toward adduction and lateral rotation; glenohumeral joint lateral \nabduction and internal rotation; elbow extension; forearm pronation.\nWorking\nGravity pulls the torso toward the floor.\nSpinal extensors\nGracilis\nHamstrings\nSpinal extensors\n109\nSpinal extensors can act to deepen hip flexion against the resistance of the arms. \nThe extension of the spine presses the arms in this position against the legs, flex-\ning the hips and knees, so the hamstrings activate to extend the hips. The vastii \nalso extend the knees.\nThe rhomboids and trapezius activate to adduct the scapulae; the posterior \ndeltoids press the arms against the legs; and the biceps resist hyperextension in \nthe elbows.\nLengthening\nLegs (similar to upavistha konasana): The piriformis and gluteus maximus are \nworking eccentrically because they are extensors of the hip; the obtura-\ntor externus and quadratus femoris are working eccentrically because they \nare also adductors. Of the adductors, the gracilis is especially stretched \nbecause of the knee extension; the pectineus is not affected because of \nthe hip flexion. In the hamstrings, the semitendinosus and semimembrano-\nsus are particularly lengthened here because of the abduction of the legs.\nSpine: Extensors of the spine are lengthening, but active. As the pose deep-\nens, it moves toward more thoracic extension. Spinal extensors lengthen to \nenter into the pose, then activate. Similarly, the rhomboids lengthen to get \ninto the pose, then contract to reposition the scapulae.\nObstacles and Notes\nTo prepare for this pose, the spine flexes, the scapulae abduct, and the hips and \nknees flex. Once the arms are in position under the legs, the actions that deepen \nthe pose are the reversal of the preparatory ones: spinal extension, scapula \nadduction, and knee extension.\nThis opposition of actions in the spine and scapulae mean that muscles such as \nthe spinal extensors and rhomboids are asked to contract from a very lengthened \nposition (one of the more challenging positions from which to concentrically con-\ntract a muscle).\nBecause the arms are “bound” under the legs, there is the potential for forc-\ning the action into vulnerable spots: The spine could overflex in the lumbar or \nthoracic regions, or the hamstrings could overstretch at their attachment on the \nsitting bones.\nBreathing\nThe diaphragm receives considerable compression when entering into this \nposition, and the gradual movement out of thoracic flexion can be seen as an \nattempt to reestablish the breathing space in the thoracic cavity.\n(continued)\n110\nKurmasana Variation\nSupta Kurmasana\nReclining Turtle Pose\nJoint capsules are shaded in blue.\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced seated forward bend\nJoint Actions\nFull spinal flexion; sacroiliac nutation; hip flexion, external rotation, adduction; \nknee flexion; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula downward rotation, abduction; \nglenohumeral internal rotation, extension, adduction; elbow flexion; fore-\narm—left in pronation, right in supination.\nWorking\nGravity, and the tensegrity of the posture, which is bound.\nTo enter the pose, spinal flexors (psoas major, rectus abdominis, obliques \ninternal and external) are activated.\nLegs: Adductor longus and brevis to externally rotate, flex, and adduct, with \nhelp from the obturator externus and quadratus femoris (of the rotators, \nthe ones that do the most adduction).\nArms: Subscapularis, to internally rotate the humerus; pectoralis minor, to \ndownwardly rotate the scapulae; teres major, to internally rotate and \nextend the arm; posterior deltoid, to extend the arm; triceps long head, to \nextend the arm.\nKurmasana  (continued)\n111\nLengthening\nHamstrings, gluteus maximus (due to deep hip flexion); gluteus medius and \nminimus (due to hip adduction); piriformis, obturator internus, gemelli \n(due to hip flexion and adduction); adductor magnus (due to external hip \nrotation and flexion).\nAll spinal extensors are lengthening.\nThe anterior deltoids, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major (due to the exten-\nsion of the arms); trapezius and rhomboids (due to the abduction of the \nscapulae).\nObstacles and Notes\nUsing the latissimus dorsi to help internally rotate and extend the arms will inter-\nfere with the flexion of the spine, because the latissimus dorsi are also spinal \nextensors.\nThis pose has the potential for directing too much force into the spine, sac-\nroiliac joint, and, with the arms bound in this position, the front of the shoulder \njoint. The subscapularis is working to both internally rotate the humerus and pro-\ntect the joint from protraction.\nThe more freedom there is in the scapulae gliding on the rib cage, the less \nforce will be directed into the glenohumeral joint and its capsule.\nThe bound position of the legs behind the skull and cervical spine creates \npotential stress in this area, too—either overstretching the back of the neck or \noverworking the muscles against the push of the legs.\nIf there isn’t enough mobility in the rest of the spine, the cervical spine can be \noverflexed to get the legs in position. This should be avoided.\nBreathing\nGood luck. Actually, once locked into this bound pose, the abdominal muscles \ndon’t have much to do, so they can be released for good old belly breaths. This \nis actually advisable, because excessive abdominal action during trunk flexion can \nstress an already vulnerable neck.\n112\nMahamudra\nThe Great Seal\nma-ha-MOO-dra\nmaha = great, mighty, strong\nmudra = sealing, shutting, closing\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced seated pose for breath practice\nJoint Actions\nSpine: atlanto-occipital joint flexion; strong axial extension; mild axial rotation \nin the thoracic spine (necessitated by the turning of the pelvis). Extended \nleg: hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle is pulled \ninto dorsiflexion. Folded leg: hip flexion, abduction, external rotation; knee \nflexion; ankle plantarflexion; foot supination. Shoulders and arms: scapula \nupward rotation, slight abduction, elevation; glenohumeral flexion and \nadduction; elbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist neutral extension; \nhand and finger flexion working against the pressure of the foot.\nExternal intercostals\nSpinal extensors\nInternal obliques\nLower \nabdominals \n(deep)\nGastrocnemius\nHamstrings\nPelvic diaphragm\n113\nWorking\nSpine: Extensors against the pull of gravity into flexion. Extended-leg-side \ninternal obliques and folded-leg-side external obliques act together to \nrotate the spine to face the extended leg; the folded-leg-side rotatores and \nmultifidi act to rotate the spine toward the extended leg.\nBandhas: Mula (root lock): deep, lower abdominal muscles (internal obliques, \ntransversus abdominis) and pelvic diaphragm (levator ani, coccygeus). \nUddiyana (rib cage lift): external intercostals and costal fibers of the dia-\nphragm (to maintain the circumference at the base of the rib cage) and \nscalenes for lifting the sternum. Jalandhara (chin lock): sternocleidomas-\ntoids bilaterally to flex skull on spine.\nLegs: At this angle, gravity acts to flex the hips (as opposed to the vertical of \ndandasana). The psoas major and iliacus can act to deepen and stabilize \nthe hip flexion.\nExtended leg: The adductor magnus and pectineus act to internally rotate \nand adduct the leg; the vastii work to extend the knee (hopefully without \nthe rectus femoris, whose action would create congestion in the hip in this \nposition).\nBlue areas show the base of support.\nPelvic diaphragm\n(continued)\n114\nFolded leg: Gravity acts to nutate the sacrum and flex the hip. The obtura-\ntor externus, quadratus femoris, piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli \nexternally rotate the hip; the sartorius externally rotates and flexes the hip \nand knee; the hamstrings act to flex the knee; the tibialis anterior flexes \nthe ankle and supinates the foot.\nArms: The serratus anterior upwardly rotates the scapula; the anterior del-\ntoid and pectoralis major flex and adduct the arms; the triceps extend the \nelbow; flexor digitorum superficialis, profundus, lumbricals in the hand \ngrasp the toes.\nLengthening\nSpine: posterior suboccipitals (eccentrically), sternocleidomastoid.\nExtended leg: Hamstrings, gluteus maximus, piriformis, obturator internus, \ngemelli, some gluteus medius and minimus, gastrocnemius, soleus. Work-\ning at length (eccentrically), the popliteus moves the back of the knee \ntoward the floor.\nFolded leg: The adductor magnus mainly stretches because it creates internal \nrotation, extension, and adduction (as in baddha konasana). The adductor \nlongus and brevis also stretch because they flex and externally rotate the \nleg (abduction lengthens these two). There also might be some lengthen-\ning in the tensor fascia lata, because of the external rotation, and in the \nfibers of the gluteus medius and minimus with increasing hip flexion.\nArms: The rhomboids lengthen, as do the lower trapezius and latissimus dorsi.\nObstacles and Notes\nThe base of mahamudra is very similar to janu sirsasana, which it resembles. The \nsimilarity ends there, however, because the main action of this pose is strong \naxial spinal extension, which in turn arises from a deep application of the three \nbandhas (mula bandha, uddiyana bandha, and jalandhara bandha).\nA simplified way of thinking about this position is that it combines a forward \nbend (flexion of the lumbar and cervical spine), a backward bend (extension of \nthe thoracic spine), and a twist (axial rotation of the thoracic spine and the turn-\ning of the pelvis toward the extended leg).\nA lack of flexibility in any of the structures listed earlier in the “Lengthening” \nsection will lead to excessive action in the “Working” muscles. This will lead to \nthe expenditure of too much energy and the demand for too much oxygen—\nwhich will make it impossible to maintain the bandhas.\nMahamudra  (continued)\n115\nBreathing\nExecuting this pose properly while engaging all three bandhas is considered to be \nthe ultimate test of the breath. The reason for this is that mahamudra freezes all \nthe normal respiratory movements out of the body cavities: There is strong sta-\nbilizing action in the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, the rib cage is held in a \nlifted position, the costovertebral joints are immobilized by thoracic twisting, and \nthe sternum is lifted into the chin by the scalenes. All in all, the body is forced to \nfind another, unusual way to breathe.\nWhen all the usual, visible, external breath movements have been stabilized, \nsomething deep in the core of the system must mobilize via a new pathway. That \npathway is commonly referred to in yogic literature as susumna—the central \nchannel.\n116\nNavasana\nBoat Pose\nnah-VAHS-anna\nnava = boat\nClassification and Level\nBasic seated balance—abdominal strengthener\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral extension, resisting flexion; sacroiliac joint neutral, resisting \ncounternutation; hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; \nankle neutral extension; scapula neutral (if arms extended to shoulder \nheight); glenohumeral joint flexion, lateral adduction, slight external rota-\ntion; forearm neutral rotation.\nWorking\nSpine: The psoas major and spinal extensors work to maintain neutral align-\nment against the pull of gravity; the abdominal muscles work eccentrically \nto resist the hyperextension of the lumbar spine. The abdominal muscles \nalso resist the bulging forward of the abdominal organs, which bear the \nweight of the thorax and arms.\nRectus femoris\nHamstrings\nRectus \nabdominis\nSpinal extensors\nSternocleidomastoid\n117\nLegs: The psoas major and iliacus flex the hips; the rectus femoris flexes the \nhips and extends the knees; the vastii extend the knees; the gracilis and \npectineus adduct and flex the hip joints; the tensor fascia latae support \nflexion and internal rotation; the sartorius supports flexion at the hip joints.\nVariation with arms extended.\nObstacles and Notes\nIn this pose the challenge is not the position itself, so much as its relationship to \ngravity. If it were rotated 45 degrees, it would just be the work of sitting verti-\ncally in dandasana (which can certainly present its own challenges).\nIdeally, the weight in this pose is distributed between the sitting bones and the \ntailbone. All the weight should not be borne on the sacrum, because that would \ncreate a destabilizing counternutation in the sacroiliac joints.\nIf dandasana is a challenge because of tight hamstrings, that tightness will \nmake it impossible to support this pose correctly with the legs straight. In this \ncase, bending the knees so the spine can remain neutral is a good option.\nIt is an interesting challenge to have to work hard to maintain a neutral spine, \nas opposed to working to get the spine into flexion, extension, or rotation.\nThis asana is often described as working the abdominal muscles. This is true; \nhowever, the abdominal muscles do not hold the weight of the pose. Rather, \nthey are modulators of the action of creating hip flexion, which is mainly per-\nformed by the psoas major and iliacus. If the psoas is difficult to access, it is pos-\nsible to overwork the rectus femoris or tensor fascia latae in this pose.\nJust as bending the knees makes this pose easier by shortening the length of \nthe lower lever arm, stretching the arms overhead would make it more difficult \nby lengthening the upper lever arm.\nBreathing\nTo maintain the stability and balance of this pose, the breath must be very \nrestrained and focused. To illustrate how vital this is, attempt to do navasana \nwhile taking deep belly breaths.\nArms: The serratus anterior and \nrhomboids hold the scapulae \non the rib cage; the infraspi-\nnatus and teres minor exter-\nnally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; the coracobrachialis \nand anterior deltoids flex and \nlaterally adduct at the gleno-\nhumeral joints; the triceps and \nanconeus extend the elbows.\nLengthening\nHamstrings.\n119\nkneeling poses\n119\n6\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\nW\nhen kneeling, the body’s weight is on the knees, shins, and parts of the feet.\nKneeling brings the center of gravity closer to the ground and makes certain activi-\nties, such as gardening, less stressful for the spine. Without proper care, however, kneeling \ncan be stressful for the knee joints.\nThis position is also associated with “lowering oneself” in the sense of meekness or wor-\nship. This probably evolved from the fact that when kneeling, a person is defenseless and \nunable to flee. Even the proud, upright stance of kings and pharaohs is tempered by their \nfrequent depiction in this humble position.\nIn yoga, kneeling poses are often used to help open the hip and knee joints. When the \nbody’s weight is taken off the feet and legs, the pelvic muscle attachments can be stretched \nbecause they no longer stabilize the body weight high off the ground.\nKneeling also provides a stable base from which the center of gravity can be raised up so \nthe spine can fully extend—most beautifully expressed in poses such as camel (ustrasana) \nand pigeon (kapotasana).\nA position that’s frequently used to counterpose strong spinal extensions is child’s pose, the \nkneeling position that produces mild, even spinal flexion and lowers the center of gravity.\nThe vajrasana pose.\nThe virasana pose.\nChild’s pose.\n120\nSupta Virasana\nReclining Hero Pose\nsoup-tah veer-AHS-anna\nsupta = reclining, lain down to sleep\nvira = a brave or eminent man, hero, chief\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate reclining groin stretch\nPectoralis \nmajor\nRectus abdominis\nRectus femoris\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nPsoas \nmajor\nGluteus \nmaximus\nTibialis \nanterior\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nExtensor \nhallucis \nlongus\nTibialis \nanterior\nExtensor \ndigitorum \nlongus\nPeroneus \nlongus\nJoint Actions\nSpine axial extension (in the full version of the pose); sacroiliac joint coun-\nternutation; hip extension, internal rotation, and adduction; knee flexion \nand tibia medially rotated; ankle plantarflexion; scapula upward rotation, \nabduction, elevation; glenohumeral joint flexion, external rotation; elbow \nflexion.\n121\nWorking\nReclining hero is a released hip opener in which the goal is to relax as much as \npossible into gravity. The lower abdominal muscles can be activated to prevent \nhyperextension in the lumbar spine and to lengthen the psoas major.\nLengthening\nRectus abdominis, psoas major (the lower part at first, and the upper part as \nthe pose deepens), iliacus, rectus femoris, sartorius, perhaps the tensor \nfascia latae, gluteus medius and minimus; vastii, tibialis anterior, extensor \ndigitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus; piriformis, gemelli, and obtura-\ntor internus (because of internal rotation and adduction); adductor longus \nand brevis (because of internal rotation and extension); pectineus (because \nof hip extension).\nObstacles and Notes\nThere are many variations for the arm position in this pose—at the sides, reach-\ning overhead, and propped up on the elbows (for the less flexible). If the latissi-\nmus dorsi are tight, reaching the arms overhead can increase the hyperextension \nof the spine because of the attachment of the latissimus in the lower back.\nBecause hip extension in internal rotation is more challenging than in external \nrotation for most people, supta virasana “forces” the pelvis to be honest about \nhow open the groins truly are. This pose often begins as spinal extension, espe-\ncially if there is tightness in the hip flexors, because the internal rotation of the \nlegs is bound into place by the weight of the body.\nIf the hip extensors are tight and the pose is “pushed,” the force can be \ntransmitted either into the lower back or into the knees. In either case, the pose \nshould be supported in a way that allows for maximum hip extension; getting \ndown to the floor is less important.\nBecause the knees are at risk, keeping the feet active and avoiding supination \nis important for maintaining integrity in the knee joints.\nThis can be an excellent pose for sciatic and lower-back pain, if done with \nattention to the internal rotation and extension in the hips. If poorly executed, \nthe pose can exacerbate lower-back pain.\nBreathing\nThe tautness in the psoas and abdominal wall creates both posterior and anterior \npressure in the abdominal cavity. This effect is magnified when activating the \nabdominal muscles to flatten the lumbar curve. The resulting breathing patterns \nwould favor movements above and below the abdominal pressure.\nEmphasizing thoracic breath movements at the base of the rib cage helps to \nmobilize the upper spine and shoulder girdle. Focusing on pelvic floor move-\nments assists in releasing tension in the hips, groin, and gluteal region.\n122\nBalasana\nChild’s Pose, Embryo Pose\nBAH-las-anna\nbala = young, childish, not fully grown or developed\nClassification and Level\nBasic kneeling forward bend\nSpinal extensors\nHamstrings\nTibialis anterior\nExtensor digitorum longus\nPeroneus tertius\nPeroneus brevis\n123\nJoint Actions\nFull spinal flexion (maybe slight cervical extension, depending on the head \nposition or the length of the neck); hip flexion, neutral rotation, adduction; \nknee flexion; ankle plantarflexion; scapula abduction and downward rota-\ntion; glenohumeral internal rotation; elbow extension; forearm pronation.\nWorking\nGravity draws the yielding body deeper into this position.\nLengthening\nThe challenge of this pose is to bring the sitting bones to the heels and \nthe forehead to the floor. To do so, many things have to lengthen: the \nextensors of the spine, gluteus maximus, piriformis and other rotators, \nhamstrings, gluteus medius and minimus (because of hip adduction), tibi-\nalis anterior, peroneus tertius, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and \nextensor hallucis longus and brevis in the feet.\nObstacles and Notes\nVariations include widening the knees (hip abduction), which can create more \nneutral extension in the spine and make room for the belly; extending the arms \noverhead; clasping the heels with the hands; crossing the arms under the fore-\nhead; and turning the head to one side.\nSometimes there is congestion in the front of the hip joints, which can be \ncaused by using the hip flexors to pull the body down toward the thighs, rather \nthan allowing gravity to create that action. The use of props can assist in this \nrelease.\nRestriction can also be felt in the tops of the feet, if the extensors of the toes \nare tight or if there is a lack of mobility in the bones of the foot. Additionally, \nweakness in the intrinsic muscles of the foot will often result in cramping in this, \nand similar positions (such as virasana and vajrasana).\nBreathing\nWith the hips fully flexed, or adducted, and the front of the torso resting on the \nanterior surface of the thighs, the movement of the breath in the abdomen and \nanterior rib cage is greatly restricted. This necessitates more movement in the \nback of the waist and rib cage. That’s why if there is tightness in those places, \nthis pose can feel suffocating.\n124\nUstrasana\nCamel Pose\noosh-TRAHS-anna\nustra = camel\nClassification and Level\nBasic kneeling backbend\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension; hip extension and internal rotation; knee extension; scapula \ndownward rotation, adduction, elevation; arm external rotation, extension, \nadduction; elbow extension.\nWorking\nGravity is pulling the torso into the backbend, which is checked by the arm \naction and the eccentric action of the spinal flexors.\nArms: The triceps extend the glenohumeral and elbow joints; the trapezius and \nrhomboids adduct the scapulae. The posterior deltoids and teres major also \nextend the glenohumeral joint, while the subscapularis protects it anteriorly.\nTrapezius\nSternocleidomastoid\nDeltoid\nPectoralis \nmajor\nRectus \nabdominis\nPectoralis \nminor\nApex of \nlung\nHamstrings\nVastus lateralis\nRectus femoris\nPsoas major\n125\nSpine: In the cervical spine, the anterior neck muscles (longus capitis, longus \ncolli, rectus capitis anterior, suprahyoid, and infrahyoid) work eccentrically \nto keep the head from collapsing. Also working eccentrically to prevent \ncollapsing into the lumbar spine are the rectus abdominis, obliques (espe-\ncially external), intercostals, subcostals, iliacus, and psoas major and minor.\nLegs: The rectus femoris is working eccentrically against the weight of the \npelvis moving backward, and the vastii are working concentrically to press \nthe shins into the floor. The hamstrings and adductor magnus are also \nworking concentrically—mainly to stabilize the knee and hip joints.\nLengthening\nArms: Pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, biceps, and anterior del-\ntoids all stretch.\nSpine: In the cervical spine, the anterior neck muscles listed earlier are work-\ning at length, but the sternocleidomastoid should be lengthened and \nrelaxed to avoid the base of the skull being pulled into the atlas and axis. \nThe scalenes are also providing support for the anterior spine, as well as \nthe breath (discussed later). In the thoracic region, the internal intercostals \nare stretched by the opening of the rib cage, as are the scalenes (which are \nthe cranial continuation of the intercostal layers).\nObstacles and Notes\nIn camel, a mild internal rotation of the legs is recommended to keep the sacro-\niliac joints stable, which will favor hip and spinal extension over sacroiliac coun-\nternutation (which is what happens when this pose is felt “in the small of the \nback”).\nIt can be very challenging to find a healthy extension of the spine at the base \nof the neck or the top of the thoracic spine. It helps to focus on releasing the \nsternocleidomastoid using the eccentric strength of the deeper anterior neck \nmuscles to stabilize the weight of the head. Additionally, in many people, the \nupper trapezius muscles form a “shelf” in this position that can provide a resting \nplace for some of the weight of the head.\nCamel is an intense stretch for the digestive system, especially the esophagus.\nBreathing\nIn ustrasana, the thoracic structures are maintained in an “inhaled” position, and \nthe abdominal wall is stretched. This results in a decreased ability of the body to \nbreathe “normally.” The trick is to find support from the deeper musculature so \nthe more superficial efforts can quiet down. Then it’s possible to notice an inter-\nesting relationship between the deepest layer of superficial neck muscles (sca-\nlenes) and the breath movement in the apex of the lungs, which are suspended \nfrom the inner scalene muscles.\n126\nEka Pada Rajakapotasana\nOne-Legged Royal Pigeon Pose\neh-KAH pah-DAH rah-JAH-cop-poh-TAHS-anna\neka = one\npada = foot, leg\nraja = king, royal\nkapota = dove, pigeon\nTriceps\nPsoas \nmajor\nIliacus\nGluteus \nmaximus\nPectoralis major \nExternal obliques\nRectus abdominis\nQuadriceps\nTensor fascia lata\nTriceps\nPectoralis \nmajor\nRectus \nabdominis\nSerratus \nanterior\nSpinal \nextensors\nSerratus \nanterior\nGluteus \nmaximus\n127\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced kneeling backbend\nThis pose is categorized with kneeling because that is the starting position, but \nthe base of support is not actually kneeling. This asana has a unique base of sup-\nport: the back surface of the front leg and the front surface of the back leg. This \nsame base, with the knee joints extended, would be hanumanasana.\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension. Front leg: nutation; hip flexion, external rotation, and \nabduction; knee flexion; ankle and foot supination. Back leg: counternuta-\ntion; hip extension, internal rotation, and adduction; knee flexion; ankle \nplantarflexion.\nWorking\nSpine: The spinal extensors work to create the backbend; then the extensors \nand obliques work to maintain balance and an orientation to the front. The \nactions in the spine are very similar in this pose to those in natarajasana \n(see chapter 4), although the action of gravity is slightly different (there \nis perhaps less anterior tilt to the pelvis, and thus more action in the back \nhip).\nBack leg: Same action as natarajasana; the internal rotation and extension has \nthe joint capsule most taut.\nArms: Same action as natarajasana.\nFront leg: Gravity is the main force. The hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and \nperoneals work eccentrically, pressing into the floor, to keep from collaps-\ning into the pose.\nLengthening\nWhen the front leg is abducted, there is generally less stretch of the rotators, \nalthough the obturator externus and quadratus femoris are slightly more length-\nened with abduction. More stretch is actually felt in the hamstrings, in spite of \nthe knee flexion.\nWhen the front leg is adducted, the action of flexion and adduction at the hip \nlengthens the piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli mainly—and the obtura-\ntor externus and quadratus femoris slightly less.\nWhen the knee is more extended in the front leg (toward 90 degrees of flex-\nion), the rotation at the hip is greatly intensified. This action may be felt in the \ngluteus medius and minimus, and/or in the adductor magnus or adductor longus. \nThis action puts more pressure into the knee, especially if there is restriction in \nthe hip joint, and the knee is much more vulnerable to twisting forces when at \n90 degrees. The action in the feet and ankles can help to stabilize and protect the \nknee.\n(continued)\n128\nFolded forward variation.\nThis variation intensifies the action in the ham-\nstrings of the front leg because of deeper hip \nflexion and more body weight over the front leg. \nAt the same time, it diminishes the action in the \nback hip and in the spine. By adducting the front \nleg, the piriformis is brought into the lengthening \naction.\nThis is perhaps the most frequently used \nstretch for the infamous piriformis. Because this \nmuscle crosses over the largest nerve in the body, \nthe sciatic nerve, tightness in this muscle can be \na cause of sciatic pain. This variation of pigeon \npose helps to release tension in the piriformis in \na mostly passive, relaxed position, as opposed \nto the more active base required of the full \npigeon. Being a deep hip stabilizer, the piriformis \nrequires at least a minute of sustained stretching \nto release its spindle reflex and actually begin \nlengthening. Before the release of the spindles, \nthe main sensation is actually of the muscles \nresisting the stretch to protect themselves from \ninjury. When viewing this pose from underneath, \nyou can see clearly that the sciatic nerve is also \nstretched in this position.\nPiriformis\nVastus \nlateralis\nPsoas \nmajor\nBiceps \nfemoris\nEka Pada Rajakapotasana  (continued)\nObstacles and Notes\nIt is important not to collapse into this pose. The pelvic floor, hamstrings, and \ngluteals should act eccentrically to distribute the weight force of gravity through \nthe whole base of the pose rather than drop right into the hamstring attachment \nor knee joint.\nAs with all poses, and more so with complex ones, a wide variety of experi-\nences are available, depending on each person’s strength, balance, and range of \nmotion.\nVariation\nFolded Forward\nSciatic nerve\nSciatic \nnerve\n129\nThe following illustrations show the relationship of the sciatic nerve to the piri-\nformis muscle in the following:\n1.\t Neutral hip position (figure a).\n2.\t External rotation and abduction, which actually shortens the piriformis \n(figure b).\n3.\t Hip flexion, which begins the stretch of the piriformis and other external \nrotators (figure c).\n4.\t Hip flexion combined with adduction, which puts the piriformis into maxi-\nmal stretch, along with the sciatic nerve (figure d).\nWhen entering this stretch from the kneeling position, the hip joint is already \nin flexion. It is then externally rotated as it’s brought into maximal flexion, and \nthen moved into adduction before the body’s weight is placed on it. As men-\ntioned previously, extending the knee joint to 90 degrees greatly increases the \ntorque on the hip joint, and thus the stretch to the rotators, but poses greater risk \nto the knee joint.\nThe hip joint, sciatic nerve, and piriformis muscle in four positions as they go into the folded \nforward pigeon variation: (a) neutral, (b) externally rotated, (c) externally rotated and flexed, \nand (d) externally rotated, flexed, and adducted.\nb\na\nd\nc\nPiriformis\nSciatic nerve\nSacrotuberous \nligament \nshowing \ncontinuity with \nthe orgin of the \nHamstring\n130\nClassification and Level\nBasic kneeling side bend\nJoint Actions\nSpine lateral flexion (some rotation to maintain neutral alignment), cervical \nrotation and extension, sacroiliac neutral. Standing leg: hip neutral exten-\nsion, adduction, internal rotation; knee flexion; ankle dorsiflexion (to press \ninto the floor for balance). Extended leg: hip flexion, external rotation, \nabduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion. Top arm: scapula upward \nrotation, elevation; glenohumeral joint external rotation, elevation, flexion; \nelbow extension; forearm supination. Bottom arm: neutral scapula; gleno-\nhumeral external rotation; forearm supination.\nWorking\nSpine: Gravity works on the weight of the torso to pull it toward the floor, so \nthe upper (long side) lengthens eccentrically in the external obliques. Also, \nto resist the front of the body twisting toward the extended leg, the upper-\nside internal obliques and lower-side external obliques work concentrically.\nLatissimus dorsi\nIntercostals\nExternal \nobliques\nTensor \nfascia \nlata\nGracilis\nAdductor \nmagnus\nRectus \nfemoris\nParighasana\nGate-Latch Pose\npar-ee-GOSS-anna\nparigha = an iron bar used for locking a gate\n131\nLegs: Extended leg: sartorius, piriformis, gemelli, and obturator internus are \nactive to rotate and abduct the leg; the hamstrings and piriformis work to \nkeep from collapsing into the hip joint and/or hyperextending the knee; \nthe soleus and intrinsic muscles of the foot point the toes to the floor. \nKneeling leg: gluteus medius and minimus work eccentrically to keep the \nhip from shifting too laterally; the adductor magnus maintains internal \nrotation and hip extension, and the quadriceps extend the knee to press \nthe lower leg into the floor for balance, along with the dorsiflexors of the \nankle.\nArms: Top arm: serratus anterior to abduct and upwardly rotate the scapula; \ninfraspinatus and teres minor to externally rotate the glenohumeral joint; \ndeltoids to elevate the arm. The lower arm is mostly at rest.\nLengthening\nTop side: Rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, long head of triceps, intercostals, \nquadratus lumborum, external and internal obliques, gluteus medius and \nminimus, tensor fascia latae, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, iliacus, and \npsoas on the standing leg.\nExtended leg: Hamstrings, gracilis, adductor magnus.\nObstacles and Notes\nRotation is automatic with side bending in the spine because of both the shape \nof the articular facets in the vertebrae and the spiral pathways of the muscles. To \nkeep the action “pure” lateral flexion, there needs to be a counterrotation in the \nrib cage. In this case, the upper ribs rotate posteriorly and the lower ribs rotate \nanteriorly. To achieve this, the internal obliques on the upper side and the exter-\nnal obliques on the lower side are recruited.\nAlso, if there is tightness in the outside of the standing leg hip joint (in the \ntensor fascia lata, gluteus medius, or gluteus minimus), then that hip will try \nto flex rather than stay purely adducted. The standing leg should maintain hip \nextension (via the adductor magnus and hamstrings) to prevent this.\nWhen there is tightness in the latissimus dorsi, lifting the arm overhead can \npush the rib cage forward (compressing the floating ribs and inhibiting breath \nin general), or pull the scapula downward even as the arm is lifting—potentially \ncreating impingement of the biceps tendon or supraspinatus at the acromion pro-\ncess. Folding the upper arm behind the back eliminates this concern and allows \nthe focus to remain on the torso movement.\nBreathing\nWhich side of the diaphragm moves more in this pose—the upper, stretched side, \nor the lower, compressed side?

The platysma muscle can also be contracted in simhasana.

The tongue \nand jaw can be thought of as the front of the neck, and cervical tension can fre-\nquently be related to tightness in these structures. Additionally, the platysma (the \nflat, thin, rectangular muscle that covers the front of the throat) can be tonified \nduring simhasana. Aside from the cosmetic advantages (a weak platysma is asso-\nciated with wrinkly throat skin), consciously contracting this muscle increases the \nability to relax it during inspiratory efforts.\nAs a variation, this pose can also be done from kneeling.\nJaw muscles.\nMandible\nTongue\nTongue\nTeeth\nPterygoids\nMasseter\nTemporalis\nLower lip\nHyoid\n135\nsupine poses\n135\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\nS\nupine means lying in a faceup position. It is the opposite of prone, which is lying \nfacedown. Similarly, supination means to turn a hand, foot, or limb upward, whereas \npronation refers to turning them downward.\nBoth words originate in Latin: Supinus means “leaning backward,” and pronus means \n“leaning forward.” Interestingly, this is the reverse of what’s possible from each position. \nFrom a supine position, only forward movement (spinal flexion) is possible; from a prone \nposition, only backward movement (spinal extension) is possible.\nJust as tadasana and samasthiti are the quintessential standing positions, savasana is \nthe prototypical supine position. In the corpse pose, the back surface of the body becomes \nthe base of support, and all the postural muscles can relax from their constant dance with \ngravity.\nSavasana has the lowest center of gravity and is the starting point of all the supine poses. It \nis also the position in which those asanas usually end. Because no effort is required to stabilize \nthe body while it is supine, poses that evolve from here are—by definition—mostly langhana \n(see page 16) and become more brahmana as the center of gravity is raised higher.\nMoving into postures from a supine position engages the anterior musculature of the \nbody, which is why many abdominal strengthening exercises start in this position.\n136\nSavasana\nCorpse Pose\nshah-VAHS-anna\nsava = corpse\nOccasionally, this pose is referred to as the death pose, or mrtasana (mrit-TAHS-\nanna). Mrta means death.\nClassification and Level\nDepending on the perspective, either very easy or very advanced\nWorking\nGravity and mental focus.\nThe corpse pose is said to be the easiest asana to perform, but the hardest to \nmaster. Whatever gymnastics demands the other asanas may make to your bal-\nance, strength, or flexibility, the challenge of completely releasing the tension \nfrom every part of the body and mind is perhaps the greatest test of the yogi.\nAnatomy\nPrimary and Secondary Curves\nIn savasana, the structures that are in full, weight-bearing contact with the floor \nexhibit the primary curves of the body (see chapter 2). These include the pos-\nterior surfaces of the calcaneus, gastocnemius, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, \nsacrum, thoracic spine, scapulae, and occiput.\nThe structures that are off the floor mirror the secondary curves of the body—\nspecifically, the posterior surfaces of the Achilles tendons, knee joints, lumbar \nregion, and cervical spine.\nThe point of contact of the arms varies widely from person to person, depend-\ning on the unique shape and relationships of the upper-body structures—particu-\nlarly the elbow joint.\n137\nSymmetry\nMany people never fully relax in savasana because of an obsession with arrang-\ning the body in a perfectly symmetrical shape, which they verify visually, but \nwhich conflicts with the body’s kinesthetic (proprioceptive) feedback. In other \nwords, what looks symmetrical is not what feels symmetrical.\nBecause all human bodies are inherently asymmetrical, a certain amount of \nsurrender to this fact is necessary to achieve a deep state of emotional, as well as \nphysical, relaxation. If you want to fully relax, you need to accept your body as it \nis, not as you would wish it to be.\nBreathing\nA deep state of conscious relaxation is quite different from sleep, which is a \ncommon experience in this pose. In savasana, the body is completely at rest and \nits metabolism is freed of the demands of contending with gravity, making it pos-\nsible to practice the most difficult breathing exercise of all: the act of being fully \naware of—but not controlling—the breath’s movements.\nNormally, when you are aware of your breathing, in some way you alter its \nnatural rhythm. When you are not aware of the breath, it is driven by a combi-\nnation of autonomic impulses and unconscious habit. The juxtaposition of active \nawareness and surrender to the breath’s natural movements makes possible the \npowerful realization that true surrender is an act of will.\nBlue areas show the weight-bearing structures, including the primary curves.\n138\nDwi Pada Pitham\nTwo-Legged Table\ndvee PA-da PEET-ham\ndwi = two\npada = feet\npitham = stool, seat, chair, bench\nInhale.\nExhale.\nQuadriceps\nTibialis \nanterior\nHamstrings\nGluteus maximus\nDeltoids\n139\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine vinyasa\nExcept for the arm position, the muscular, spinal, and joint actions of this pose \nare virtually identical to those of setu bandhasana (which is described later in this \nchapter).\nThe main difference between setu bandhasana and dwi pada pitham is that \ndwi pada pitham is a vinyasa, a dynamic movement that is coordinated with the \ninhalation and exhalation.\nThis simple, yet versatile practice can be used in a variety of ways to release \ntension from the spine and breathing structures, as well as to help balance the \nleg and hip actions that support similar poses, such as setu bandhasana and \nupward bow, or wheel (see chapter 9).\nBreathing\nThe lifting movement is typically done on the inhalation and the lowering on \nthe exhalation, but this pattern can be changed to produce various effects. For \nexample, the three bandhas can be very easily activated simply by doing the low-\nering movement on an external retention (bhaya kumbaka). Lowering the spine \non a retention after an exhalation creates a natural lifting of the pelvic floor and \nabdominal contents toward the zone of lowered pressure in the thoracic cavity. \nThe subsequent inhalation can create a dramatic downward release of the pelvic \nfloor and a noticeable sense of relaxation in this often tense region.\n140\nApanasana\nApana Pose\nap-AN-ahs-anna\napana = the “vital air” that eliminates waste from the system\nInhale.\nExhale.\n141\nAnother simple, yet useful practice that directly \nlinks breath and body movement, apanasana \nis one of the key tools of therapeutic yoga. \nIt stimulates the upward release of the dia-\nphragm on the exhalation, as the knees are \ndrawn into the body. Traditionally this is done \nby actively using the abdominal and hip flexor \nmuscles without the assistance of the arms, \nwhich are just “along for the ride.” An inter-\nesting difference can be felt if the hip flexors \nand abdominal muscles are relaxed and the \narms are used actively to “pump” the thighs against the abdomen, deepening \nthe exhalation.\nBecause so much lower-back tension is the result of a tense diaphragm, apa-\nnasana is one of the simplest and most effective ways of helping the lower spine, \nby creating more diaphragmatic “space” for the abdominal muscles to create \npostural support.\nTaken together, dwi pada pitham and apanasana constitute a powerful pair \nof counterposing movements that can dramatically reverse some of the most \ncommon health complaints.\nBiceps\nTriceps\nDeltoids\n142\nViparita Karani\nInverted Pose\nvip-par-ee-tah car-AHN-ee\nviparita = turned around, reversed, inverted\nkarani = doing, making, action\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine inversion\nJoint Actions\nSpine cervical and upper thoracic \nflexion; lower thoracic and lumbar \nextension; hip flexion, adduction, \ninternal rotation; knee extension; \nankle neutral extension; scapula \nadduction, downward rotation, ele-\nvation; glenohumeral joint external \nrotation, extension, adduction; \nelbow flexion; forearm supination; \nwrist extension (dorsiflexion).\nWorking\nSpine: Psoas minor, obliques, rectus abdominis, and transversus, eccentrically, \nto resist gravity; the muscles of the anterior rib cage, to resist the weight of \nthe lower body.\nLegs: Pectineus, to adduct, flex, and internally rotate the legs; adductor \nmagnus, to adduct and internally rotate; tensor fascia latae may help with \ninternal rotation and flexion; vastii, to extend knees.\nShoulders: Rhomboids, to adduct scapulae; levator scapulae, to elevate \nscapulae (in this case, press scapulae into the floor) and medially rotate the \nbottom tips of the scapulae (which tips the glenoid fossa downward); tra-\npezius, to adduct, elevate, and medially rotate the bottom tips of the scap-\nulae. Pectoralis minor is also active to downwardly rotate the scapulae (the \nmore adduction of the scapulae, the less the pectoralis minor can work).\nArms: Infraspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; subscapularis and coracobrachialis, eccentrically, to protect the \nfront of the joint from protraction; long head of triceps and teres major, to \nextend the shoulder and adduct the arm; posterior deltoid, to extend and \nexternally rotate the arm; biceps brachii and brachialis, to flex the elbow \nand supinate the forearm; flexor carpi radialis, ulnaris, and flexor digitorum \nsuperficialis and profundus, eccentrically, to support the weight of the hips.\nHamstrings\nExternal obliques\n143\nLengthening\nAbdominal muscles are lengthening as they are working, eccentrically, the \nmuscles of the anterior rib cage.\nLegs: Hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus might feel mild lengthening.\nShoulders: Serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, pectoralis major, possibly pecto-\nralis minor (depending on the angle of the upper rib cage to the scapulae).\nArms: Flexors of the forearm and hand are working eccentrically, lengthening \nwhile holding the weight of the pelvis and legs.\nObstacles and Notes\nIn a shoulder stand, the erector muscles of the spine are more active than in \nviparita karani. In the “lifted” version of viparita karani, the abdominal muscles \nplay a greater role than the spinal muscles to keep the pelvis from collapsing onto \nthe hands.\nIn viparita karani the abdominal muscles are \nstrongly active in eccentric contraction. If they do \nnot have the ability to modulate their lengthen-\ning, the weight of the pelvis will collapse onto \nthe hands or wrists. Practicing the ability to enter \nand leave this pose will help with other actions \nthat require abdominal eccentric control—for \nexample, dropping the legs over into the wheel \nfrom a headstand or handstand, controlling \nvrksasana, dropping back into the wheel from \ntadasana, and so forth.\nBody proportions and individual differences \nin weight distribution between the upper and \nlower body will greatly affect the experience of \nthis pose. A prime example is how challenging \n(strengthwise) it can be for women because of \nthe greater proportion of weight in their lower \nbodies and the greater flexibility of their spines, \ncompared with men (which makes their abdomi-\nnal muscles work extra hard to stabilize).\nBreathing\nThis position offers the opportunity to experience all three bandhas: the lower \nabdominal action of mula bandha, the opening at the base of the rib cage (sup-\nported by the hand position) of uddiyana bandha, and the chin lock associated \nwith cervical flexion known as jalandhara bandha.\nThe inverted nature of viparita karani produces the cleansing, eliminative \neffects associated with the upward movement of apana. The supported versions \nof this pose are a valuable staple of restorative yoga practice.\nDropped version of viparita karani.\n144\nSalamba Sarvangasana\nSupported Shoulder Stand\nsah-LOM-bah sar-van-GAHS-anna\nsalamba = with support (sa = with, alamba = support)\nsarva = all\nanga = limb\nThe term salamba distinguishes this \nvariation of the shoulder stand from the \nunsupported (niralamba) version.\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine inversion\nJoint Actions\nSpine cervical flexion; thoracic \nflexion; lumbar flexion moving \ntoward neutral extension; sac-\nroiliac joint nutation; hip neutral \nextension, adduction, neutral \nrotation; knee extension; ankle \nneutral extension; scapula adduc-\ntion, downward rotation, eleva-\ntion; glenohumeral joint external \nrotation, extension, adduction; \nelbow flexion; forearm supina-\ntion; wrist extension (moving \ntoward flexion as the hands press \ninto the back).\nWorking\nSpine: The intrinsic muscles of the spine (intertransversarii, interspinalis, rota-\ntores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius capitis and cervicis, longis-\nsimus, and iliocostalis) are all active in the shoulder stand to keep the legs \nfrom falling toward the face. The psoas minor, obliques, rectus abdominis, \nand transversus are very active in the pose to keep from falling backward.\nWorking eccentrically in the neck: rectus capitis posterior major and minor, \nobliquus capitis superior and inferior.\n145\nLegs: To maintain a neutral alignment of the legs against the pull of gravity, \nthe adductor magnus and hamstrings hold the legs together and extend \nthe hips. The vastii extend the knees. The medial fibers of the gluteus \nmaximus act to extend the hips (without external rotation).\nShoulders: The rhomboids work to adduct the scapulae; levator scapulae \nelevate the scapulae (in this case, to press their upper edges into the floor), \nand also medially rotate the bottom tips of the scapulae (which angles the \nglenoid fossa downward toward the hips). The trapezius acts to adduct, \nelevate, and medially rotate the bottom tips of the scapulae. The pectoralis \nminor is also active to downwardly rotate the scapulae. (Again, the more \nadduction of the scapulae, the less the pectoralis minor is active.)\nArms: The infraspinatus and teres minor externally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; the subscapularis and coracobrachialis work eccentrically to pro-\ntect the front of the joint from \nprotraction; the long head of \ntriceps and teres major act to \nextend the shoulder and adduct \nthe arm; the posterior deltoid \nworks to extend and externally \nrotate the arm; the biceps bra-\nchii and brachialis act to flex \nthe elbow and supinate the \nforearm; the flexor carpi radia-\nlis, ulnaris, and flexor digitorum \nsuperficialis and profundus \nwork to press the hands into \nthe back.\nObliquus \ncapitis superior\nRectus capitis \nposterior minor\nRectus capitis \nposterior major\nObliquus capitis \ninferior\nTrapezius\nTriceps\nSplenius capitis\nSplenius cervicis\nRhomboids\nPosterior \ndeltoid\nInfraspinatus\n(continued)\nSome of the deeper musculature attaching to the base of the skull that can be stretched in \nshoulder stand, plow pose, and variations.\nInterspinales \ncervicis\nLongissimus \ncapitis\nSplenius \ncapitis (cut)\nSemispinalis \ncapitis (cut)\n146\nSalamba Sarvangasana  (continued)\nLymph drainage in shoulder stand.\nCenter line of gravity passing through the base \nof support.\n147\nLengthening\nMuscles of thoracic spine are lengthened at the same time they are taking the \nweight of the lower thorax and legs.\nIn the shoulders, the serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major \nall lengthen.\nObstacles and Notes\nEntering the pose from the plow (halasana) is more demanding on the extensors \nof the spine, especially the thoracic spine, because they are in an elongated posi-\ntion before contracting. Entering from the bridge pose (setu bandhasana) is more \ndemanding on the extensors of the shoulder joints and the flexors of the spine \n(the psoas and abdominal muscles).\nFrom the perspective of the muscles of the spine and abdomen, being in this \npose is less challenging than getting into it. However, remaining in the pose is \nmore challenging for the muscles of the scapulae, because they are all bearing \nthe static load of the body while either contracting or lengthening.\nTo truly be a shoulder stand, the muscles that adduct, downwardly rotate, \nand elevate the scapulae must be strong enough to take the weight of the entire \nbody. If they are not, and the shoulders spread apart, the weight falls too much \non the upper thoracic and cervical spine.\nBreathing\nThe more mobility there is in the scapulae (or the less resistance from other mus-\ncles of the thorax), the less compromised the breath will be in this position. This \npose takes a tremendous amount of both flexibility and strength in the entire \nshoulder girdle. Without the integrity of the shoulder girdle, the weight collapses \ndown into the thorax, and the diaphragm becomes obstructed.\nKeeping the base of the rib cage open allows the diaphragm and abdominal \nviscera to shift effectively toward the head so the full benefits of inversion can \noccur.\n148\nNiralamba Sarvangasana\nUnsupported (No-Arm) Shoulder Stand\nneera-LOM-bah sar-van-GAHS-anna \nQuadriceps\nHamstrings\nGluteus \nmaximus\nGluteus \nmedius\nLatissimus \ndorsi\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate supine inversion\nJoint Actions\nSpine: Same as described in \nsalamba sarvangasana.\nLegs: Same as salamba sarvan-\ngasana. \nArms: Scapula adduction and \nupward rotation, elevation; \nglenohumeral joint external \nrotation, neutral flexion, \nadduction; elbow exten-\nsion; forearm pronation to \nneutral; wrist and finger \nextension to neutral.\nWorking\nSpine: Same as salamba sar-\nvangasana, plus the spinal \nflexors. The upper fibers \nof the psoas major and \nabdominal muscles engage \nstrongly to maintain the \nposition without the sup-\nport of the arms; eccentri-\ncally in the neck—rectus \ncapitis posterior major and \nminor, and obliquus capitis \nsuperior and inferior. Also deep anterior neck muscles—longus colli, longus \ncapitis, and verticalis, to maintain flexion in the cervical and upper thoracic \nspine.\nLegs: Same as salamba sarvangasana.\nShoulders: Rhomboids, to adduct the scapulae; serratus anterior, to upwardly \nrotate the scapulae (modulated by rhomboids to maintain the adduction of \nthe scapulae); levator scapulae, to elevate the scapulae (in this case, press \nthe scapulae into the floor); trapezius, to adduct and elevate the scapulae.\n149\nArms: Infraspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; biceps brachii and anterior deltoids, to flex the arms (the arm \nposition is neutral, but the action is that of flexion against the weight of \ngravity); triceps, to extend the elbows.\nObstacles and Notes\nIn this pose, the scapulae are adducted and slightly upwardly rotated; without \nthe levering action of the arms, this calls on the muscles that move the scapulae \non the rib cage to work strongly, in what can be thought of as a contradictory \naction. If the scapulae are not maintained in adduction, the weight of the body \nfalls into the spine; if the scapulae do not upwardly rotate, the arms are chal-\nlenged in reaching to the knees. The scapulae are positioned in neutral rotation \nas they extend to the knees, but the action that gets them there is upward rota-\ntion, as they come from the downward rotation of sarvangasana.\nThe upper fibers of the psoas major and abdominal muscles are very strongly \nengaged here to maintain the spinal flexion in the thoracic spine. In addition, \nmore lumbar flexion occurs to bring the legs farther overhead and counterbal-\nance the pull of gravity. Reducing this tendency toward lumbar flexion makes the \nspinal flexors work much harder eccentrically—against the body weight’s ten-\ndency to roll down to the floor.\nIn this balancing act between spinal flexors and extensors, imbalances that \nare usually imperceptible show up, because the arms aren’t available to lever-\nage symmetry. When these torques appear, they make this pose that much more \nchallenging to balance.\nBreathing\nIn niralamba sarvangasana, the intense action in the full-body’s flexor and exten-\nsor groups creates quite a challenge to the shape change of breathing. Because \nthis is a challenging balance pose that requires a lot of stabilizing action in the \nabdominal and thoracic musculature, any attempt at deep breathing will destabi-\nlize the pose even as the full-body activation of these major muscle groups cre-\nates a demand for significant oxygenation.\nEfficiency—finding the minimum amount of effort necessary to maintain the \nposition—allows the limited breath movements to supply just enough energy to \nsustain the pose.\n150\nSetu Bandhasana\nBridge Pose\nSET-too BAHN-dahs-anna\nsetu = dam, dike, or bridge\nbandha = lock\nsetubandha = the forming of a causeway or bridge, a dam, or bridge\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine inversion\nJoint Actions\nSpine cervical and upper thoracic flexion; lower thoracic and lumbar exten-\nsion; sacrum counternutation; hip extension, adduction, and internal rota-\ntion; knee flexion; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula adduction, downward rota-\ntion, elevation; glenohumeral joint external rotation, extension, adduction; \nelbow flexion; forearm supination; wrist extension (dorsiflexion).\nWorking\nSpine: Spinal extensors, especially in the mid- and lower thoracic; psoas minor \nand abdominal muscles, eccentrically, to prevent overextension in the \nlumbar spine.\nLegs: Hamstrings, to extend the hips and flex the knees, especially the medial \nhamstrings to adduct and extend the hips; adductor magnus, to extend, \ninternally rotate, and adduct the hips; medial fibers of gluteus maximus, \nto help extend the hip; tibialis anterior, to dorsiflex the ankle and pull the \nknees forward; vastii, to extend the knees.\nRectus \nabdominis\nQuadriceps\nHamstrings\nGluteus \nmaximus\n151\nShoulders: Rhomboids, to adduct the scapulae; levator scapulae, to elevate \nthe scapulae (in this case, press the scapulae into the floor) and medially \nrotate the bottom tips of the scapulae (which tips the glenoid fossa down-\nward); trapezius, to adduct, elevate, and medially rotate the bottom tips of \nthe scapulae. The pectoralis minor is also active to downwardly rotate the \nscapulae (the more adduction of the scapulae, the less the pectoralis minor \ncan work).\nArms: Infraspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; subscapularis and coracobrachialis, eccentrically, to protect the \nfront of the joint from protraction; long head of triceps and teres major, to \nextend the shoulder and adduct the arm; posterior deltoid, to extend and \nexternally rotate the arm; biceps brachii and brachialis, to flex the elbow \nand supinate the forearm; flexor carpi radialis, ulnaris, and flexor digitorum \nsuperficialis and profundus, eccentrically, to support the weight of the hips.\nLengthening\nSpine: Psoas minor, rectus abdominis, obliques, anterior rib cage muscles.\nLegs: Rectus femoris, psoas major, and iliacus.\nShoulders: Serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, pectoralis major, pectoralis \nminor.\nArms: Flexors of the forearm and hand are working eccentrically, lengthening \nwhile holding the weight of the pelvis and legs.\nObstacles and Notes\nIt can be a challenge to get full hip extension in this pose. If the hamstrings and \nadductor magnus are not strong enough, the gluteus maximus may do too much \nand pull the legs into external rotation; or the other adductors will activate to \nbring the knees together but also flex the hips; or the rectus femoris will work to \nextend the knees, but won’t fully extend the hips.\nSpinal extensors, especially lumbar, may try to help, but too much lumbar \nextension is not helpful, because it will limit hip extension by putting tension on \nthe psoas complex.\nThe action in the arms is the same as for the shoulder stand and viparita \nkarani; the action in the hips and legs is the same as for lifting into urdhva dha-\nnurasana.\nAll in all, considering the many muscle actions that must be balanced for this \npose to work, sustaining this basic posture actually requires a high degree of \ncoordination.\nBreathing\nThe three bandhas can be active here, as in viparita karani. The main difference \nis that in bridge pose, mula bandha must be applied much more actively and \nagainst the lengthened resistance of the abdominal wall.\n152\nHalasana\nPlow Pose\nhah-LAHS-anna\nhala = plow\nSpinal \nextensors\nTriceps\nHamstrings\nGastrocnemius\nSoleus\nTrapezius\nTriceps\nClassification and Level\nBasic inverted supine forward bend\nJoint Actions\nSpine cervical flexion; thoracic flexion; lumbar flexion; sacroiliac joint nutation; \nhip flexion, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion; \ntoe extension; scapula adduction, downward rotation, elevation; glenohu-\nmeral joint external rotation, extension, adduction; elbow extension; fore-\narm pronation; wrist extension; finger and hand flexion to clasp hands.\nWorking\nSpine: Similar to sarvangasana, but more active in the intrinsic spinal muscles \nto keep the spine lengthened.\n153\nWorking eccentrically in the neck: rectus capitis posterior major and minor, \nobliquus capitis superior and inferior.\nLegs: Gravity, to flex hips; adductor magnus, gracilis, and pectineus, to main-\ntain internal rotation and adduction against the pull of the gluteal muscles; \nvastii, to extend the knees; tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum, and exten-\nsor hallucis, to extend the toes.\nShoulders: Similar to sarvangasana, but working more strongly against the \nweight of the legs in hip flexion.\nArms: Infraspinatus and teres minor to externally rotate the head of the \nhumerus; subscapularis and coracobrachialis, eccentrically, to protect the \nfront of the shoulder joint from protraction; long head of triceps and teres \nmajor to extend the shoulder and adduct the arm; posterior deltoid, to \nextend and externally rotate the arm; triceps, to extend the elbow; prona-\ntors in forearm; flexor carpi radialis, ulnaris, and flexor digitorum superfi-\ncialis and profundus, to clasp hands.\nLengthening\nSpine: Spinal extensors through whole spine.\nLegs: Gluteus maximus, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus.\nShoulders: Serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, pectoralis major, pectoralis minor.\nObstacles and Notes\nThere are many variations of this pose, some of which have a reputation for \nbeing more risky than others. For example, consider the variation of extending \nthe arms overhead and clasping the toes. As in karnapidasana and nirlamba sar-\nvangasana, this upwardly rotates the scapulae and makes the adduction of the \nscapulae difficult to maintain—the rhomboids and trapezius then lengthen, and \nweight falls into the upper spine. This variation can overstretch the thoracic and \ncervical spine, as there is potentially damaging pressure from the pushing action \nof the feet and, if the hamstrings and gluteals are tight, from the limited hip flex-\nion forcing greater spinal flexion.\nBecause this pose can produce very intense flexion for the spine, especially the \ncervical region, it’s more important to maintain the integrity of the scapulae and \ncervical and thoracic spine than to get the legs to the floor—support the legs, if \nnecessary, to protect the neck.\nBreathing\nAs in the shoulder stand, keeping the base of the rib cage open allows the dia-\nphragm and abdominal viscera to shift effectively toward the head, so the full \nbenefits of inversion can occur. This can be much more of a challenge in this \npose, because the hip flexion tends to create more intra-abdominal pressure.\nHalasana is a very good gauge of how freely you can breathe. It’s one thing to \nhave the muscular flexibility to get into the pose, but quite another to have the \ndiaphragm and organs be free enough to remain there and breathe comfortably.\n154\nKarnapidasana\nEar-to-Knee Pose\nkarna-peed-AHS-anna\nkarna = ear\npidana = squeeze, pressure\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate inverted forward bend\nJoint Actions\nSpinal flexion, hip and knee flexion, scapula abduction and upward rotation, \narm flexion, elbow flexion.\nWorking\nGravity.

Otherwise, the weight of the \nlegs and pelvis can put too much pressure and forced lengthening into the \nvulnerable muscles of the neck and upper back.\nArms: The rhomboids and trapezius are lengthened here by the abduction of \nthe scapulae and the pressure of the lower body into the upper back.\nObstacles and Notes\nThis counterposes the shoulder action of sarvangasana because the spinal exten-\nsion and scapular adduction of shoulder stand is reversed, so the muscles that \nwere active are now lengthening. If the release is too passive, however, the mus-\ncles can be overstretched.\nThe support shifts in this pose to the spinous processes of the thoracic spine \nfrom the scapulae and trapezius.\nBreathing\nIn ear-to-knee pose, the weight of the lower body is bearing down into the \ntorso, which is in maximal flexion—this is basically, an inverted, weight-bearing \nexhalation.\nThe restriction that this position imposes on the breath shouldn’t be a problem \nas long as the body is flexible enough to be in repose. If the muscles are tense, \nthe limited capacity to breathe will soon result in the muscles’ inability to fuel \ntheir activity; at this point, the asana should be exited.\nIliocostalis\nLongissimus\nSpinalis\nRhomboids\n156\nJathara Parivrtti\nBelly Twist\nJAT-hara pari-VRIT-ti\njathara = stomach, belly, abdomen, bowels, or the interior of anything\nparivrtti = turning, rolling\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine twist\nJoint Actions\nAxial rotation of the spine, hip flexion, knee flexion, scapula resting on rib \ncage, external rotation in far arm, internal rotation in near arm.\nWorking\nMostly gravity.

This \nis incorrect, however, because the lumbar spine is extremely limited in axial rotation (5 \ndegrees total). The first joint above the sacrum that is capable of significant twisting is \nT11-T12, and that is where the opposition of the rib cage to the pelvis begins.\nTo ensure that this twist is evenly distributed throughout the spine, it is important \nto maintain a neutral spine. This is a challenge with both knees bent, because it’s \nmuch easier to move into lumbar flexion to deepen the rotation. However, this puts \npressure into the lumbar vertebrae and discs, as well as loading the T11-T12 disc. \nAnother challenge to the neutral spine is that tightness in the lateral line will pull \nthe spine into extension, lifting the far shoulder off the floor and compressing the \nbrachial plexus. This often results in sensations of numbness or tingling in the arm.\nBreathing\nBecause the body is supported by the floor, and the main action is provided by gravity, \nthe breathing and postural muscles are free to release in jathara parivrtti. The breath can \nthus be directed in various ways to achieve specific effects. Bringing the breath move-\nments to the abdomen, for example, will release the tone in the abdominal wall and \npelvic floor and assist in reducing extraneous muscle tension in the lumbar region. The \nopposite pattern of restraining the abdominal wall during the inhalation (mula bandha) \nwill direct the action of the diaphragm into the thoracic structures, mobilizing the costo-\nvertebral joints. A similar effect can be achieved in the seated twists (see the discussion of \nardha matsyendrasana in chapter 5).\nGluteus \nmaximus\nPectoralis \nmajor\nHamstrings\nPiriformis\nMultifidi\nErector \nspinae\nVariation\nBelly Twist With Legs Extended\nTop leg hamstrings are lengthening. Tightness there can \ncontribute to spinal flexion. The bottom leg’s hamstrings \nare active and help counter spinal flexion with extensor \naction.\nWith the bottom leg extended, there is more adduc-\ntion of the top leg and possibly more internal rotation, \nwhich leads to increased length in the iliotibial band; \ngluteus minimus, medius, and maximus; piriformis; \ngemelli; and obturator internus.\n158\nMatsyasana\nFish Pose\nmots-YAHS-anna\nmatsya = fish\nClassification and Level\nBasic supine backbend\nJoint Actions\nSpine extension; mild hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation; knee exten-\nsion; scapula downward rotation, adduction; glenohumeral joint extension, \nadduction, internal rotation; elbow flexion; forearm pronation.\nWorking\nSpine: Spinal extensors, psoas major (especially lower fibers).\nLegs: Psoas major, iliacus, pectineus, tensor fascia latae; hamstrings, to \nground legs; quadriceps, for hip flexion and knee extension.\nArms: Shoulder joint: subscapularis, to internally rotate; teres major, to inter-\nnally rotate; latissimus dorsi, to internally rotate and extend; triceps long \nhead, to extend the shoulder. Trapezius and rhomboids adduct the scapu-\nlae; pronators in the forearm turn the hands toward the floor.\nLengthening\nAnterior neck muscles; anterior rib cage expands (internal intercostals); the \nabdominal muscles lengthen, but work eccentrically to resist the anterior \ndisplacement of the organs caused by the psoas pushing them forward; \nin the arms, coracobrachialis and pectorals lengthen, along with the long \nhead of the biceps, serratus anterior, and anterior deltoids.\nObstacles and Notes\nThis pose can be done while focusing on using spinal extensors (which include \nthe psoas major on the front of the spine) or supported on the elbows. If the \nSternocleidomastoid\nRectus abdominis\n159\nsupport of the elbows is used, there is less work in the muscles of the torso and \nperhaps more ease in breathing and more expansion.\nIf the pose is done while focusing on the muscles that extend the spine, the \nneck will be better protected when lifting the arms off the floor. Variations can \nalso be done with blocks under the spine, and with the feet in baddha konasana \n(see chapter 5) or padmasana.\nThis pose is a great demonstration of the role of the psoas major in both hip \nflexion and spinal extension.\nFish pose is frequently used as an immediate counterpose to the shoulder \nstand because it reverses the position of the cervical spine from extreme flexion \nto extreme extension. However, going from one static extreme to the other may \nnot be the most beneficial way to compensate for the stresses of the shoulder \nstand. A more therapeutic approach would be to gradually reverse the move-\nment of the neck with simple vinyasas leading up to cobra pose (bhujangasana; \nsee chapter 8).\nBreathing\nIn fish pose, the chest is expanded, but not as maximally as in the more difficult \narm-supported urdhva dhanurasana. As a result, there is still room for the inhal-\ning action to further expand the rib cage, using the arms as leverage.\nVariation\nFish Pose With Arms and Legs Lifted\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension; hip flex-\nion, adduction, internal \nrotation; knee exten-\nsion; scapula upward \nrotation, abduction; \nglenohumeral joint flex-\nion, adduction, external \nrotation; and elbow \nextension.\nWorking\nLegs: Greatly increased action in the legs when lifted off the floor—especially \nthe psoas major, iliacus, and rectus femoris.\nArms: With the change in arm position, the coracobrachialis, no longer \nlengthening, is now working to flex and adduct the arm; as are the pecto-\nrals and anterior deltoids. The serratus anterior is recruited to abduct the \nscapulae, and the triceps are extending the elbow.\nFor a more calming effect—particularly if using the matsyasana as a counter-\npose—a focus on gentle abdominal breathing can be quite useful.\nMatsyasana with arms and legs lifted.\nSpinal extensors\nRectus \nabdominis\nTriceps\nDeltoid\nSternocleidomastoid\nPsoas major\nQuadriceps\n160\nAnantasana\nReclining Vishnu Couch Pose\nanan-TAHS-anna\nananta = endless, eternal (anta = end, an = without)\nAnanta is also the name given to the mythical serpent that the god Vishnu \nreclines on like a couch.\nClassification and Level\nEasy side-lying pose\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral curves, lateral flexion.

The \nchallenge is to find the counteraction deep in the pelvis rather than through \nrotating the spine. The gluteus maximus and rotators can be used in the bottom \nleg to stabilize the pelvic half only if that bottom leg is well grounded.\nBreathing\nAnantasana is one of the few true side-lying poses. In side lying, the dome of \nthe diaphragm closest to the floor moves cranially (toward the head), while the \nother dome moves caudally (toward the tail). This is due mainly to the effect of \ngravity on the abdominal organs, which are pulled toward the floor, taking the \ndiaphragm with them. In addition, the lung closest to the floor (the dependent \nlung) becomes more supported, and its tissue becomes more compliant, meaning \nthat it’s under less mechanical tension and responds more easily to the action of \nthe diaphragm.\nConsciously creating this asymmetry in the respiratory mechanism can be \nuseful in breaking up deeply ingrained breathing habits. For example, this pose \ncan be beneficial to people trying to change the habit of sleeping on only one \nside of the body.\n163\nprone poses\n163\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n8\nP\nrone means lying in a facedown position. Moving into postures from a prone position \nengages the posterior musculature of the body, which is why many back-strengthening \nexercises start in this position.\nBecause of the pressure that the prone position puts on the spinal curves, particularly \nthe cervical region, it is not comfortable to remain prone for extended periods of time, and \nit is not a recommended sleeping position for this reason.\nThere are only a few backward-bending poses that begin in the prone position, and they \nare usually counterposed by entering into the kneeling pose of the child.\nSocially, this position has even more of a connotation of surrender than kneeling. In \nmany religious traditions, placing the entire front surface of the body on the floor is known \nas a full prostration.\n164\nBhujangasana\nCobra Pose\nboo-jang-GAHS-anna\nbhujanga = serpent\n(bhuja = arm or shoulder + anga = limb)\nClassification and Level\nBasic prone backbending pose\nJoint Actions\nSpine extension; sacrum counternutation; hip extension, internal rotation, \nadduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; scapula neutral (possibly \nupward rotation); glenohumeral joint external rotation; elbow extension; \nforearm pronation.\nSerratus \nanterior\nTriceps\nHamstrings\nGluteus maximus\n165\nWorking\nSpine: The entire spinal extensor group—intertransversarii, interspinalis, rota-\ntores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius capitis and cervicis, longis-\nsimus, iliocostalis—work concentrically to create extension. In addition, \nthere is strong action in the serratus posterior superior, which assists chest \nexpansion and synergizes the action of the erectors, which it overlays.

The \nhamstrings, especially semitendinosus and semimembranosus, extend the \nhips and maintain adduction and internal rotation. The extensor portion of \nthe adductor magnus, along with the deep and medial fibers of the glu-\nteus maximus, also extend the hips without externally rotating the legs. \nThe vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius work to extend the knees. \nWeakness in the medial hamstrings can cause the gluteus maximus to do \nmore than its share of hip extension, in which case the legs will externally \nrotate, abduct, or both.\nLengthening\nSpine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, external intercostals, longus colli and capi-\ntis, suprahyoid, infrahyoid, scalenes, anterior longitudinal ligament.\nArms: Latissimus dorsi, teres major, pectoralis major and minor, biceps, and \nsupinators.\nLegs: Rectus femoris, lower fibers of psoas and iliacus, and tensor fascia latae.\nObstacles and Notes\nIt is important to find the deeper intrinsic back muscles to do the action of spinal \nextension in this pose. Using the latissimus dorsi and other more superficial mus-\ncles will affect the scapulae and rib cage and interfere with breathing by inhibit-\ning the movement of the ribs.\nIn cobra, the serratus anterior is active to maintain a neutral position of the \nscapulae against the push of the arms. When the arms push, the shoulders don’t \nelevate, but the spine is lifted.\nThe latissimus dorsi are not helpful as extensors of the spine, because they \ncreate flexion of the upper back and internal rotation in the arms.\nWeakness in the pronators of the forearm, or tightness in the supinators (or \ninterosseus membrane), will make the elbows flare out to the side and will affect \nboth the elbow and shoulder joints. The forearms should stay parallel to each \nother for the best alignment of action through the arms into the spine.\n(continued)\n166\nBreathing\nAlthough the standard instruction is to inhale while entering into a backbend, \nit can be very helpful to enter into this basic backbend on an exhalation. For \nmany people who are locked into a “belly breathing” pattern, their inhalation \nwill actually restrict thoracic extension and rib cage expansion (this is because a \nbelly breath is accomplished by restricting rib movement while the diaphragm \ncontracts).\nBhujangasana  (continued)\nSpinal extensors\nExternal obliques\n167\nCobra variation with knees flexed.\nGluteus \nmaximus\nHamstrings\nQuadriceps\nVariation\nCobra With Knees Flexed\nIn this position, the hamstrings are used for both actions: hip extension and \nknee flexion. This position of the leg puts the hamstrings at a very short working \nlength, which greatly increases the chances of cramping in the muscles.\nThis position also makes it more likely that the outer fibers of the gluteus max-\nimus will fire to help with the hip extension, which will also externally rotate and \nabduct the legs. Often, a student who can keep the legs adducted and parallel \nwhen the knees are extended will find it much more challenging when the knees \nare flexed. In this position, all of the quadriceps are lengthened, and the stretch \nin the rectus femoris can restrict the range of motion in knee flexion, too.\n168\nDhanurasana\nBow Pose\ndon-your-AHS-anna\ndhanu = bow\nClassification and Level\nBasic or intermediate prone backbend\nJoint Actions\nSpine extension; sacrum counternutation; hip extension, medial rotation, \nadduction; knee flexion; ankle plantarflexion; scapula adduction, elevation; \nglenohumeral joint medial rotation, extension, adduction; elbow extension; \nforearm pronation; finger and hand flexion.\nDeltoids\nPectoralis \nmajor\nGluteus \nmaximus\nAdductor magnus\nSemimembranosus\nSemitendinosus\n169\nWorking\nArms: Working to stabilize arm and scapula position are the subscapularis, \nteres major, posterior deltoids, rhomboids, levator scapulae, and triceps. \nEccentrically working in the opposite direction as they lengthen are the \npectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, anterior deltoids, and serratus \nanterior.\nLegs: Working to extend the hip joints are the hamstrings, especially semiten-\ndinosus and semimembranosus, the extensor portion of adductor magnus, \nand the deep and medial fibers of gluteus maximus. The vastus lateralis, \nmedialis, and intermedius, and the lower part of the rectus femoris are \nworking to extend the knees.\nLengthening\nLegs: Because of hip extension, the rectus femoris, the lower fibers of the \npsoas, the iliacus, and possibly the pectineus and tensor fascia latae.\nNotes\nThe front of the shoulder joint is structurally vulnerable in this position. If the \nscapulae are not mobilized in the direction of the stretch (adduction, elevation), \ntoo much pressure could be put into the anterior glenohumeral joint, resulting in \nan overstretch of the subscapularis or damage to the joint capsule. Because this is \na bound pose, the pressure into these vulnerable joints is greater.\nThis pose can be “worked” in a variety of ways by emphasizing different \nactions: by deepening the action in the spine, by increasing hip extension, or by \nusing knee extension to deepen spine and hip extension. The balance of actions \nin the hip and knee will be affected depending on whether the hamstrings or \nthe quadriceps are more activated. Because this is a bound pose, with the hands \ngrasping the ankles, it is possible to put too much pressure into the knees. Thus, \nthe alignment of the leg at the hip and the activation of the feet are important to \nmaintain the integrity of the knee.\nBreathing\nIt is a common practice to rock back and forth in this pose by pushing the belly \ninto the floor with each inhalation. It is less common (but much more intense) to \npractice not rocking by directing the inhalation into the already expanded chest \nregion.\nFlexor carpi radialis\nPalmaris longus\nFlexor carpi ulnaris\nPronator teres\n170\nSalabhasana\nLocust Pose\nsha-la-BAHS-anna\nsalabha = grasshopper, locust\nClassification and Level\nBasic symmetrical backward bend (although there are asymmetric variations)\nJoint Actions\nSpine extension; sacrum counternutation; hip extension, medial rotation, \nadduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; scapula upward rotation, \nelevation, abduction; glenohumeral joint external rotation, flexion; elbow \nextension; forearm neutral; wrist neutral.\nWorking\nArms: Working to lift the arms are the supraspinatus, long head of the biceps \nbrachii, triceps, anterior and medial deltoids, serratus anterior, and the  \ntrapezius.\nSpine: Working to extend the spine are the spinal extensor group: intertrans-\nversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius \ncapitis and cervicis, longissimus, iliocostalis.\nLegs: Working to extend the hips are the hamstrings (semimembranosus, \nsemitendinosus, and biceps femoris) and the deep, medial fibers of gluteus \nmaximus. The adductor magnus are active to keep the knees together, and \nkeeping the knees extended are the vastus lateralis, medialis, and interme-\ndius.

If the latissimus dorsi are used to extend the spine (rather than the \ndeeper, intrinsic spinal muscles), they will inhibit the movement in the arms.\nThis position of the legs uses a complex interaction among adductors, medial \nrotators, and hip extensors. This is because many of the muscle actions that lift \nand support the body in this position create other actions that must be neu-\ntralized by opposing or synergistic muscles. For example, because the gluteus \nmaximus, a powerful hip extensor, also externally rotates the legs, it’s preferable \nto use the hamstrings for hip extension. Additionally, the gluteus medius and \nminimus, which help with internal rotation, also happen to abduct the leg, so the \nadductors will kick in to keep the legs together. Therefore, there are always lots \nof synergistic actions going on. People will have different priorities, or challenges, \ndepending on where they start and their preexisting patterns of strength/weak-\nness and flexibility/tightness.\nBreathing\nTo rock, or not to rock? All the weight of the body is brought to bear on the \nabdomen in this variation of locust. While holding the pose for several breaths, \nthe body will rock back and forth with the action of the diaphragm if the primary \nbreathing pattern is “belly breath.” An interesting challenge is to keep from rock-\ning, which necessitates a release in the thoracic structures and diaphragm, allow-\ning the floor to push into the abdomen, rather than the abdomen pushing into \nthe floor.\n172\nViparita Salabhasana\nFull Locust Pose\nvip-par-ee-tah sha-la-BAHS-anna\nviparita = reversed, inverted\nsalabha = grasshopper, locust\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced symmetrical backward bend\nJoint Actions\nSpine extension, sacrum counternutation; hip extension, medial rotation, \nadduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; scapula downward rota-\ntion, elevation, abduction; glenohumeral joint external rotation, flexion, \nadduction; elbow extension; forearm neutral; wrist neutral.\nQuadriceps\nExternal obliques\nRectus abdominis\nSternocleidomastoid\n173\nEntering Pose:\nWorking\nConcentrically: hamstrings, gluteus maxi-\nmus, spinal extensors, flexors of gleno-\nhumeral joint (pectoralis major, anterior \ndeltoid, biceps, coracobrachialis, serratus \nanterior). Eccentrically: subscapularis, to \nprotect the glenohumeral joint.\nRemaining in Pose:\nWorking and Lengthening\nEccentrically: vastii, obliques, rectus abdominis, and anterior neck muscles \n(longus colli, longus capitis, rectus capitis anterior, suprahyoid, infrahyoid, \nscalenes, sternocleidomastoid), thoracic diaphragm.\nNotes\nFrom the previous analysis of muscular actions, it’s clear that what it takes to get \ninto this pose is almost completely the opposite of what it takes to remain in it. \nLifting the weight of the body into spinal extension requires a strong, integrated \naction of the arms and spinal extensors. Once past vertical, gravity will pull the \nweight of the body into extension, so the trunk flexors must kick in to prevent \nhyperextension. Therefore, based on their balance of strength and flexibility in \nthe extensor and flexor muscle groups, some people may have the ability to get \ninto full locust, but not to sustain it; whereas others can’t get there themselves, \nbut can stay there if assisted into the pose.\nBreathing\nThe standard instruction to inhale while entering into a backbend can be coun-\nterproductive here. This is because a strong contraction of the diaphragm will \ndraw the base of the rib cage and lumbar spine (the diaphragm’s origin) toward \nthe central tendon (its insertion). This can create considerable resistance to the \nlengthening in the deep front line of the body. Exhaling while lifting the body \ninto the pose works better for many people.\nRemaining in the pose requires the abdominal wall to remain tautly active, \nwhich can limit abdominal breath movement, while the actions that synergize \nthe push of the arms into the floor tend to limit thoracic excursion. In addition, \nhaving the neck in weight-bearing extension can add resistance to the airway, \nnot to mention that all of this is happening in an inverted position. All in all, this \nis a very challenging position to breathe in. Efficiency of effort is the key.\nAnterior neck muscles.\nBase of skull\nMandible\nT.M.J.\nRectus \ncapitis \nanterior\nLongus colli\n175\narm support poses\n175\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n9\nI\nn spite of their obvious similarities, the upper and lower extremities of the human body \nhave evolved to perform specific functions. The structure of the foot, knee, hip, and pelvis \npoints to their function of support and locomotion.\nThe highly mobile structures of the hand, elbow, and shoulder girdle are clearly ill-suited \nto weight bearing. In fact, if you compare the proportional structure of the hand and foot, \nyou will see a completely inverse relationship between the weight-bearing and articular \nstructures within them.\nIn the foot, the heavy, dense tarsal bones comprise half the length of its structure. Adding \nto this the weight-bearing function of the metatarsals, it can be said that four fifths of the \nfoot’s structure is dedicated to weight bearing. The foot’s phalangeal structures contribute \nonly one fifth of its total length.\nThese proportions are completely reversed in the hand, where half the length of the \nstructure is composed of the highly mobile phalangeal bones. The hand’s metacarpals are \nalso very mobile (compared to the metatarsals), whereas the relatively immobile carpals \n(wrist bones) comprise only one fifth of the total length of the hand. This means that, even \nif you effectively recruit the metacarpals in arm support, you still have only half the length \nof the hand available for weight bearing.\nThe bottom line is that when you use the hand in weight-bearing poses, you have to \nrespect the fact that it is at a structural disadvantage. You must therefore compensate for \nthis fact when you prepare for and execute such poses.\nIn modern Western culture, many people overuse and misuse their arms and hands \nwhile working at computers. This is why all the arm supports in this book are categorized as \nintermediate or advanced; beginning students don’t put weight on their hands until they’ve \nfully experienced standing on their feet.\n176\nAdho Mukha Svanasana\nDownward-Facing Dog Pose\nAH-doh MOO-kah shvah-NAHS-anna\nadho mukha = having the face downward\nshvana = dog\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate inverted arm support\nJoint Actions\nThere are many approaches to working with this pose. Fundamentally, it is a \ngreat opportunity to observe the effects of the arms and legs on the spine.\nAssuming the spine is in neutral, or axial extension, then you move toward \nflexion in both the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint and the hip joint and \ntoward extension in the elbow and knee.\nSpine neutral or axial extension; scapula upward rotation and elevation, ini-\ntially abducted, but advanced students move toward adduction; glenohu-\nmeral joint flexion and external rotation; elbow extension; forearm prona-\ntion and wrist extension; sacrum nutation; hip flexion (with perhaps some \ninternal rotation); knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion.\nGastrocnemius\nHamstrings\nGluteus maximus\nLatissimus dorsi\nDeltoid\nRectus \nfemoris\nSerratus \nanterior\nTriceps\n177\nWorking\nSpine: Psoas minor, obliques; deep extensors work very precisely to maintain \nneutral spinal alignment (axial extension).\nLegs: Working against gravity. If the hamstrings are tight, the hip flexors (ilia-\ncus, rectus femoris, pectineus) may activate to assist with hip flexion, but \nthis is not actually desirable. The adductor magnus internally rotates and \nmoves the femur back. To extend the knee, the vastii and articularis genus \nactivate. To deepen the dorsiflexion in the ankle, the intrinsic foot muscles \nneed to maintain the integrity of the arches of the foot, so the extrinsic \nmuscles can release in the ankle.\nArms: Also working against gravity. The serratus anterior upwardly rotates \nand abducts the scapulae, while the infraspinatus, teres minor, and pos-\nterior deltoids work to externally rotate the glenohumeral joints. Because \nthe flexion of the glenohumeral joints is created by gravity, the anterior \ndeltoids can relax.\nTo extend the elbow and resist collapse in the shoulder, the triceps are active. \nThe latissimus dorsi often try to help this action, but they depress and internally \nrotate the shoulder, which creates impingement at the acromion process.\nThe pronators are active in the forearm, but if there is lack of rotation between \nthe radius and ulna, this can translate into overarticulation in the elbow or wrist, \nor internal rotation of the arm at the shoulder joint—all common sites of injury \nfor practitioners of vinyasa styles of yoga that employ repetitive downward-\nfacing dogs in sun salutations.\nAs in the foot and leg, the intrinsic action in the hand is essential for the inte-\ngration of the whole arm. Essentially, the hand must act as much as a foot as \npossible by maintaining its arch. The flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris should acti-\nvate to resist the collapse of the hand.\nLengthening\nSpine: Diaphragm, intercostals.\nLegs: Hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, gluteus maximus. Release is needed \nin the psoas major, iliacus, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, tensor fascia \nlatae, and pectineus.\nArms: Latissimus dorsi and teres major are lengthening. The long head of the \ntriceps is working eccentrically (at length).\nBreathing\nFrom the perspective of the breath, downward-facing dog is an inversion with \nthe spine in axial extension. Because inversions naturally move the diaphragm \ncranially, the exhaling action of the abdominal muscles can be quite deep. If \nthe lower abdominal action is maintained when initiating the inhalation (mula \nbandha), the thoracic structures will be encouraged to mobilize, which can be \nquite challenging in an arm support pose.\n178\nInfraspinatus\nTriceps\nSpinal extensors\nGluteus maximus\nHamstrings\nVastus lateralis\nPlatysma\nAdductor \nmagnus\nPectineus\nIliacus\nPsoas major\nDiaphragm\nJoint Actions\nFull spinal extension; sacroiliac counternutation; hip extension, internal rota-\ntion, and adduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; toe extension; \nscapula adduction, upward rotation; glenohumeral joint extension, neutral \nrotation (to maintain neutral shoulder alignment, some people need to \ninternally rotate and some people need to externally rotate the humerus); \nelbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist extension; finger extension.\nWorking\nSpine: Throughout the spine, the extensors are active, though mostly in the \nthoracic spine. Gravity creates much of the extension in the lumbar spine, \nso the psoas minor is active eccentrically to resist too much lumbar lordosis, \nand the obliques do the same. In the cervical spine, gravity, acting on the \nweight of the head, creates extension, so the anterior neck muscles work \nUrdhva Mukha Svanasana\nUpward-Facing Dog Pose\nOORD-vah MOO-kah shvon-AHS-anna\nurdhva = rising or tending upward, raised, elevated\nmukha = face\nshvana = dog\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate backbending arm \nsupport\n179\neccentrically to keep the action balanced. In the thoracic spine, the semispi-\nnalis thoracis, the spinalis thoracis, the thoracic part of the interspinalis, and \nthe rotatores are most active in deepening the thoracic extension.\nLegs: To extend the hips, the hamstrings work along with the extensor por-\ntion of the gluteus maximus. The adductor magnus internally rotates, \nextends, and adducts the hip joints, and the gracilis helps with adduction. \nThe vastii and articularis genus work to extend the knees.\nArms: The serratus anterior upwardly rotates the scapulae in synergy with the \nrhomboids and trapezius, which adduct the shoulder blades. The rotator \ncuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor) act \nto keep the humerus in neutral alignment, while the posterior deltoids and \ntriceps extend the shoulders and elbows. The pronators in the forearms \nand the intrinsic muscles of the hand distribute pressure through the whole \nhand to protect the heel of the hand and decrease pressure in the wrist.\nLengthening\nSpine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, psoas major, sternocleidomastoid, supra-\nhyoid, and infrahyoid.\nLegs: Rectus femoris, iliacus, and psoas major.\nArms: Biceps, pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, anterior deltoids, \nsubclavius.\nRib cage: Internal intercostals, transversus thoracis, serratus posterior inferior.\nObstacles and Notes\nIf the goal is to have extension distributed throughout the whole spine, there will \nneed to be more action in the thoracic region and less in the lumbar and cervi-\ncal regions. This translates into concentric work for the extensors in the thoracic \nspine and eccentric work for the flexors in the cervical and lumbar spines.\nThe latissimus dorsi are not so helpful in this pose, because they can fix the \nscapulae on the rib cage and inhibit extension in the thoracic spine. They also \nproduce internal rotation of the humerus and downward rotation of the scapu-\nlae, which oppose the actions of upward-facing dog.\nDepending on where restrictions are, the humerus can be pulled into either \ninternal or external rotation. Sometimes the external rotation that is active in \ndownward-facing dog needs to be modulated coming into upward-facing dog, \nbecause the whole hand–scapula relationship shifts relative to the spine.\nBreathing\nAs the counterpose to the “exhaled” downward-facing dog, this pose is clearly \nrelated to the expansive action of inhaling.\nMany who practice Ashtanga-based sequencing experience this pose only \nfor half a breath, as they move through it between chaturanga dandasana and \ndownward-facing dog. Holding it for several breaths allows the inhaling action \nto deepen the extension in the thoracic spine, whereas the exhaling action can \nassist in stabilizing the lumbar and cervical curves.\n180\nRectus \nabdominis\nTriceps\nPronators\nGluteus \nmaximus\nPsoas \nmajor\nSpinal \nextensors\nAdho Mukha Vrksasana\nDownward-Facing Tree Pose\nah-doh moo-kah vriks-SHAHS-anna\nadho mukha = face downward\nvrksa = tree\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced inverted arm support\nJoint Actions\nSpine cervical extension, slight thoracic and lumbar \nextension; neutral sacroiliac joints; hips neutral \nextension, adduction, and slight internal rotation; \nknee extension; ankle neutral (dorsi)flexion—as \nopposed to the gymnastic version, in which the \ntoes are pointed (plantarflexion); scapula upward \nrotation and abduction; glenohumeral joint flexion \nand external rotation; elbow extension; forearm \npronation; wrist dorsiflexion.\nArms: As in downward-facing dog, the serratus anterior creates upward rota-\ntion and stabilization of the scapulae on the rib cage. The deltoids flex the \nshoulder; the infraspinatus, teres minor, and posterior deltoids maintain \nexternal rotation in the glenohumeral joint. The triceps maintain extension \nof the elbows and the pronators rotate the forearms to balance the rotation \nof the humerus; flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris protect the carpal tunnel. \nThe intrinsic muscles of the hand work to maintain the hand’s arches.\nWorking\nLegs: Gravity tries to flex and abduct the \nhips, so to maintain neutral extension, \nthe hamstrings are active, along with the \nadductor magnus to maintain adduction, \ninternal rotation, and extension.\nThe iliacus and psoas major work to resist \nhyperextension in the lumbar spine from \nthe legs falling back. The abdominal \nmuscles are quite active, particularly the \ntransversus and obliques to stabilize the \nspine. The spinal extensors act to lift into \nthe pose, and to maintain balance once \nthere. The gluteus maximus also helps to \nlift the legs into the pose, but does not \nneed to be too active to maintain it.\n181\nObstacles and Notes\nIf the latissimus dorsi are tight, the flexion and upward rotation of the arms can \ncause hyperextension in the lumbar spine.\nHands and wrists alert: It’s very challenging to maintain the integrity of the \nhands with all the weight of the body balancing on them, but it’s essential in this \npose, because collapsing into the wrist or heel of the hand is quite dangerous for \nthe carpal tunnel and the nerves passing through it.\nOveruse of the gluteus maximus and latissimus dorsi can create more of a \nbanana-shaped pose, which is admittedly easier for balance and may feel more \nstable for many people. Doing a handstand with a neutral spine is far more chal-\nlenging and recruits more core muscular strength.\nFor hypermobile students, it is especially important to find the strength of \ndeep, intrinsic muscles, so that the pose doesn’t become rigid, but is both stable \nand fluid . . . available for breathing.\nBreathing\nHandstand is one of the most difficult poses in which to breathe effectively. The \ncombined action of the core supporting muscles, working to minimize shape \nchange in the spine, also minimizes the breath movements. Add to this the chal-\nlenges of balancing, inversion, and strong upper-body action, and breathing is \nlikely to be relegated to an afterthought at best.\nMany people instinctively hold their breath in handstand, partly out of fear, \nbut also because of a need to stabilize the movements of the spine. Of course, to \nmaintain this balance for more than a few seconds, the breath must be integrated \ninto the pose—not necessarily as deep, full breaths, but as quick, efficient breaths \nthat don’t disrupt the balancing or stabilizing actions of the core musculature.\nSpinal \nextensors\nLatissimus dorsi\nTrapezius\nDeltoid\nGluteus \nmaximus\nExternal obliques\nTriceps\nFlexor \ncarpi \nradialis\n182\nChaturanga Dandasana\nFour-Limbed Stick Pose\nchaht-tour-ANG-ah don-DAHS-anna\nchatur = four\nanga = limb\ndanda = staff, stick\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate arm support in axial extension\nJoint Actions\nNeutral spine; neutral sacroiliac joint; hip adduction, internal rotation, neutral \nextension; knee flexion; ankle dorsiflexion; neutral scapula; neutral gleno-\nhumeral joint; elbow flexion; forearm pronation; wrist extension.\nSerratus \nanterior \nRectus \nabdominis\nTriceps\nSpinal \nextensors\nGluteus \nmaximus\nHamstrings\nGastrocnemius\nPectoralis \nmajor\nExternal \nobliques\nSerratus \nanterior\nRectus \nabdominis\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis \nVastus \nmedialis\n183\nWorking\nGravity.\nStabilizing spine: Obliques, rectus abdominis, psoas minor, eccentrically; \nspinal muscles, especially the cervical spine, concentrically.\nLegs: Hamstrings; adductor magnus; some gluteus maximus, concentrically; \npsoas major; iliacus; rectus femoris, eccentrically, for neutral hip extension; \nvastii and articularis genus, for knee extension; gastrocnemius and soleus \nmodulate tibialis anterior to create dorsiflexion; intrinsic and extrinsic foot \nmuscles.\nArms: Serratus anterior, eccentrically, to prevent winging of the scapula; rota-\ntor cuff (subscapularis to protect the front of the joint, mainly infraspinatus \nand teres minor to externally rotate the humerus against the pull of the \npectoralis and coracobrachialis); pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coraco-\nbrachialis, and triceps, eccentrically; pronators; intrinsic and extrinsic hand \nmuscles.\nNotes\nWeakness in the pose shows up in the lower body as lumbar hyperextension \ncombined with hip flexion. To counter this, the coordinated action of the ham-\nstrings is important.\nIn the upper body, weakness in the triceps and serratus anterior can show up \nas a downward rotation of the scapulae and an overuse of the pectoralis major \nand minor.\nDepressing the scapulae by recruiting the latisssimus dorsi can give a feeling \nof strength in the back, but it contributes to hyperextension of the lumbar spine \nand a downward rotation of the scapulae.\nBreathing\nMaintaining this position relative to gravity calls into play virtually all the respira-\ntory muscles, along with the arms and shoulder girdle. This degree of muscular \neffort produces a strong stabilizing effect on the movements of the diaphragm, \nwhich will operate against considerable resistance. Progress in this pose consists \nof making the muscular effort as efficient as possible, which will result in the abil-\nity to maintain both the alignment and smooth breathing for increasingly longer \nperiods of time.\n184\nAstavakrasana\nEight-Angle Pose\nah-SHTA-vak-RAHS-anna\nashta = eight  vakra = crooked, curved, bent\nAstavakra was a very learned sage \nwhose mother attended Vedic chanting \nclasses while pregnant.

It \nrequires the same action in the spine, although the spine is often slightly more \nextended (toward neutral) in astavakrasana, which allows for a more even distri-\nbution of the rotation through the spine.\nIn astavakrasana, the binding of the feet keeps the legs symmetrical. This \nsymmetry in the legs and hip joints means that the rotation has to happen more \nin the spine and less in the hip joints. With the wrapping of the legs around \nthe arm, less twist is needed than in parsva bakasana, because the bottom leg \ndoesn’t have to reach quite as far. In parsva bakasana, the legs can release asym-\nmetrically as the underneath leg slides forward, and the hip joints contribute to \nthe rotational action of the spine.\nAs in ardha matsyendrasana, if the spine does not rotate, potentially risky \ncompensatory twisting can occur through abduction or adduction of the scapulae \non the rib cage.\nAlso, the wrapping of the legs around the arms creates a fairly stable pivot \npoint. The challenge of this pose (if one can do parsva bakasana) is more about \nbalance and flexibility than strength. The extended legs in this pose make the \ncounterbalance on the support of the arms challenging.\nBreathing\nAs compared to side crane, in which the body weight is lifted and supported on \nthe upper arms, astavakrasana requires you to “hang” the weight of the lower \nbody off the support of the upper arm. It’s interesting to examine which pose \naffords easier breathing. Which pose requires more or less expenditure of energy, \nand which offers more freedom of movement for the diaphragm?\n186\nBakasana\nCrane Pose\nbak-AHS-anna\nbaka = crane, heron\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate arm balance\nPsoas major\nTrapezius\nSerratus anterior\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nCoracobrachialis\nBiceps \nbrachii\nTrapezius\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nSerratus \nanterior\nPectoralis \nmajor\nPsoas major\nIliacus\n187\nJoint Actions\nCervical extension of the spine; thoracic and lumbar flexion; sacrum joint \nnutation; hip flexion, external rotation, adduction; knee flexion; scapula \ndownward rotation, abduction; glenohumeral joint external rotation, flex-\nion, adduction; elbow flexion moving toward extension; forearm prona-\ntion; wrist dorsiflexion.\nWorking\nSpine: Maintaining spinal flexion are the psoas major and minor, abdominal \nmuscles, and pelvic floor. The deep intrinsic muscles in the posterior neck \nneed to find cervical extension while maintaining thoracic flexion, which is \na challenge because cervical extension tends to flatten the thoracic curve.\nLegs: The psoas and iliacus work to flex the hip joints. The pectineus, adduc-\ntor longus, and adductor brevis both adduct and flex the hip. The gracilis \nadducts and flexes the hip and knee, while the hamstrings maintain knee \nflexion.\nArms: The infraspinatus and teres minor externally rotate the humerus; the \nsubscapularis and supraspinatus protect the front of the shoulder joints. \nThe anterior deltoids, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major and minor \nabduct and downwardly rotate the scapulae. The serratus anterior abducts \nthe scapulae, and the triceps work against gravity to extend the elbow. \nThe flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, and the intrinsic muscles of the hand, \nmaintain the hand’s arches. The arms begin in flexion, but move toward \nextension against gravity when lifting into the pose.\nLengthening\nSpinal extensors, anterior neck muscles, rhomboids, trapezius.\nObstacles and Notes\nIn bird poses (eagle, crow, rooster, peacock), common factors are flexion of the \nthoracic spine, abduction of the scapulae, and extension of the cervical spine. In \nother words, wings are spread and the beak is lifted.\nThese actions require precision and strength in the muscles of the spine to \nachieve cervical extension without engaging the trapezius, which will interfere \nwith the action of the scapulae and arms.\nBreathing\nBecause the thoracic region is maintained in flexion, breath movements in the rib \ncage are minimized in crane pose. The lower abdomen is also stabilized some-\nwhat by the deep abdominal and hip flexor action, but the upper abdomen is \nrelatively free to move.\n(continued)\n188\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate twisting arm balance\nJoint Actions\nCervical extension of the spine; thoracic, lumbar, and sacral flexion and rota-\ntion; sacroiliac joint nutation; hip flexion, internal rotation, adduction; knee \nflexion (or extension); scapula downward rotation, abduction; glenohu-\nmeral joint external rotation, flexion, abduction; elbow flexion moving \ntoward extension; forearm pronation; wrist dorsiflexion.\nWorking\nSpinal flexion: Same as bakasana, but also with right internal obliques, left \nexternal obliques, right erector spinae, left rotatores, and multifidi to turn \nthe legs to the left and axially rotate the thoracic spine.\nLegs: Same as bakasana.\nArms: Same as bakasana, although the arms are abducted rather than \nadducted, to widen the base of the pose. It’s important to maintain exter-\nnal rotation of the glenohumeral joint, because the work is much more \nasymmetrical in this pose.\nBakasana  (continued)\nBakasana Variation\nParsva Bakasana\nparsh-vah bak-AHS-anna\nSide Crane Pose\nparsva = side\n189\nObstacles and Notes\nIf the knees separate in this pose, the rotation is happening more in the hip joints \nthan in the spine.\nIn the rotated pose, the arms are more abducted and the spine is more \nextended than in bakasana.\nBecause this is a bound pose, it can put a lot of force into the lower back when \nit is in a vulnerable position. That force comes not only from the knees on the \narm, but also from the weight of the body.\nBreathing\nSimilar as in bakasana, but even more restricted because of the twisting of the \nspine.\n190\nMayurasana\nPeacock Pose\nma-yur-AHS-anna\nmayura = peacock\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced extended arm balance\nJoint Actions\nCervical extension of the spine; mild thoracic flexion; mild lumbar extension; \nhip extension, adduction, internal rotation; knee extension; ankle plan-\ntarflexion; scapula downward rotation and abduction; glenohumeral joint \nexternal rotation, flexion, adduction; elbow flexion; forearm supination; \nwrist dorsiflexion.\nWorking\nSpine: Psoas major and minor and abdominal muscles resist the pressure of \nthe elbows into the viscera; pelvic floor muscles; deep intrinsic muscles in \nthe neck to find cervical extension while maintaining thoracic flexion; all \nspinal extensors (especially in the lumbar region, to help lift the legs).\nLegs: Hamstrings, to extend the hips; adductor magnus, to extend, internally \nrotate, and adduct; gluteus medius, minimus, and maximus, to help with \nextension.\nTriceps\nSpinal extensors\nGluteus maximus\n191\nArms: Infraspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the humerus; sub-\nscapularis and supraspinatus, to protect the front of the joint; anterior \ndeltoids, coracobrachialis, pectoralis major, and pectoralis minor, to abduct \nand downwardly rotate the scapulae; serratus anterior, to abduct the scap-\nulae; triceps, against gravity, to extend the elbow; extensor carpi radialis \nand ulnaris; intrinsic muscles of the hand.\nLengthening\nAnterior neck muscles, rhomboids, trapezius.\nObstacles and Notes\nAs in the other bird poses (eagle, crow, rooster), peacock involves flexion of the \nthoracic spine, abduction of the scapulae, and extension of the cervical spine. It’s \nunusual to balance on the arms with the forearms supinated. This changes the \naction in the wrist, because the extensors are more active to resist plantarflexion \n(falling into gravity).\nBreathing\nThe pressure of the elbows into the abdomen stimulates the organs. Many ben-\nefits have traditionally been ascribed to this effect. All the abdominal muscles \nproduce a strong isometric contraction to resist the pressure of the elbows into \nthe viscera. Although no hip flexion is involved in peacock, the psoas muscle also \nworks strongly from behind the peritoneum, to reduce the pressure on the ante-\nrior lumbar spine. So, the abdominal organs are being strongly squeezed from \nfront and back—as well as from above and below—by the respiratory and pelvic \ndiaphragms.\nConsidering how much muscular energy is expended to maintain this pose, \nand the minimal amount of breathing it permits, it’s no wonder that it is rarely \nheld for more than a few moments. The lungs in their limited capacity are simply \nunable to supply enough oxygen for that degree of muscular effort.\nA variation of mayurasana with legs in padmasana (lotus), is actually easier to \nmaintain. This is due to the reduced muscular effort of stabilizing the lower body \nand the necessary repositioning of the elbows into the upper abdomen. This \nposition takes less energy to stabilize than when the elbows press into the lower \nabdomen (which is the balance point when the legs are fully extended).\n192\nPincha Mayurasana\nFeathered Peacock Pose\npin-cha ma-yur-AHS-anna\npincha = a feather of a tail\nmayura = peacock\nRectus \nfemoris\nRectus \nabdominis\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nHamstrings\nGluteus \nmaximus\nPsoas\nSerratus anterior\nPronators\nClassification and Level\nAdvanced inverted arm support\nJoint Actions\nExtension is maintained throughout spine: The more extension there is in the \nthoracic spine, the less there will have to be in the cervical and lumbar \nspines. Neutral hip extension; knee extension; ankle neutral dorsiflexion; \nscapula abduction, upward rotation, and elevation; glenohumeral joint flex-\nion, external rotation, and adduction; elbow flexion; and forearm pronation.\nWorking\nSpine: Intrinsic muscles of the spine (intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, \nmultifidi); most spinal extensors (spinalis, semispinalis, longissimus dorsi, \niliocostalis). Psoas minor, obliques, rectus abdominis, and transversus \nAdductor \nlongus\nPectineus\nTriceps\nGracilis\nIliacus\nPsoas \nmajor\nDiaphragm\n193\nabdominis are very active eccentrically in the pose, to keep from falling \nbackward.\nLegs: Adductor magnus and hamstrings, to hold the legs together and extend \nthe hips; vastii, to extend the knees.\nArms: Serratus anterior, to abduct and upwardly rotate the scapulae; infra-\nspinatus and teres minor, to externally rotate the arms; subscapularis and \nsupraspinatus with infraspinatus and teres minor, to stabilize the humerus \nin the glenoid fossa; anterior deltoids, pectoralis major and coracobrachia-\nlis, to adduct and flex the arm; triceps, eccentrically, to resist the flexion \nof the elbows (and crashing into the face); pronators of the forearms, to \nbring the wrists flat on the floor.\nLengthening\nLatissimus dorsi, iliacus, rectus femoris, forearm supinators, abdominal mus-\ncles, internal intercostals (due to rib cage expansion and thoracic exten-\nsion), anterior neck muscles.\nObstacles and Notes\nIf the rotator cuff is active, the glenohumeral joint is stabilized, and the scapu-\nlae are more free to mobilize on the rib cage (with the serratus anterior), there \nwill also be more freedom in the thoracic spine to extend and in the rib cage to \nbreathe. Mobility in the thoracic spine is important; much like in upward-facing \ndog, the more extension there is in the thoracic spine, the less the lower back \nand cervical spine have to do.\nThe triceps and deltoids are eccentrically very active, to resist falling forward \nonto the face or head. This is a great preparation pose for handstand, because it \nstrengthens the arms.\nIf tightness in the forearm (either in the supinators or in the interosseus mem-\nbrane between the radius and the ulna) restricts full pronation, the elbows will \nswing open or the hands will come together. This common forearm issue is often \ninterpreted as tightness in the shoulders or weakness in the wrists.\nShortness in the latissimus dorsi can also pull the elbows wide, by internally \nrotating the humerus. This can feel like tight shoulders, but can actually be \naddressed by side bending and other actions that lengthen the latissimus dorsi. \nShortness in these muscles will also cause too much lumbar extension and inter-\nfere with breathing.\nBreathing\nThe base of support for this pose is formed by the forearms, rib cage, and tho-\nracic spine, and these structures need to be quite stable to maintain balance. \nBecause of this, excessive chest breathing interferes with supporting a forearm \nstand. On the other hand, the weight of the legs and pelvis and the curve of the \nlumbar spine need to be stabilized by the abdominal muscles, making too much \nabdominal movement counterproductive. Because of these factors, a breathing \npattern that moves equally and smoothly throughout the body is needed.\n194\nPurvottanasana\nUpward Plank Pose\nPOOR-vo-tan-AHS-ahna\npurva = front, east\nut = intense\ntan = extend, stretch\nClassification and Level\nBasic backbending arm support\nJoint Actions\nSpinal extension; sacroiliac counternutation; hip extension, internal rota-\ntion, and adduction; knee extension; ankle plantarflexion; toe extension; \nscapula adduction, downward rotation, elevation; glenohumeral joint \nextension, neutral rotation (some people need to internally rotate and \nsome people need to externally rotate their humerus to maintain neutral \nalignment); elbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist extension; finger \nextension.\nWorking\nSpine: Throughout the spine the extensors are active, although they are most \nactive in the thoracic spine. Gravity does much of the work of extension \nin the lumbar spine, so the psoas minor can be active eccentrically to resist \ntoo much lumbar lordosis. The obliques do the same.\nGastrocnemius\nHamstrings\nPsoas \nminor\nSpinal \nextensors\nTriceps\nInternal obliques\nPlatysma\n195\nIn the cervical spine, gravity creates the extension, and the anterior neck \nmuscles (longus capitis, longus colli, and so forth) can work eccentrically \nto keep the forces in the neck balanced. In the thoracic spine, semispinalis \nthoracis, spinalis thoracis, the thoracic part of interspinalis, and the rota-\ntores are the most active.\nLegs: To extend the hips, the hamstrings should be primary, perhaps assisted \nby the extensor portion of the gluteus maximus. The adductor magnus \ncreates internal rotation, extension, and adduction; the gracilis can help \nwith adduction. The vastii and articularis genus work to extend the knees; \nthe gastrocnemius and soleus plantarflex the ankle, while the intrinsic and \nextrinsic foot muscles extend the toes.\nArms: The teres major, posterior deltoids, and triceps work to extend the \nhumerus, with the rhomboids and trapezius acting to maintain adduction. \nThe rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres \nminor) act to keep the humerus in neutral alignment. The triceps extend \nthe elbows, while the pronators of the forearm and the intrinsic muscles of \nthe hand distribute weight through the whole hand. This protects the heel \nof the hand from too much pressure.\nLengthening\nSpine: Rectus abdominis, obliques, psoas major, sternocleidomastoid, supra-\nhyoid and infrahyoid muscles; psoas minor and obliques.\nLegs: Rectus femoris, iliacus, and psoas major.\nArms: Serratus anterior, biceps, pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, \nanterior deltoid subclavius.\nObstacles and Notes\nOften in this pose there is too much lumbar extension and not enough hip \nextension. The hamstrings should be the main extensors here, but if they are \nweak, the gluteus maximus can kick in. A problem with this, however, is that it \nbrings in external rotation, which is harder on the lower back. The gluteus maxi-\nmus can also overdo the lumbar extension.\nIf the hamstrings are too weak to do purvottanasana, then tabletop (chatus \npada pitham, discussed later in this chapter) is a great preparation.\nThe latissimus dorsi are not so helpful in this pose, because they can fix the \nscapulae on the rib cage and inhibit extension in the thoracic spine.\nBreathing\nIt’s an interesting challenge to downwardly rotate the scapulae and still extend \nthe spine. This is because depressing the scapulae tends to create flexion in \nthe spine. The solution to this dilemma is to allow the breathing movements to \nmobilize the upper rib cage and sternum, which will deepen the extension in the \nupper back from the front line of the body.\n196\nSalamba Sirsasana\nSupported Headstand\nsah-LOM-bah shear-SHAHS-anna\nsa = with\nalamba = that on which one rests or leans, support\nsirsa = head\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate inverted arm support\nVastus \nlateralis\nRectus \nfemoris\nRectus \nabdominis\nSerratus \nanterior\nTriceps\nHamstrings\nSpinal extensors\nInfraspinatus\nDeep neck muscles.\nObliquus \ncapitis \ninferior\nRectus capitis \nposterior \nmajor\nLongus colli\nRectus \ncapitis \nanterior\nRectus capitis \nposterior \nminor\nObliquus \ncapitis \nsuperior\n197\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral axial extension, or slight extension; hip extension; knee exten-\nsion; ankle neutral dorsiflexion; scapula abduction, upward rotation, and \nelevation; glenohumeral joint flexion, external rotation, and adduction; \nelbow flexion; forearm in neutral rotation.\nWeight Placement\nFor some, the ideal placement of the weight on the skull is on the bregma—the \njuncture between the coronal and sagittal sutures, where the frontal bone meets \nthe two parietal bones. This leads to a slightly more arched final position.\nPlacing the weight more toward the crown of the head leads to a more neutral \nspine and more balanced action between the front and back of the body.\nSupporting the weight on the bregma—the darker blue spot in left illustration—results in a slightly \nmore arched position (right). Supporting weight near the crown—lighter blue spot—leads to a \nmore neutral spine position.\n(continued)\nWorking\nSpine: The intrinsic muscles of the spine \n(intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, \nmultifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius \ncapitis and cervicis, longissimus, and \niliocostalis) are all active to lift up into \nheadstand, and to prevent falling down \nforward. Entering the pose demands \nwork in the extensors of the thoracic \nspine, which may be unaccustomed to \nlifting the weight of the whole lower \nbody. The psoas minor, obliques, rectus \nabdominis, and transversus are very \nactive in the pose, to keep from falling \nbackward. The pelvic diaphragm also is \ndrawn into action along with the lower \nabdominal muscles, creating a strong \nmula bandha effect.\n198\nNeck: The rectus capitis anterior, rectus capitis posterior major and minor, \nobliquus capitis superior and inferior, longus capitis, and longus colli all \nwork to balance the front and back of the atlanto-occipital joint and the \natlanto-axial joint.\nArms: Serratus anterior acts to wrap the scapulae; infraspinatus and teres \nminor externally rotate the arms; and supraspinatus and subscapularis help \nhold the head of the humerus in its socket. The triceps are active to stabi-\nlize the elbows as the extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris press the little finger \nside of the hands into the floor.\nLegs: The adductor magnus and hamstrings act to hold the legs together and \nextend the hip joints. The vastii extend the knees, and the medial fibers of \ngluteus maximus extend the hips (without external rotation).\nObstacles and Notes\nSpine: Many people have asymmetries and slight rotations in their spines, \nwhich become more apparent in this pose. Note the rotational shifts, sco-\nliosis, and other asymmetries in the illustration of the author in sirsasana.\nNeck: If the deep muscles of the neck are accessed, the jaw and vocal muscles \nare able to stay relaxed.\nSalamba Sirsasana  (continued)\nSemimembranosus\nSemitendinosus\nBiceps femoris\nAdductor magnus\nGluteus \nmaximus\nThe author’s scoliosis is exaggerated in sirsasana.\n199\nLegs: It can be a challenge to find full hip extension in this pose. If the \nabdominal muscles are not strong enough, the hips can flex to keep the \nwork of the pose in the back muscles instead of in the front.\nNote: Contrary to popular notions of increased blood or oxygen flow to the \nbrain in inversions, it should be noted that the body has very robust mechanisms \nthat control the amount of blood delivered to any given region—irrespective of \nthe orientation to gravity.\nRegional changes in blood pressure have been observed based on inversion or \ncompression of major blood vessels by body position, but this is a distinct issue \nfrom movement of blood volume and thus oxygen delivery.\nThat said, inversions do offer a very beneficial opportunity for increased \nvenous return from the lower body, as well as improved lymph drainage—not to \nmention the benefits derived from inverting the action of the diaphragm.\nTechnique\nEven if you favor the “bregma” version \nof this pose, and enter into the pose \nwith straight legs with the intention to \nend up in a more arched position, the \nstrength and coordination required to \nmaintain headstand safely demands \ncertain skills that can be best developed \nby practicing the bent-leg entry into the \npose. The key test is whether you can \nraise the weight off the feet without \njumping, and maintain the difficult pose \nknown as acunchanasana for several \nbreaths.\nBreathing\nWhen the support for sirsasana is \nderived from the deeper intrinsic mus-\ncles of the spine, as well as the coordi-\nnated action of the hamstrings, vastii, \npsoas minor, internal obliques, transver-\nsus abdominis, and serratus anterior, the weight forces of the body will be more \nneutralized in gravity. Then, the muscular effort of remaining in the pose will be \nminimized, and the breath will be calm and efficient. At that point, the inverted \nnature of the diaphragm’s action is emphasized because of the strong action of \nthe abdominal muscles and pelvic diaphragm, which help to stabilize the center \nof gravity over the base of support. All the internal organs, which anchor to the \ncentral tendon of the diaphragm, can move differently in inversions.\nAcunchanasana.\n200\nVrschikasana\nScorpion Pose\nvrs-chee-KAHS-anna\nvrschana = scorpion\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate inverted arm balance\nJoint Actions\nFull spinal extension; hip extension, adduction, internal rotation; knee flexion; \nankle neutral dorsiflexion; scapula adduction, upward rotation; glenohu-\nmeral joint external rotation, flexion, adduction; elbow flexion; forearm \npronation.\nVastus lateralis\nRectus femoris\nRectus abdominis\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nPsoas major\n201\nWorking\nSame as pincha mayurasana. In addition, the hamstrings flex the knees and \ndraw the toes down to the head (if the person is flexible enough in the \nfront line of body—otherwise, the legs hang passively in position). The ser-\nratus anterior works eccentrically as the scapulae adduct. Spinal extensors \nwork to deepen extension and lift the head against gravity and toward the \nfeet.\nLengthening\nSimilar to pincha mayurasana. Latissimus dorsi, iliacus, rectus femoris, forearm \nsupinators, abdominal muscles, internal intercostals, anterior neck muscles. \nThe rectus femoris and muscles of the anterior torso especially stretch; \nvastii lengthen with knee flexion, and pectoralis major and minor may \nlengthen with thoracic extension and scapula adduction.\nObstacles and Notes\nEven though pincha mayurasana is considered preparation for vrschikasana, scor-\npion is actually an easier pose to maintain because of its lower center of gravity.\nTo deepen from pincha mayurasana into scorpion, the scapulae need to slide \ntogether on the back, which lowers the rib cage toward the floor and creates \nmore mobility in the thoracic spine. The head then can lift and the thoracic spine \ncan extend further. This also changes the balance point from between the shoul-\nders to further caudal in the spine, made necessary by the bending of the knees.\nThe lifting of the head is important to shifting the balance point; otherwise, \nthe legs might overbalance the pose backward, causing you to fall into a back-\nbend.\nAs the knees bend actively toward the head, the hamstrings are in the shortest \nworking length. For this reason, they often cramp while trying to do this action.\nAs important as getting into this pose is the ability to get out of it and find the \nrelative neutrality of pincha mayurasana again. It’s a good idea to practice it in \na manageable range—entering and exiting the pose with control. This is a good \nchallenge because it gets muscles at maximum length to contract concentrically.\nBreathing\nBreathing in this pose is similar to breathing in pincha mayurasana, except that \nthe abdominal breath movement is limited by the stretch of the muscles there, \nrather than by their stabilizing contraction.\n202\nUrdhva Dhanurasana\nUpward Bow Pose, Wheel Pose\nOORD-vah don-your-AHS-anna\nurdhva = upward\ndhanu = bow\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nAnconeus\nPronators\nRectus abdominis\nPsoas \nmajor\nGluteus \nmaximus\nHamstrings\nVastus lateralis\n203\nClassification and Level\nIntermediate inverted backbend\nJoint Actions\nFull-spine extension; sacroiliac counternutation; hip extension, internal rota-\ntion, adduction; knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula upward rota-\ntion, abduction (deepens into scapular adduction with more thoracic \nextension); glenohumeral flexion, external rotation, adduction; elbow \nextension; forearm pronation; wrist dorsiflexion.\nWorking\nSpine: All the spinal extensors through the length of the spine are active, \nespecially the deeper layers: interspinalis, intertransversarii, rotatores, mul-\ntifidi, transversospinalis group. The psoas minor and abdominal muscles \nwork eccentrically to resist overmobilizing the lumbar spine, and encour-\nage extension in the thoracic spine.\nLegs: The hamstrings work to extend the hips; the adductor magnus extends, \ninternally rotates, and adducts the hips (the other adductors are less help-\nful because they tend to pull the hips into flexion). The gluteus maximus \nhelps to extend the hips, but too much gluteus action will also externally \nrotate the legs; vastii extend the knees.\nArms: The infraspinatus, teres minor, and posterior deltoids create external \nrotation at the glenohumeral joint, and the subscapularis protects the front \nof the joint. The serratus anterior abducts the scapulae and elevates the \narms; the deltoids flex the arms at the shoulders, and the triceps and anco-\nneus extend the elbows. The coracobrachialis flexes and adducts the arms \nat the shoulders. The pronators in the forearms turn the palms toward the \nfloor.\nLengthening\nLegs: Rectus femoris, psoas major, and iliacus.\nTorso: Abdominal muscles and anterior rib cage muscles, primarily internal \nintercostals and anterior neck muscles.\nArms: Pectoralis major and minor, latissimus dorsi.\n(continued)\n204\nUrdhva Dhanurasana  (continued)\nHand musculature mirroring the layers found in the foot (page 37).\n205\nObstacles and Notes\nOverall, the correct leg action is critical to getting into the upward bow. Most \npeople instinctively use their quadriceps in a pushing action, which thrusts weight \ntoward the head and arms, making it very difficult to raise the upper body off \nthe floor. Initiating the lift of the pelvis with more of a “pulling” action resolves \nthis difficulty.\nOne of the challenges to accomplishing this is to use the hip extensors to sup-\nport the action in the legs, rather than the quadriceps as knee extensors. The \nstrength of the hamstrings and adductor magnus can significantly decrease the \nwork in the quadriceps.\nOf the adductor group, the adductor magnus is most useful for upward bow, \nbecause it creates hip extension and internal rotation along with adduction—all \nactions that support the alignment of the pose. The gluteus maximus is less \nuseful for hip extension in this position, because it can create external rotation, \nwhich can lead to compression in the sacrum and lower-back pain.\nThe arms need to move freely overhead, and a combination of mobilizing the \nscapulae and stabilizing the external rotation in the shoulder joints with the rota-\ntor cuff creates the necessary balance. If the latissimus dorsi are tight, they will \nrestrict the ability of the scapulae to upwardly rotate. This can force excessive \naction into the spine or shoulder joints.\nSimilarly, if there is restriction in hip extension, too much of the action can \naccumulate in the lumbar spine.\nBreathing\nMany students have been frustrated by their inability to take deep, full breaths \nin urdhva dhanurasana. The reason for this is simple: In this shape, the body is \nstabilized in a maximal inhalation, and there is very little one can do to expand \nfurther if attempting to inhale deeply. Quiet, relaxed breathing is preferable. The \nmore efficient the muscle action in the pose is, the less oxygen you’ll need to fuel \nthe effort.\n206\nVasisthasana\nSide Plank Pose (Sage Vasistha’s Pose)\nvah-sish-TAHS-anna\nvasistha = a sage; most excellent, best, richest\nPronator \nteres\nFlexor carpi \nradialis\nExternal \nobliques\nTriceps \nSerratus \nanterior\nGluteus \nmaximus\nRectus \nfemoris\nVastus \nlateralis\nClassification and Level\nBasic one-arm balance\nJoint Actions\nSpine neutral; hip neutral \nextension, adduction, \nand internal rota-\ntion; knee extension; \nankle dorsiflexion and \nfeet everted against \nthe pull of grav-\nity; scapula neutral \n(abducting against \nthe pull of gravity); \nglenohumeral lateral \nabduction, exter-\nnal rotation; elbow \nextension; bottom \nhand—forearm \npronation, wrist \ndorsiflexion; top \nhand—forearm \nneutral, wrist neu-\ntral extension.\nWorking\nSpine: Spinal extensors, abdominal obliques, rectus abdominis, and transver-\nsus, to maintain the neutral curves of the spine; quadratus lumborum, to \nresist the hips dropping to the floor; bottom-side sternocleidomastoid and \ntop-side splenius capitis, to turn the head upward.\nTorso: Top side: external obliques, concentrically, to resist the hips twisting \nforward; internal obliques, eccentrically, to resist the hips falling back. \nBottom side: internal obliques, concentrically, to draw the right hip for-\nward; external obliques, eccentrically, to resist the hips falling back.\nLegs: Top leg: adductor magnus, to internally rotate and extend the hips; \nhamstrings, to extend the hips; vastii, to extend the knees; tibialis anterior, \n207\nto dorsiflex the ankles; extensor digitorum, to extend the toes.

The asymmetrical relationship to gravity means that \nmuscles have to work asymmetrically to create a symmetrical alignment of the \nbody—essentially tadasana turned on its side.\nThere are many ways that gravity pulls the body out of tadasana in this pose: \nThe spine may twist, the hips may fall forward or the shoulders may fall back (or \nvice versa), the bottom scapula and bottom leg may both adduct, and the pelvis \nmay fall to the floor. It’s easy to overcompensate by lifting the hips too high, \nor to create lateral flexion of the spine in either direction, by either giving in to \ngravity or overresisting it.\nOverall, the side plank pose is very simple, but not very easy.\nBreathing\nFrom the standpoint of the breath, this pose has much in common with nira-\nlamba sarvangasana (unsupported shoulder stand). It is also a challenging bal-\nance pose that requires a lot of stabilizing action in the abdominal and thoracic \nmusculature. Side plank is a bit easier, because the arms can be used for support \nand balance, but deep breathing will still have the effect of destabilizing the \npose.\nEfficiency—finding the minimum amount of effort necessary to maintain the \nposition—allows the limited breath movements to supply just enough energy to \nsustain the pose.\n208\nChatus Pada Pitham\nFour-Footed Tabletop Pose\nCHA-toos pada PEE-tham\nchatur = four\npada = foot\npitham = stool, seat, chair, bench\nClassification and Level\nBasic backbending arm support\nJoint Actions\nSlight lumbar and thoracic extension; cervical extension; hip neutral exten-\nsion, adduction, internal rotation; knee flexion; ankle dorsiflexion; scapula \ndownward rotation, adduction, elevation; glenohumeral joint extension and \nexternal rotation; elbow extension; forearm pronation; wrist dorsiflexion.\nDeltoid\nTriceps\nAnconeus\nSpinal \nextensors\nGluteus \nmaximus\nHamstrings\nQuadriceps\nRhomboids\nGluteus \nminimus\nBiceps femoris\nSemitendinosus\nSemimembranosus\nTrapezius\n209\nWorking\nLegs: The body weight in gravity wants to flex and abduct the hips, so the ham-\nstrings and adductor magnus must maintain hip extension, adduction, and \ninternal rotation. The gluteus maximus helps with hip extension but not so \nmuch that it will externally rotate the leg. The quadriceps are working eccen-\ntrically, and the tibialis anterior is drawing the knees forward, over the feet.\nArms: This is one of the few yoga poses that concentrically works the rhom-\nboids, which along with the middle trapezius, adduct the scapulae. The \nlevator scapulae work to elevate the scapulae. The teres major, triceps, \nposterior deltoids, and latissimus dorsi work to extend the arms and down-\nwardly rotate the scapulae. The triceps extend the elbows; pronators in the \nforearms turn the hands toward the floor.\nTorso: The abdominal muscles (obliques and rectus abdominis) and the psoas \nminor work to resist lumbar hyperextension from gravity.\nLengthening\nLegs: Quadriceps (eccentrically), iliacus, psoas major and minor.\nTorso: Abdominal muscles (all layers are working at length), anterior neck \nmuscles.\nArms: Pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis.\nObstacles and Notes\nWeakness in the hamstrings makes it hard to create neutral extension of the hip \njoints, so many people use the quadriceps to extend the knee and push the foot \ninto the floor. The problem here is that this tends to also create hip flexion, which \nobstructs the opening at the front of the hip joint. Overusing the gluteus maxi-\nmus will also externally rotate the hip, which the adductors will counter, creating \neven more restriction at the hip joint.\nToo much tightness in the pectoral region will prevent the scapulae from \nmoving into position (adduction) and will result in either too much movement in \nthe glenohumeral joint or flexion of the spine, which will challenge the breathing.\nIf the chest is able to rise effectively in relation to the shoulder girdle, the base \nof the skull can (in most people) find a resting place on a “shelf” that’s formed \nby the upper trapezius muscles. This can provide a very nice release of the ante-\nrior neck structures without the risk of hyperextending the cervical spine (see a \nsimilar effect in ustrasana in chapter 6).\nBreathing\nUnlike urdhva dhanurasana (upward bow), tabletop pose is not an extreme \nbackbend that restricts major respiratory movements. The combination of lifting \naction in the back body and release in the front body makes for an interesting \nopportunity to experiment by moving the breath around the abdominal and tho-\nracic regions. Some breathing patterns will have more of an effect on the stability \nof the pose, whereas others will assist in opening the upper rib cage.\n"

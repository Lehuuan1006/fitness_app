As I’ll \nrepeat throughout this document, the primary goal of The Fundamentals Program is \nto establish a solid strength base with specifically selected foundational exercises. \nThere are three separate 8-week programs included: a full body routine (3 days per \nweek), an upper/lower routine (4 days per week) and a bodypart split routine (5 days \nper week). The level of volume and the types of exercises included in each routine \nare very similar, meaning that the three routines are equally appropriate regardless \nof your experience level. In other words, you will see the same results running either \nof the three routines in whatever order you see fit and according to your schedule or \nyour training preferences. All three are included to provide variety, so that you can \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n7\npick a routine that suits your needs best and, once you run through it, you have the \noption of running another two unique programs for 8 weeks a piece.\nWHAT THIS PROGRAM ISN’T\nThis Fundamentals Training Program manual is not intended to be an all-inclusive \nresource for all things training related. I initially wrote this document as a supplement \nto my Training Fundamentals YouTube Series, meaning that there will be information \ncovered in the series that won’t be recapitulated here. At the time of writing, I plan \nto release The Fundamentals Book (title subject to change) later in 2018 or early \n2019 which will cover anything and everything training related from A to Z. The \nmain purpose of this program is to provide three tangible, actionable programs \nthat can be executed without having to understand all of the underpinnings of my \nprogramming science and philosophy. With that said, there is still plenty to chew on \nhere: just about 90 pages in total, including a full blown anatomy section (something \nI didn’t have the chance to cover in my Fundamentals YouTube Series in detail), a \nsection explaining the specific programming principles at play (volume, intensity, \nfrequency, etc.), video links for technique demonstration for each exercise and 26 \nunique scientific references. Still, if you’re an unexperienced new trainee, I would \nstrongly recommend watching my Fundamentals YouTube Series, since it will help \nstrengthen your grasp of the concepts being discussed here. \nThis program isn’t intended to teach or instruct you on basic lifting technique and \nassumes you already have a basic understanding of how to perform the exercises \nincluded with proper form. If there are any exercises you aren’t familiar or confident \nwith, please refer to the video links section for demonstration. It also comes strongly \nrecommended that you have a personal trainer, coach or experienced friend provide \nfeedback on your technique for new movements.\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n8\nKEY TERMS\nDB: Dumbbell\nLSRPE: Last set RPE\nPROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD: The gradual increase of stress placed upon the body \nduring exercise training. In training contexts, this generally involves progressively \nincreasing some lifting parameter over time (usually weight or reps)\nROM: Range of motion\nRPE: Rate of perceived exertion. A measure of how difficult a set was on a 1-10 scale, \t\nwith 10 meaning muscular failure was achieved. \nTEMPO: The speed at which the lift occurs. \nDOMS: Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n9\nANATOMY\nFigure 1: The Main Posterior Muscles \nFigure 2: The Main Anterior Muscles\nMajor muscles of the body. \nRide side: superficial; left side: deep (posterior view)\nMajor muscles of the body. \nRide side: superficial; left side: deep (anterior view)\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n10\nFUNCTIONAL ANATOMY\nIt is important to understand the functional anatomy and biomechanics of the \nmain muscles we’ll be targeting before we can understand how to best train them. \nFunctional anatomy determines what muscles can do. There are two things to \nconsider when looking at a muscle’s functional anatomy – its origin and insertion. \nMuscles attach to bone by tendons from at least two points. The origin is the fixed \nattachment which does not move and the insertion is the attachment which moves \ncloser to the origin when a muscle contracts. This is the contracting phase, referred \nto as the concentric phase (also known as the “positive” phase), which is normally \nfollowed by the eccentric phase (lowering the weight – also known as the “negative” \nphase).\nQUADRICEPS: The quadriceps (“quads” for short) are \ncomprised of four muscles, often referred to as “heads”: \nthe vastus lateralis (“quad sweep”), vastus medialis (“tear \ndrop”), rectus femoris (the middle portion of your upper \nthigh), and vastus intermedius (which runs underneath the \nrectus femoris). The quads act to extend the knee, taking \nthe leg from a bent position to a straight position. Each \nmuscle of the quad has its own unique insertion which we \nwon’t worry about too much here. Just remember that the \nmain action of the quads is to extend (straighten) the knee.\n \nORIGIN: The vasti muscles originate on the body of femur \n(“thigh bone”). The rectus femoris originates on the illium \nof the “hip bone”\nINSERTION: Tibial tuberosity\nEXERCISES: Squat, walking lunge, leg extension\nFigure 3: Quadriceps Anatomy \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n11\nHAMSTRINGS: The hamstrings are actually a \ncomplex of four muscles: semimembranosus, \nsemitendinosus, and biceps femoris (which \nconsists of a long head and a short head). \nThe hamstrings collectively act to both flex \nthe knee (take the leg from a straightened \nposition to a bent position, as in a leg curl) \nand extend the hip (pushing your hips \nforward, as in a deadlift).\n \nORIGIN: The semitendinosus, \nsemimembranosus, and long head of the \nbiceps femoris originate on the ischial \ntuberosity. The short head of the biceps \nfemoris originates on the linea aspera.\nINSERTION: The semitendinosus and \nsemimembranosus both insert on the tibia, \nwhile both the long and short heads of the \nbiceps femoris insert at the fibula.  \nEXERCISES: Deadlift, romanian deadlift, leg \ncurl\nFigure 4: Hamstrings Anatomy\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n12\nGLUTEALS: The gluteals (or “glutes”) are also a complex of muscles consisting of the \ngluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. As the name suggests, the \ngluteus maximus is the largest of the three, followed by the gluteus medius, and the \nsmallest gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus has multiple origins including the \npelvis, sacrum, coccyx, and thoracolumbar fascia and multiple insertions including \nthe upper femur and IT band. Because of this, it is able to perform a wide variety of \nfunctions, but primarily:\n\t\n- Hip extension (push your hips forward)\n\t\n- Hip abduction (move your thigh away from the midline)\n\t\n- Hip external rotation (rotating your thigh bone outwards)\n\t\n- Posterior pelvic tilt (tucking your butt “in”)\nThe smaller glute medius still occupies a hefty portion of the rear hip musculature \nand functions primarily as a stabilizer during dynamic movement and as a hip \nabductor. It originates on the pelvis and inserts on the femur. It is most effectively \ntrained with exercises that require a high degree of stability, especially unilateral \nmovements such as walking lunges, and exercises that train hip abduction, such as \nmachine hip abductions. \nORIGIN: The gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus \noriginate on the ilium.\nINSERTION: The gluteus maximus and gluteus minimus \ninsert to the iliotibial tract (IT band) and the gluteal \ntuberosity on the femur. The gluteus medius inserts to the \ngreater trochanter on the femur. \nEXERCISES: Hip thrust, squat, walking lunge, deadlift, \nmachine seated hip abduction\nFigure 5: Gluteals Anatomy \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n13\nPECTORALIS: There are two pectoralis muscles (pecs for short) located on your \nchest: the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor. The pectoralis major can be \ndivided into two heads: the clavicular head or “upper chest” (which originates at \nthe clavicle) and the sternal head or “lower chest” (which originates at the sternum). \nThe pecs act to adduct the upper arm (bring the upper arm across the body), and to \ninternally rotate the shoulder joint.  The clavicular fibers also aid in shoulder flexion \n(raising your upper arm up), but the sternal fibers do not.\nORIGIN: The pectoralis major originates on the sternum and clavicle. The pectoralis \nminor originates on the \n3rd-5th ribs.\nINSERTION: The \npectoralis major inserts \non the humerus. \nThe pectoralis minor \ninserts to the coracoid \nprocess (front of your \nshoulder).\nEXERCISES: Bench \npress, dumbbell incline \npress, cable flies, dips, \nmilitary press\nFigure 6: Pectoral Anatomy\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n14\nBACK: The back is \ncomprised of a massive web \nof muscles, so for the sake of \nsimplicity we will only look \nat the largest back muscles. \nThe latissimus dorsi (lats for \nshort) is a big muscle which \nruns from just underneath \nyour arm pit all the way \ndown to the bottom of your \nback. The lats primarily act to \nextend the shoulder (bring \nyour upper arm downward) \nand adduct the shoulder \n(moving your elbows \ntowards your mid back).\nThe trapezius (traps for \nshort), is another large \nmuscle running from the \nbase of the skull down to the \nmiddle of your inner back. \nWhen people think about \nthe traps, they tend to only \nthink of the upper fibers, but the middle and lower fibers take up a very large surface \narea as well. The traps act to elevate the scapulae (shrugging your shoulders), retract \nthe scapulae (pull the shoulder blades back), and extend the shoulder (pull your \narms backward when your elbows are raised).\nFigure 7: Latissimus Dorsi Anatomy\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n15\nLATS:\nORIGIN: Illiac crest and thoracolumnar \nfascia\nINSERTION: Humerus\nEXERCISES: Supinated pulldowns, \nchest-supported T-bar row, seated face \npull, deadlift (isometric contraction to \nprevent shoulder flexion)\nTRAPS: \nORIGIN: Occipital bone (upper traps), \ncorresponding supraspinous ligaments \nfor the mid and lower traps\nINSERTION: nuchal ligament\nEXERCISES: Chest-supported T-bar \nrow, cable seated row, seated face \npull, deadlift (isometric contraction to \nprevent scapular depression)\nFigure 8: Trapezius Anatomy\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n16\nBICEPS: The biceps brachii \nare a two-headed muscle \ncontaining a long head and a \nshort head. They collectively \nact to flex the elbows (bring \nthe elbow from a straightened \nposition to a bent position), \nand supinate the wrist \n(twist the pinky upwards). \nThe brachialis, which runs \nunderneath the biceps brachii, \nis also a strong elbow flexor.\nORIGIN: coracoid process, supraglenoid tubercle\nINSERTION: Radial tuberosity\nEXERCISES: Supinated pulldowns, dumbbell supinated curl, single-arm cable curl\nFigure 9: Biceps Anatomy \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n17\nTRICEPS: The triceps lie on the back of your upper arm and are made up of three \nheads: a long head, a medial head, and a lateral head. The triceps collectively act \nto extend the elbow (bring the elbows \nfrom a bent position to a straightened \nposition). \nORIGIN: Infraglenoid tubercle, radial \ngroove\nINSERTION: Olecranon process on ulna\nEXERCISES: Rope triceps extension, \ndips, dumbbell skull crusher, bench \npress, military press, dumbbell incline \npress\nDELTOIDS: The deltoids (or delts for short) are \ncomprised of 3 different heads, the anterior deltoid \n(the “front” delt), the lateral deltoid (also known as the \n“middle” delt, and often mistakenly called the “medial \ndelt”), and the posterior delt (also known as the “rear” \ndelt). The anterior delt acts to flex the shoulder (raise \nthe arm up), the lateral delt acts to abduct the upper \narm (raise your upper arm out directly to your sides), \nand the posterior delt acts to abduct the shoulder (pull \nthe shoulder back when the elbows are raised).\n \nFigure 10: Triceps Anatomy\nFigure 11: Deltoid Anatomy\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n18\nORIGIN: Clavicle, acromion process, spine of scapula\nINSERTION: deltoid tuberosity of humerus\nEXERCISES: Military press, dumbbell incline press, barbell bench press, lateral raise, \nseated face pull\nABS: The abs are a huge web containing many muscles which all have a similar \nfunction. When talking about the abs, we are typically referring to the rectus \nabdominis – which is the muscle that makes the “6-pack”. The rectus abdominis acts \nto flex the spine, rotate the torso, and resist spinal extension (prevent your lower \nback from arching inwards).\nORIGIN: Crest of pubis\nINSERTION: Xiphoid process\nEXERCISES: Crunches, planks\nFigure 11: Abdominal Anatomy \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n19\nCALVES: The calves are a complex consisting of two muscles \n– the gastrocnemius (or gastroc for short) and the soleus. \nThe gastrocnemius is the big muscle underneath the back \nof your knee and the soleus is a smaller, flatter muscle which \nruns underneath the gastroc down to your ankle. Both the \ngastroc and soleus act to plantarflex the ankle (point your \ntoes down). \nORIGIN: Lateral and medial condyle of femur\nINSERTION: tendo calcaneus\nEXERCISE: Standing calf raise\n \nFigure 12: Anatomy of the Calf Muscles\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n20\n1: \tHow do I know if I am progressing?\nA: \tBodybuilding is a marathon, not a sprint. It can be difficult to accurately \ndetermine if you are making visual progress day-to-day or even week-to-week. \nTaking physique progress photos every 4-6 weeks and comparing them side by \nside is a good way to detect visual differences that you simply wouldn’t notice in the \nmirror. But ultimately, because of the relationship between strength gain and muscle \ngain, the main metric I want you to use for tracking your progress is strength. If \nyou’re getting stronger, you’re progressing. It is strongly recommended to log every \nworkout either in writing (print the program out or use a separate notebook) or in an \napp, so you don’t have to rely on memory to keep track of personal strength records. \nTaking body measurements a few times a year can also be helpful (arms, thigh, waist, \nneck) but simply focusing on steady strength progression will be your best proxy for \ndetermining muscular progress.\nF.A.Q.\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n21\n2: \tHow much muscle can I expect to gain?\nA: \tHow you respond to training will be largely determined by genetic factors. As \na rough ballpark estimate for untrained male individuals, 1-2 lbs of muscle gain \nper month is reasonable (12-24 lbs of muscle gained in your first year). For early \nintermediates with about 1 year of lifting experience, progress will likely slow down \nto roughly 0.5-1 lbs of muscle gain per month (6-12 lbs of muscle gained in your \nsecond year). For practical purposes, women can divide muscle gain estimates in \nhalf.   \n3: \tWhat gym equipment should I use?\nA: \tGym equipment is optional as there are no required pieces of equipment to gain \nmuscle and increase strength. With that being said, investing in an 10mm prong or \nlever belt, knee sleeves, squat shoes, and straps can be beneficial in allowing you to \nlift more weight for certain exercises.\nYOU CAN FIND ALL OF MY RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT AT THE FOLLOWING LINKS: \nBELTS:\nhttps://www.rise.ca/collections/men-lifting-belts/products/old-school-leather-belt?ref=jeff\nhttps://www.rise.ca/collections/men-lifting-belts/products/10mm-lever-belt-black?ref=jeff\n \nSTRAPS:\nhttps://www.rise.ca/products/lifting-straps-military?ref=jeff\nKNEE SLEEVES:\nhttps://www.rise.ca/products/knee-sleeve-green?ref=jeff\nSQUAT SHOES:\nAdidas Powerlift 3.1 (The squat shoes I currently am using) - Link\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n22\n4: \tI have a belt. When should I wear it?\nA: \tOptionally use a lifting belt for working sets on exercises like squats, deadlifts and \noverhead (military) presses. Strength is a specific skill, so practice every rep in exactly \nthe same way (meaning, if you’re going to use a belt at all, use it consistently and for \nthe same movements). I wouldn’t recommend wearing on a belt on light warm-up \nsets.\n5: \tI am not getting sore from my workouts. Is the program not working?\nA: \tMuscle soreness is largely attributed to eccentric contractions [22] and long \nmuscle length contractions [23]. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) isn’t \nrequired for hypertrophy to occur, but the associated muscle damage might play a \nrole in hypertrophy [24]. With that said, the main goal of the program is to establish a \nstrength foundation, not to get you feeling sore. In fact, reduced soreness over time \nindicates that your body is adapting and recovering, which is actually a good thing \nfor continued progress. \n6: I am getting very sore from my workouts. Should I skip the gym until I am not \nsore?\nA: \tYou may experience increased soreness when you first begin the program \nbecause it is presenting a new stress to your body. Foam rolling can help reduce \nDOMS [25] and increase ROM [26], so if you are consistently getting sore week \nafter week, consider adding a short 3-5 minute foam rolling routine at the end of \nthe workouts. Otherwise, training while sore is not inherently problematic for muscle \ngrowth unless it puts you at an increased risk of injury. If you’re having a difficult \ntime getting into position for any of the planned exercises, or finding it difficult \nto complete a full ROM due to pain, do not train. Otherwise, in the case of mild \nsoreness, perform a slightly longer warm up for each exercise and use your own \ndiscretion with avoiding injury being a top priority. One extra rest day will not set you \nback very far, but a serious injury will. \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n23\n7: Should I eat in a caloric deficit, maintenance, or surplus while running this \nprogram? \nA:\t Eating in a slight caloric surplus will yield the best results and best recovery, \nhowever, if your main goal is fat loss, eating in a caloric deficit will be necessary. As a \nbeginner, you can continue to make strength and size progress while in a moderate \ncaloric deficit and achieve body recomposition (lose fat and build muscle at the \nsame time) if protein intake is sufficient (0.8-1g/lb bodyweight as a ballpark).\n8: The warm-up isn’t enough for me. Can I add to it?\nA: \tYou can add warm-up exercises to the protocol but your warm-up shouldn’t take \nany longer than 10-20 minutes. It is important to stay injury-free, so don’t rush into \nyour workout.\n9. \t Why is there such little exercise variation from week to week? \nA: \tChanging exercises from week to week is more likely to flatten out the strength \nprogression curve. While there is some variation from week to week, most exercises \nare kept constant to ensure both progression (by adding volume incrementally to \nthese specific movements) and mastery of exercise form and technique. If after 8 \nweeks you feel like you need to switch things up, then you can run one of the other 2 \nprograms included in this manual.\n10. There are 3 different splits. Which one should I run?\nA: \tSince adherence and sustainability are arguably the most important factors for \nlong term success, it is important to start with a program that you think you will enjoy \nand actually stick to. Have a look through the 3 programs and go with the one that \nlooks most appealing to you. I am a big fan of the upper/lower split personally, so if \nyou are totally unsure, that would be a good one to start with. \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n24\n11. What do I do after I finished the program?\nA: \tYou have the option of running back through the same program again for \nanother 8 weeks or moving on to one of the other splits provided. After the 1-2 year \nmark of running these programs, you will likely want to graduate on to one of my \nIntermediate Programs.  \n12. What are the blank boxes in the middle of each program for?\nA: \tThey are for you to track your weights each week, so you can focus on strength \nprogression from week 1 to week 8. Of course, this will only work if you print the \nprogram out. The other option would be to keep a notebook and simply pencil \nin your lifts each week. Keeping up with this habit of tracking is going to be an \nextremely important part of your success on this program. \nPlease direct all other question to info@strcng.com. Please avoid directing questions \nabout this program to my social media as it is not a reliable means of making contact \nwith me or getting the correct information. Please allow 3-5 business days for an \nemail reply. \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n25\nBefore we look at exactly how you should warm-up, it’s important to consider \nwhat the warm-up portion of your training session serves to accomplish. Warming \nup should function to increase your core body temperature, which improves \nperformance [1] [2]. Your circadian rhythm also helps determine your core body \ntemperature at any given point in time. When you wake up, your core body \ntemperature is at its lowest, and it increases throughout the day.  There seems to be \na “sweet spot” for core body temperature, so doing 5-10 minutes of low-moderate \nintensity cardio is especially prudent if you exercise early in the morning [3]. \nSecondly, warm-ups serve as a way to increase muscle activation. Doing dynamic \nwarm-ups (exercises and drills which take you through a range of motion) can \nimprove performance and force output [4]. Don’t view your warm-up as just “going \nthrough the motions.” The goal is to always be very mindful about the muscles you \nWARM UP\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n26\nare contracting and the bodily movements you’re doing. A proper and complete \nwarm up helps strengthen this mindfulness. \nLastly, foam rolling has been shown to reduce DOMS (delayed onset muscle \nsoreness)  [5]. Brief foam rolling with a specific focus on “tight areas” before a \nsession can improve range of motion [6] and prevent injury [7]. Light foam rolling for \n2-3 minutes prior to lifting is recommended.\nBefore beginning with your working weight for the first exercise for each bodypart, \nperform a basic loading pyramid where you pyramid up in weight with 1-3 light sets, \ngetting progressively heavier until you reach your working weight for that exercise. \nEXERCISE\nSETS\nREPS/TIME\nNOTES\nLOW INTENSITY CARDIO\nN/A\n5-10MIN\nPICK ANY MACHINE WHICH ELEVATES YOUR HEART RATE TO \n100-135BPM\nFOAM ROLLING/LACROSSE BALL\nN/A\n2-3MIN\nFOAM ROLL LARGE MUSCLE GROUPS: QUADS, LATS, CALVES. \nOPTIONALLY USE A LACROSSE BALL FOR SMALLER MUSCLE \nGROUPS: PECS, DELTS, HAMSTRINGS\nFRONT/BACK LEG SWING\n2\n12\n12 EACH LEG\nSIDE/SIDE LEG SWING\n2\n12\n12 EACH LEG\nSTANDING GLUTE SQUEEZE\n2\n15 SEC\nSQUEEZE YOUR GLUTES AS HARD AS POSSIBLE\nPRONE TRAP RAISE\n2\n15\nMIND MUSCLE CONNECTION WITH MID BACK\nCABLE EXTERNAL ROTATION\n2\n15\n15 EACH SIDE\nCABLE INTERNAL ROTATION\n2\n15\n15 EACH SIDE\nOVERHEAD SHRUG\n2\n15\nLIGHT SQUEEZE ON TRAPS AT THE TOP OF EACH REP\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n27\nEXERCISE SUBSTITUTIONS\nIf for whatever reason you are unable to perform any of the exercises in this program, \nI have provided a list of suitable alternatives. While I encourage you to run the \nprogram as written and include all of the listed exercises if possible, in the case of \nrisking an injury or flare up, it is always wise to avoid exercises that you think may \ncause pain and stick to exercises that you can perform safely. The exercises below \nare the ones that most commonly require substitutions. When making a substitution, \nkeep the sets, reps, rest times, etc. the same and simply swap out one movement for \nthe other as you feel appropriate. \nSQUAT: Leg Press + 15 reps of lower back extensions (for example, if you were \nprogrammed to do 3 sets of 8 reps on the squat, but are unable to squat, substitute \nsquats for 3 sets of 8 on the leg press and then add an additional 3 sets of 15 reps of \nlower back extensions).\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n28\nDEADLIFT: Barbell Hip Thrust + 15 reps of lower back extensions (see description \nabove)\nROMANIAN DEADLIFT: Glute Ham Raise\nDB WALKING LUNGE: Single Leg Dumbbell Hip Thrust \nBARBELL HIP THRUST: Leg Extension Machine Hip Thrust\nMACHINE STANDING CALF RAISE: Dumbbell Standing Calf Raise (hold a dumbbell \nin one hand and use the other hand for balance)\nLYING LEG CURL: Dumbbell Leg Curl (place a dumbbell between your legs, lie on a \nbench and curl it up)\nLEG EXTENSION: If you’re unable to perform leg extensions, simply remove them \nfrom the program since they are not a mandatory exercise for quad growth\nMACHINE SEATED HIP ABDUCTION: Standing Cable Hip Abduction or Plate-\nLoaded Hip Abduction (place a 25-35 lb plate on the side of your upper thigh and \nperform abductions) \nBARBELL BENCH PRESS: Dumbbell Bench Press or Hammer Strength Machine Press\nDUMBBELL INCLINE PRESS: Hammer Strength Machine Incline Press\nMILITARY PRESS: Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press\nCABLE FLY: Dumbbell Fly or Pec Deck\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n29\nASSISTED DIP: Decline Dumbbell Press or Decline Barbell Press or Hammer Strength \nDecline Press\nSUPINATED PULLDOWN: Reverse Grip Assisted Pullup\nSEATED CABLE ROW: 1-Arm Dumbbell Row\nCHEST-SUPPORTED T-BAR ROW: Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row (brace your \nupper chest against an incline bench and perform rows with two dumbbells at the \nsame time)\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n30\nREST DAYS AND TRAINING DAYS\nWhile your body doesn’t know what day of the week it is, it is a good idea to get \ninto a consistent 7 day lifting schedule that ensures you aren’t skipping sessions and \nfalling behind on the program.

For this reason, this program focuses primarily \non building a solid strength base with carefully selected, fundamental movements.  \nThe exercises included here should be mastered before moving on to other more \ncomplex (or more niched) variations. The program sticks mainly to compound \nmovements (exercises which use multiple joints and go through a large range of \nmotion). Since compound movements move multiple joints, they generally stimulate \nmore overall muscle mass than isolation movements (single joint movements) and as \nsuch optimize your time and effort investment in the gym. \nPROGRAM EXPLAINED\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n81\nHOW DO I PROGRESS?\nProgressive overload is generally regarded as the most important programming \nprinciple for all strength and size related goals. Because of the correlation between \nmuscle size and strength [8] we simply cannot ignore the interplay between getting \nstronger and getting bigger, especially when building a solid foundation. In this \nprogram, progression will occur in the form of adding weight (load) or adding \nreps with the same amount of weight. This is what is usually meant by “progressive \noverload”. It can also been seen as using better form with the same weight, using a \nlarger range of motion, improving the mind-muscle connection, etc. \nAdding weight to the bar/dumbbell/machine will be dependent on your experience \nlevel. For practical purposes, we can split this up into three different tiers relative to \ntraining experience: \n\t\n1. An untrained individual (less than 3 months of consistent training experience)\n\t\n2. A beginner (3-9 months of consistent training experience)\n\t\n3. Early-intermediates (9-18 months of consistent training experience)\nFor an untrained individual, the goal should be to focus more on mastering perfect \ntechnique rather than adding weight. I recommend using the same weight for at \nleast 3 weeks straight to ensure technique mastery before increasing the resistance. \nDeveloping a technique-base is even more foundational than developing a strength \nbase since training with poor technique can lead to injury and halted progress. Once \nexercise technique can be executed properly and you graduate to beginner territory, \nyou can aim to make small increases in weight week to week, as your nervous system \nbegins to engrain new motor patterns [9].\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n82\nAs a beginner, you can and should expect to make very consistent strength gains. \nWhile you may be tempted to make big jumps in weight as your strength and \nconfidence improves, you should stick to a simple linear progression: consistently \nadd the same load over a period of time rather than making big jumps less \nfrequently. When compared to nonlinear periodization (more commonly known \nas undulating periodization), linear periodization is equally effective for gaining \nstrength [10] and since lifting form changes with different percentages of your \nmaximum strength [11], it is safer and more reliable to make smaller jumps from \nweek to week. Keep in mind that adding just 5lbs total to the bar per week for only \n26 weeks (6 months) will yield a 130 lb increase in strength.\nFor a low-intermediate, these consistent, linear strength gains will slowly start to \ndiminish. This is when using rate of perceived exertion (RPE for short) will come in \nhandy. RPE is a scale from 1-10: 1 meaning there’s ~10% of maximal effort, and 10 \nmeaning there’s 100% maximal effort. Since training close to (but not necessarily \nall the way to) concentric muscular failure is important for both strength and \nhypertrophy [12], we will be aiming for an RPE of 6 or above on all sets in this \nprogram. This generally means no more than 4 reps are being “left in the tank”.\nAnother way to see RPE is reps in reserve (or RIR). RIR is inversely related to RPE. \nA 10RPE is an all-out set, meaning you have 0 reps left in reserve. A 9RPE is a very \nhard set, meaning you have ~1-2 reps left in reserve. An 8RPE is still a difficult set, \nmeaning you have 2-3 reps in reserve. And so on.\nRPE has been shown to be an effective method for choosing a load, even when \ncompared to a percent of 1-rep maximum [13], so it is important to start developing \nthis skill. The closely related Reps In Reserve (RIR) methodology has also proven to \nbe a viable tool for predicting load as a relates to effort, including in beginners [14]. \nTo progress using the RPE method, you should use a set load and only increase the \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n83\nweight when the RPE decreases by 1 point (the set feels ~10% easier than it did \nwhen you first started using that load).\nWHAT IS THE MIND-MUSCLE CONNECTION? \nHOW DO I DEVELOP IT?\nThe mind-muscle connection is the act of focusing on using the target muscle \nto move the weight (not just “going through the motions”). Research has shown \nincreased muscle activation when subjects are instructed to use “internal cueing” \n(such as squeezing your glutes as hard as possible to get the barbell to move in a \nhip thrust) when compared to “external cueing” (such as simply moving the barbell \nupwards) [15]. The mind-muscle connection is a skill that takes time to develop, \nbut strength level doesn’t seem to impact its development [16], meaning you \nshould begin to cultivate it early. Generally speaking, I think that the mind muscle \nconnection should be used only sparingly (if at all) on squats, deadlifts and overhead \npresses as these are highly technique-focused exercises that will activate a large \nmuscle mass regardless of attentional focus. For these movements, it is better to \nfocus on the movement of your entire body and simply execute the exercise with \nproper technique through a full range of motion. For all isolation exercises and \nany remaining compound exercises, you can use the mind-muscle connection to \nincrease activation of the target muscle as you feel appropriate. \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n84\nFREQUENCY\nThe main thing we can conclude from the scientific literature on frequency is that \ntraining each muscle twice per week is better than only training each muscle once \nper week [17]. One potential limitation of the training frequency research is that \nmost studies are volume equated, meaning the subjects are actually doing the same \namount of total work. In the real world, it is much less likely that volumes would be \nequal when frequencies are different. Higher frequency training typically allows us \nto do more volume within a training week. To illustrate this point, just imagine the \nfatigue differences between doing 3 sets of squats 3 days per week (somewhat \nmanageable) compared to doing 9 sets of squats in a single session (brutal). So what \nthe frequency research really tells us is that:\nTRAINING VARIABLES\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n85\n\t\n1. There is probably no special benefit to training a muscle more than twice per \t \t\n\t\nweek with the same amount of volume.\n\t\n2. Training a muscle more than once per week is more optimal for hypertrophy, \t\n\t\n\t\neven when volume is the same. \nINTENSITY (EFFORT AND LOAD)\nHow much effort should you put into each set? \nAs an untrained individual, intensity (effort) should be lower than it should be for \na more highly trained individual. If you feel like you could be training a bit harder, \nyou are probably working at the perfect pace. Since strength is neuromuscular, \ndeveloping poor technique habits from pushing sets too close to failure can put \nyou at an increased risk for injury and engrain bad lifting habits.  For an untrained \nindividual, keeping sets closer to an RPE of 5-7 is recommended. \nAs you begin to progress toward the late beginner/early intermediate stage, having \nmastered proper lifting technique, you can begin to exert yourself harder and \nbenefit from taking more sets closer to failure. For this individual, taking sets to an \nRPE of 7-8 is usually the sweet spot. \nHow much weight (load) do you lift? How heavy do you go?\nAs previously mentioned, the primary goal of this program is to develop a strong \nfoundation. RPE is a helpful tool for both load selection and for determining how \nmuch effort goes into each set. An appropriately selected weight generally means \nthat you can safely perform the target reps with proper form and at the prescribed \nRPE. \nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n86\nVOLUME\nVolume is a central factor determining hypertrophic potential. Volume can be \nviewed as both volume per-session and volume per-week. Per-session volume \nrequirements are actually very low, with research showing that just one set can serve \nas an “adequate” stimulus for generating a hypertrophic response. [18] However, \nwhile this low volume approach can cause some hypertrophy, multiple sets (3-5 sets) \nper muscle group are thought to be required to maximize hypertrophy [19]. It is \nimportant to note that not all volume is created equal and more volume isn’t always \nthe answer. One 2018 study comparing 5 sets of 10 reps versus 10 sets of 10 reps \non the squat actually showed greater strength responses in the 5 sets group, despite \nusing half the volume. Not only that - the 10 x 10 group actually lost muscle (on \naverage) in their legs [20]. So there does appear to be a “volume limit” past which \nfurther increases in volume are not helpful for stimulating more hypertrophy. James \nKrieger recommends a minimum of 10 sets per week per muscle group [21], with \n10-15 sets per bodypart per week being a good ballpark estimate for maximizing \nhypertrophy in nearly all beginners and early intermediates.\nI elaborate on these concepts at the links below:\n\t\nFUNDAMENTALS EP 2:\n \t\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S0NjKYlJ7I\n\t\nVOLUME SCIENCE EXPLAINED:\n\t\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwv3JqOUqWs\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n87\nBACK SQUAT: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5-C1fsMjk\nDEADLIFT:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc4_hq7tjkU\nROMANIAN DEADLIFT:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE-2Y-3a1pY\nDB WALKING LUNGE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vni4lElTvsY\nEXERCISE VIDEOS\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n88\nBARBELL HIP THRUST:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjWiwq1wgFg&t=2s\nLEG EXTENSION:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyvSfVjQeL0\nLYING LEG CURL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tq3QdYUuHs\nMACHINE STANDING CALF RAISE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AVIgDN72c0\nSINGLE-LEG LEG EXTENSION:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VIpG6rtFAc\nSINGLE-LEG LYING LEG CURL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQSlJHtsnRA\nMACHINE SEATED HIP ABDUCTION:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-seSnS4N8Xo\nCRUNCH:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGRKFMKhF8s\nPLANK:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL_NJAkCQBg\nBARBELL BENCH PRESS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esQi683XR44\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n89\nDB INCLINE PRESS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggJycLjz01E\nMILITARY PRESS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnBmiBqp-AI\nCABLE FLY:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJwiu8ttuZ0\nASSISTED DIP:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjUmnZH528Y\nDUMBBELL SKULL CRUSHER:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUZOn9c1VVI\nSINGLE-ARM ROPE TRICEP EXTENSION:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxK2mF0iPXs\nDUMBBELL LATERAL RAISE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m7JO28RqZg\nSUPINATED PULLDOWN:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzFTbsm7HU\nCABLE SEATED ROW:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRy8U542Fo\nCHEST-SUPPORTED T-BAR ROW:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0KnlQ-b7jw\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n90\nSEATED FACE PULL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSoHeSjvIdY\nCABLE REVERSE FLY:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnXb1dh_RjQ\nDUMBBELL SUPINATED CURL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykJmrZ5v0Oo\nJEFF NIPPARD  FUNDAMENTALS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM\n91\nFor customer support please email info@strcng.com.

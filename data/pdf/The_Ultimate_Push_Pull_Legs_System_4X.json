As \na powerlifter, Jeff has claimed a 502 lb squat, 336 lb \nbench press and a 518 lb deadlift with an all time best \nWilks score of 446.\n \r\nWith a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry, Jeff \nhas gathered the requisite scientific knowledge to \ncomplement his practical experience acquired through \ntraining and coaching. Jeff has coached women's bikini \nand men's bodybuilding national and provincial \nchampions, professional natural bodybuilders and \nnationally and IPF Worlds qualified raw powerlifters. He \nhas presented seminars on Block Periodization, \nconcurrent training and nutrition and training for natural \nbodybuilding in academic settings including the 2019 \nUltimate Evidence Based Conference (UEBC), Lehman \nCollege and the University of Iowa. He has aspirations of \ncompleting a PhD in exercise science or a related field.\n \r\nJeff currently lives in Ontario, Canada, where he is \nproducing YouTube videos and programs for people \naround the world.\nJeff is a professional natural \nbodybuilder and powerlifter. \nThrough his science-based Youtube \nchannel which has gathered a fan-\nbase of millions of subscribers, Jeff \nshares the knowledge he has \ngathered through university \neducation and field experience with \nothers who are passionate about the \nscience behind building muscle, \nlosing fat and gaining strength.\n4\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nABOUT this\nprogram\n5\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nI created this training plan for intermediate-advanced trainees looking to make \nthe absolute most out of their training. Unlike most push/pull/legs programs \nthat are humdrum and predictable, I am calling this routine a push pull legs \n“system” because it is organized in a very precise and calculated way to \nmaximize gains. Throughout this program, we’ll be borrowing from decades of \nsports science and years of personal experimentation to reach what I believe is \nthe pinnacle of the PPL split.\n\nWhat makes this program most unique is its use of three very distinct phases \nthat are sequenced in a specific way to optimize progress. Each phase has a \nvery specific goal that will carry into the next phase.\n\nPhase 1 is the Base Phase where we will use moderate-high volume and \nmoderate-high intensity plus a variety of advanced hypertrophy techniques to \n“lay the foundation” of hypertrophy.\n\nPhase 2 is the Maximum Overload Phase where we will use low volume and \nultra-high intensity to increase familiarity with true muscular failure and ensure \nprogressive overload is occuring.\n\nPhase 3 is the Supercompensation Phase where we will use ultra-high volume \nand moderate intensity to increase muscle size rapidly. A sudden, large increase \nin volume will provide a massive stimulus for new growth.\n\nWithin each phase (especially Phase 1 and 3) there are a variety of new and \neffective techniques that you won’t see in the more humdrum PPL routines. \nYou’ll find stuff like:\nWho is the \nUltimate PPL \nSystem for?\n6\nbottom-only reps (these are based on this 2021 study [1] on the \neffectiveness of partial rep training that emphasizes the stretch aspect of \nthe lift – and this 2022 study [2] and this other 2022 study [3] and this 2019 \nstudy [4]),\n\nfeeder sets (an approach I learned from my late dear mentor, John \nMeadows),\n\nmechanical dropsets (where you adjust technique mid-set rather than \nadjusting load to extend the set),\n\nwhat I call “acceptable cheating” (on exercises like Kroc Rows and Hammer \nCurls),\n\ncluster sets (we’ll be doing 6-10 sets of an exercise for low reps and very \nshort rest)\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nWhile it is perfectly possible to make progress in both strength and size at the \nsame time (this is the goal of my Powerbuilding Programs) it’s much more \ndifficult to optimize both strength and size at the same time. If your goal is to \noptimize progress with muscle growth, it is better to allocate more volume to \nhypertrophy-style training. In this program, we are seeking to optimize muscle \ngrowth, and will be prioritizing hypertrophy over strength.\n\nHowever, because strength can complement hypertrophy and because most \npeople who care about hypertrophy also want to be strong, we won’t be ignoring \nstrength altogether. To ensure that strength is not neglected entirely, this \nprogram uses a minimalistic approach toward strength and an optimization \napproach toward hypertrophy. This means we’ll be using just one heavy set for \neach of the powerlifts, plus a few back-off sets. At the very least this will be \nsufficient to maintain strength on these lifts and will be enough for most people \nto continue making strength gains on the powerlifts. It’s also worth mentioning \nthat while Phase 1 and 2 include all three powerlifts (squat, bench and deadlift), \nPhase 3 uses high rep front squats rather than back squats (*evil laugh*).\nWith all of that being said, the main emphasis of this program is clearly muscle \ngrowth.\n\nIf your goal is to work on both strength and hypertrophy equally, I’d consider \nchecking out my Powerbuilding Programs instead. If your goal is to maximize \nhypertrophy while having a more minimalistic focus on strength, this program \nwill be perfect for you.\nThis program was designed for intermediate-advanced trainees looking to get as \njacked as possible. Since training years in the gym are not equal across \nindividuals, it’s hard to pin down exactly what “intermediate-advanced” means, in \nterms of a specific training age. For example, some folks may have spent 10 \nyears training in the gym, but that time may only actually be “worth” 1 or 2 years, \nif they’ve spent the majority of their time pumping and going through the \nmotions without focus or direction. But as a general guide, if you’ve been \ntraining for roughly 2-5 years, with a generally serious approach toward your \ntraining sessions, you’ll make serious gains on this program. If you’ve been \ntraining without adequate structure for even a few months, it doesn’t matter how \nlong you’ve been in the gym, this program will get you back on the right track.\n7\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nWill we be \nfocusing on \nstrength or \nhypertrophy?\nWho this \nprogram is for\nIf you’ve been in the gym less than 1-2 years, I’d recommend running through my\nFundamentals Hypertrophy Program at least once before advancing to this \nroutine. This will ensure that you have established an adequate strength and \ntechnique base before jumping into the more advanced programming methods \nused here.\n\nThis program is not intended to be an all-inclusive resource for all things training \nrelated. For more background and information on my general training \nphilosophy, I encourage you to watch my Fundamentals Series on YouTube.\n\nWith that said, there is still plenty of information within these pages, including a \nfull blown functional anatomy section, a description of the programming \nprinciples at play (periodization, progression, exercise selection, etc.), video links \nfor technique demonstration for each exercise, exercise substitutions for each \nexercise, and 17 unique scientific references.\n8\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nWho this \nprogram isn’t \nfor\n9\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nkey terms\n10\nCONCENTRIC\nDB\nDOMS\nECCENTRIC\nEFFORT\nFREQUENCY\nHARD SET\nHYPERTROPHY\nINTENSITY\nLOAD\nLSRPE\nPERIODIZATION\nPROGRESSIVE\nOVERLOAD\nROM\nRPE\nTEMPO\nVOLUME\nThe gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise \ntraining.

Functional anatomy determines what muscles can do. \nThere are two things to consider when looking at a muscle’s functional anatomy – its origin and insertion.\r\nMuscles attach to bone by tendons from at least two points. The origin is the fixed attachment which does not \nmove and the insertion is the attachment which moves closer to the origin when a muscle contracts. This is \nthe contracting phase, referred to as the concentric phase (also known as the “positive” phase), which is \nnormally followed by the eccentric phase (lowering the weight – also known as the “negative” phase).\nQUADRICEPS\n\nThe quadriceps (“quads” for short) are comprised of \nfour muscles, often referred to as “heads”: the \nvastus lateralis (“quad sweep”), vastus medialis \n(“tear drop”), rectus femoris (the middle portion of \nyour upper thigh), and vastus intermedius (which \nruns underneath the rectus femoris). The quads act \nto extend the knee, taking the leg from a bent \nposition to a straight position. Each muscle of the \nquad has its own unique insertion which we won’t \nworry about too much here. Just remember that the \nmain action of the quads is to extend (straighten) \nthe knee.\n\nORIGIN: The vasti muscles originate on the body of \nfemur (“thigh bone”). The rectus femoris originates on \nthe illium of the “hip bone”\r\n\nINSERTION: Tibial tuberosity\r\n\nEXERCISES: Squat, walking lunge, leg extension\nFigure 3: Quadriceps Anatomy\n14\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nHAMSTRINGS\n\nThe hamstrings are actually a complex of four \nmuscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and \nbiceps femoris (which consists of a long head and a \nshort head). The hamstrings collectively act to both \nflex the knee (take the leg from a straightened \nposition to a bent position, as in a leg curl) and \nextend the hip (pushing your hips forward, as in a \ndeadlift).\n\nORIGIN: The semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and \nlong head of the biceps femoris originate on the ischial\r\ntuberosity. The short head of the biceps femoris \noriginates on the linea aspera.\r\n\nINSERTION: The semitendinosus and \nsemimembranosus both insert on the tibia, while both \nthe long and short heads of the biceps femoris insert at \nthe fibula.\r\n\nEXERCISES: Deadlift, romanian deadlift, leg curl\nFigure 4: Hamstrings Anatomy\n15\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nORIGIN: The semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and long head of the biceps femoris originate on the ischial\r\ntuberosity. The short head of the biceps femoris originates on the linea aspera.\r\n\nINSERTION: The semitendinosus and semimembranosus both insert on the tibia, while both the long and short heads of the biceps \nfemoris insert at the fibula.\r\n\nEXERCISES: Deadlift, romanian deadlift, leg curl\nFigure 5: Gluteals Anatomy\nGLUTEALS\n\nThe gluteals (or “glutes”) are also a complex of \nmuscles consisting of the gluteus maximus, gluteus \nmedius, and gluteus minimus. As the name \nsuggests, the gluteus maximus is the largest of the \nthree, followed by the gluteus medius, and the \nsmallest gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus \nhas multiple origins including the pelvis, sacrum, \ncoccyx, and thoracolumbar fascia and multiple \ninsertions including the upper femur and IT band. \nBecause of this, it is able to perform a wide variety \nof functions, but primarily:\nHip extension (push your hips forward)\r\nHip abduction (move your thigh away from the \nmidline)\r\nHip external rotation (rotating your thigh bone \noutwards)\r\nPosterior pelvic tilt (tucking your butt “in”)\r\n\nThe smaller glute medius still occupies a hefty \nportion of the rear hip musculature and functions \nprimarily as a stabilizer during dynamic movement \nand as a hip abductor. It originates on the pelvis and \ninserts on the femur. It is most effectively trained \nwith exercises that require a high degree of stability, \nespecially unilateral movements such as walking \nlunges, and exercises that train hip abduction, such \nas machine hip abductions. \n16\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nORIGIN: : The pectoralis major originates on the sternum and clavicle. The pectoralis minor originates on the 3rd-5th ribs.\n\nINSERTION: The pectoralis major inserts on the humerus. The pectoralis minor inserts to the coracoid process (front of your \nshoulder).\n\nEXERCISES:  Bench press, dumbbell incline press, cable flyes, dips, military press\nFigure 6: Pectoral Anatomy\nPECTORALIS\n\nThere are two pectoralis muscles (pecs for short) located on your chest: the pectoralis major and the \npectoralis minor. The pectoralis major can be divided into two heads: the clavicular head or “upper chest” \n(which originates at the clavicle) and the sternal head or “lower chest” (which originates at the sternum). The \npecs act to adduct the upper arm (bring the upper arm across the body), and to  internally rotate the shoulder \njoint. The clavicular fibers also aid in shoulder flexion (raising your upper arm up), but the sternal fibers do not.\n17\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nBACK\n\r\nThe back is comprised of a massive web of \nmuscles, so for the sake of simplicity we will only \nlook at the largest back muscles. The latissimus \ndorsi (lats for short) is a big muscle which runs from \njust underneath your arm pit all the way down to the \nbottom of your back. The lats primarily act to extend \nthe shoulder (bring your upper arm downward) and \nadduct the shoulder (moving your elbows towards \nyour mid back).\r\n\r\nThe trapezius (traps for short), is another large \nmuscle running from the base of the skull down to \nthe middle of your inner back. When people think \nabout the traps, they tend to only think of the upper \nfibers, but the middle and lower fibers take up a very \nlarge surface area as well. The traps act to elevate \nthe scapulae (shrugging your shoulders), retract the \nscapulae (pull the shoulder blades back), and extend \nthe shoulder (pull your arms backward when your \nelbows are raised).\nORIGIN: Illiac crest and thoracolumnar fascia\n\nINSERTION: Humerus\n\nEXERCISES: Supinated pulldowns, chest-supported T-bar \nrow, seated face pull, deadlift (isometric contraction to \nprevent shoulder flexion)\nLATS\nTRAPS\nORIGIN: Occipital bone (upper traps), corresponding \nsupraspinous ligaments for the mid and lower traps\n\nINSERTION: Nuchal ligament\n\nEXERCISES: Chest-supported T-bar row, cable seated row, \nseated face pull, deadlift (isometric contraction to \nprevent scapular depression)\nFigure 7: Latissimus Dorsi Anatomy\nFigure 8: Trapezius Anatomy\n18\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nBICEPS\n\r\nThe biceps brachii are a two-headed muscle \ncontaining a long head and a short head. They \ncollectively act to flex the elbows (bring the elbow \nfrom a straightened position to a bent position), and \nsupinate the wrist (twist the pinky upwards). The \nbrachialis, which runs underneath the biceps \nbrachii, is also a strong elbow flexor.\nTRICEPS\n\r\nThe triceps lie on the back of your upper arm and \nare made up of three heads: a long head, a medial \nhead, and a lateral head. The triceps collectively act\r\nto extend the elbow (bring the elbows from a bent \nposition to a straightened position).\nORIGIN: Coracoid process, supraglenoid tubercle\n\nINSERTION: Radial tuberosity\r\n\nEXERCISES: Supinated pulldowns, dumbbell supinated \ncurl, single-arm cable curl\nORIGIN: Infraglenoid tubercle, radial groove\n\nINSERTION: Olecranon process on ulna\r\n\nEXERCISES: Rope triceps extension, dips, dumbbell skull \ncrusher, bench press, military press, dumbbell incline press\nFigure 9: Biceps Anatomy\nFigure 10: Triceps Anatomy\n19\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nDELTOIDS\n\r\nThe deltoids (or delts for short) are comprised of 3 \ndifferent heads, the anterior deltoid (the “front” delt), \nthe lateral deltoid (also known as the “middle” delt, \nand often mistakenly called the “medial delt”), and \nthe posterior delt (also known as the “rear” delt). \nThe anterior delt acts to flex the shoulder (raise the \narm up), the lateral delt acts to abduct the upper \narm (raise your upper arm out directly to your \nsides), and the posterior delt acts to abduct the \nshoulder (pull the shoulder back when the elbows \nare raised).\nABS\n\r\nThe abs are a huge web containing many muscles \nwhich all have a similar function. When talking about \nthe abs, we are typically referring to the rectus \nabdominis – which is the muscle that makes the “6-\npack”. The rectus abdominis acts to flex the spine, \nrotate the torso, and resist spinal extension (prevent \nyour lower back from arching inwards).\nORIGIN: Clavicle, acromion process, spine of scapula\n\nINSERTION: Deltoid tuberosity of humerus\n\nEXERCISES: Military press, dumbbell incline press, barbell \nbench press, lateral raise, seated face pull\nORIGIN: Crest of pubis\n\nINSERTION: Xiphoid process\n\nEXERCISES: Crunches, planks\nFigure 11: Deltoid Anatomy\nFigure 12: Abdominal Anatomy\n20\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nCALVES\n\nThe calves are a complex consisting of two \nmuscles – the gastrocnemius (or gastroc for short) \nand the soleus. The gastrocnemius is the big \nmuscle underneath the back of your knee and the \nsoleus is a smaller, flatter muscle which runs \nunderneath the gastroc down to your ankle. Both \nthe gastroc and soleus act to plantarflex the ankle \n(point your toes down). \n\nORIGIN: Lateral and medial condyle of femur\n\nINSERTION: Tendo calcaneus\n\nEXERCISES: Standing calf raise\nFigure 13: Anatomy of the Calf Muscles\n21\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nFAQ\n22\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nQ:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nI don’t want to do the squat, bench or deadlift (SBD). How would I convert this into a pure \nbodybuilding program?\n\nFirst, remember that this program is very minimal in terms of SBD volume. For the most part, you’re \nonly doing each lift once a week for one hard set and a couple back-off sets. This amount of \nstrength work is unlikely to interfere with your hypertrophy goals in any significant way and may \nactually be beneficial if it allows you to overload other lifts more effectively. Still, if you want to avoid \nthe powerlifts altogether due to injury or preference, there are two substitution options for each lift \nthat you can do instead of the powerlifts. After substituting the exercise, keep the sets, reps, and \neverything else exactly the same. This will ensure that you still get some general strength work in. \nFor example, if the program calls for 1 set of 2 reps on the deadlift, you could substitute this for 1 \nset of 2 reps on either the trap bar deadlift or the barbell hip thrust.\n\nAs a second option, if you really don’t want to do any strength work at all, you can simply set a low-\nend rep cap at 4 reps for the entirety of the program. This means you simply won’t do any sets below \n4 reps. In this case, if a set calls for 1, 2 or 3 reps, you will simply do 4 reps instead. So, for example, \nif the program suggests that you do 1 set of 2 reps on the deadlift, you could substitute this for 1 set \nof 4 reps on either the deadlift, trap bar deadlift, or barbell hip thrust. If a set calls for 4 or more reps, \nsimply keep the reps the same. In the event that a set calls for 3-5 reps, just do 4-5 reps instead of \n3-5. I wouldn’t necessarily prefer this option because I do think strength work is important. However, \nif you don’t want to do any strength work, there isn’t a big issue in just replacing the sets below 4 \nreps as explained above.\n\nIn either case, because the direct strength work is quite low in this program, this should be a very \neasy work-around.\n\n\nI can’t do “X” exercise. What should I replace it with?\n\nEvery exercise includes two substitution options, which are listed in order of preference. This means \nthat if you can’t perform the original exercise, you should go with Substitution Option 1 first, and then \nSubstitution Option 2, if you can’t perform Option 1.\n\n\nCan I choose to do a Substitution Option even if I can perform the original exercise?\n\nYes. Whether you just prefer the other exercise or it’s one you have easier access to, feel free to go \nwith either of the Substitution Options over the original exercise. The program was designed so that \nall substitution options will elicit a very similar training effect. With that said, there are some \nintensity techniques that are better suited for specific exercises, so assuming you have access to \nthe exercise, I would default to doing the main exercise listed before turning to the substitution \noptions.\n\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n23\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nHow long should each workout take?\n\nEach workout should take you approximately 60-90 minutes from start to finish, including the warm-\nup, if you adhere to the rest periods given. If you take your time with the warm-up and are more lax \nwith rest times between sets, your workouts may take a bit longer.\n\n\n60-90 minutes is a bit too long for me. Is there a way for me to make these workouts shorter?\n\nYes, to reduce the time commitment of each session, you can first try aiming for the lower end of all \nof the suggested rest ranges. For example, if an exercise says to rest for approximately 2-3 minutes \nbetween sets, you would rest for just 2 minutes between sets.\n\nIf this doesn’t sufficiently reduce your workout time, you can try supersetting isolation exercises \nwithin the program. For example, on Leg Day #1 of Week 1, you could superset Leg Press Toe Press \nwith Decline Plate Crunch. In this instance, you would perform your set of Leg Press Toe Press, then \ntransition to a set of Decline Plate Crunches, and then go back to Leg Press Toe Press to repeat this \nprocess, with minimal rest between exercises. The goal is to still get about 1 minute of rest before \nreturning to each exercise, while the act of supersetting allows one muscle to rest while the other \nworks.\n\nIf all of these adjustments still don’t save you enough time, you may want to consider running my \nEssentials Program, which was specifically designed with busy people in mind and guarantees \nworkouts that last under 45 minutes.\n\n\nMy gym is crowded. Can I switch up the exercise order?\n\nYes, but try your best to keep compound movements at the beginning of the workout and save \nisolation movements for the end. This is to prevent the isolation exercises from interfering with your \nstrength on the compound lifts.\n\n\nHow do I know if I am progressing?\n\nBodybuilding is a marathon, not a sprint. It can be difficult to accurately determine if you’re making \nvisual progress day-to-day or even week-to-week. Taking physique progress photos every 4-6 weeks \nand comparing them side by side is a good way to detect visual differences that you simply wouldn’t \nnotice in the mirror. But ultimately, because of the relationship between strength gain and muscle \ngain, the main metric I want you to use for tracking your progress is strength. If you’re getting \nstronger, you’re progressing. It is strongly recommended to log every workout either in writing (print \nthe program out or use a separate notebook) or in an app, so you don’t have to rely on memory to \nkeep track of personal strength records. Taking body measurements a few times a year can also be \nhelpful (arms, thigh, waist, neck) but simply focusing on steady strength progression will be your \nbest proxy for determining muscular progress.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n24\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nHow much muscle can I expect to gain?\n\nHow you respond to training will be largely determined by genetic factors, your specific training \nhistory (i.e. how close you are to your genetic limit), and whether or not you are in a caloric surplus. \nAs a rough ballpark estimate for untrained male individuals in a 20-25% surplus above maintenance \ncalories, 1-2 lbs of muscle gain per month is reasonable (12-24 lbs of muscle gained in your first \nyear). For early intermediates with about 1 year of lifting experience in a 15-20% surplus, progress \nwill likely slow down to roughly 0.5-1 lbs of muscle gain per month (6-12 lbs of muscle gained in \nyour second year). For intermediate-advanced trainees in a 10-15% surplus, 0.25-0.5 pounds of \nmuscle gain per month is reasonable (three to six pounds of muscle gained per year). For practical \npurposes, women can divide muscle gain estimates in half.\n\n\nWhat gym training gear should I use?\n\nGym gear is optional, as there are no required pieces of equipment to gain muscle and increase \nstrength. With that being said, investing in some chalk or liquid chalk, a 10mm prong or lever belt, \nknee sleeves, squat shoes, and straps can be beneficial in allowing you to lift more weight for \ncertain exercises.\n\nI will most often use a lifting belt for hard working sets on the squat, bench press, deadlift and \noverhead press. I wouldn’t recommend wearing a belt on light warm-up sets or isolation exercises. I \nwill use knee sleeves on squat variations and (more optionally) leg press. Chalk and straps can be \nvery useful for improving grip issues on your deadlift and rows. However, keep in mind that straps \ncan become a crutch for poor grip strength if overused. I don’t recommend wearing straps on warm-\nup sets for this reason. Many people find that an elevated squat shoe can help them get deeper on \nsquats (especially when ankle mobility is limited) and can often improve strength via increased \nstability.\n\nYou can find most of my recommended equipment at the following affiliate link: http://Rise.ca/jeff\n\n\nI am not getting sore from my workouts. Is the program not working?\n\nMuscle soreness is largely attributed to eccentric contractions [5] and long muscle length \ncontractions [6]. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) isn’t required for hypertrophy to occur, but \nthe associated muscle damage might play a role in hypertrophy [7]. With that said, the main goal of \nthe program is to establish a strength foundation, not to get you feeling sore. In fact, reduced \nsoreness over time indicates that your body is adapting and recovering, which is actually a good \nthing for continued progress.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n25\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nI am getting very sore from my workouts. Should I skip the gym until I am not sore?\n\nYou may experience increased soreness when you first begin the program because it’s presenting a \nnew stress to your body. Foam rolling can help reduce DOMS [8] and increase ROM [9], so if you’re \nconsistently getting sore week after week, consider adding a short 3-5 minute foam rolling routine at \nthe end of the workouts. Otherwise, training while sore is not inherently problematic for muscle \ngrowth, unless it puts you at an increased risk of injury. If you’re having a difficult time getting into \nposition for any of the planned exercises, or finding it difficult to complete a full ROM due to pain, it \nwould be wise to skip that exercise until you feel properly recovered. Otherwise, in the case of mild \nsoreness, perform a slightly longer warm-up for each exercise and use your own discretion with \navoiding injury being a top priority. One extra rest day will not set you back very far, but a serious \ninjury will.\n\n\nShould I eat in a caloric deficit, maintenance, or surplus while running this program?\n\nEating in a slight (10-20%) caloric surplus will yield the best results and best recovery. However, if \nyour main goal is fat loss, eating in a caloric deficit will be necessary. As a beginner to intermediate \nlifter, you can continue to make strength and size progress while in a moderate caloric deficit and \nachieve body recomposition (lose fat and build muscle at the same time), if protein intake is \nsufficient (0.8-1g/lb bodyweight as a ballpark).\n\n\nThe warm-up isn’t enough for me. Can I add to it?\n\nYou can add warm-up exercises to the protocol, but this will of course add to the length of each \nsession. Your warm-up shouldn’t take any longer than 10-15 minutes. It is important to stay injury-\nfree, so don’t rush into your workout.\n\n\nWhy is there such little exercise variation from week to week?\n\nChanging exercises from week to week is more likely to flatten out the strength progression curve. \nWithin each block, exercises are kept constant to ensure both progression (by adding volume \nincrementally to these specific movements) and mastery of exercise form and technique.\n\n\nWhat do I do after I finish the program?\n\nYou have the option of running back through the same program again for another 12 weeks, trying \nout one of the other training splits available on my website, or you could move on to an entirely new \nprogram. Feel free to contact my coaching team if you would like some suggestions or guidance \nmoving forward.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n26\nQ:\nQ:\nQ:\nA:\nA:\nA:\nWhat are the blank boxes in the middle of each program for?\n\nThey are for you to track your weights each week, enabling you to focus on strength progression. \nYou can print out the program itself, pencil in your lifts into a notebook, or use a tracking app. \nKeeping up with this habit of tracking is going to be an extremely important part of your success \nwith this program.\n\n\nShould I add cardio to this program?\n\nThe main point of cardio from a bodybuilding standpoint is to create or increase a caloric deficit for \nfat loss. I would recommend prioritizing the deficit from your diet first, rather than relying heavily on \ncardio immediately for fat loss.\n\nAs a general rule, I recommend keeping cardio to an effective minimum on this program. If you wish \nto do cardio to achieve your fat loss goals or for general health and fitness, try to keep it to a \nmaximum of four low-moderate intensity sessions per week, around 30 minutes in duration. High \nintensity cardio should be used more sparingly, up to once or twice weekly at your own discretion.\n\n\nWhat does A1 and A2 mean before an exercise?\n\nThis indicates a superset should be performed. Do not rest after completing the first set of the A1 \nexercise and move right into the first set of the A2 exercise. Then rest for the time period indicated in \nthe A2 row.\nPlease direct all other questions to my coaching team through the contact form on my website. Please avoid directing questions about this \nprogram to my social media, as it is not a reliable means of making contact with me.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n27\n28\nwarm up\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nBefore we look at exactly how you should warm-up, it’s important to consider what the warm-up portion of \nyour training session serves to accomplish. Warming up should function to increase your core body \ntemperature, which improves performance [10, 11]. Your circadian rhythm also helps determine your core body \ntemperature at any given point in time. When you wake up, your core body temperature is at its lowest, and it \nincreases throughout the day. There seems to be a “sweet spot” for core body temperature, so doing 5-10 \nminutes of low-moderate intensity cardio is especially prudent if you exercise early in the morning [12].\n\nSecondly, warm-ups serve as a way to increase muscle activation. Doing dynamic warm-ups (exercises and \ndrills which take you through a range of motion) can improve performance and force output [13]. Don’t view \nyour warm-up as just “going through the motions.” The goal is to always be very mindful about the muscles \nyou are contracting and the bodily movements you’re doing. A proper and complete warm-up helps strengthen \nthis mindfulness.\n\nBelow is a general warm-up that should be completed prior to every workout:\nExercise-Specific Warm-Up\n\nAfter your general warm-up, how you warm up for your working sets will vary depending on which phase of the \nprogram you are running and which exercise you are doing. In the program sheets, next to each exercise you \nwill see a column for “warm-up sets” and “working sets”. For most exercises you’ll be doing 1-3 warm-up sets \nbefore beginning your hard working sets. These serve the purpose of getting blood flowing to the joints and \nmuscles you’ll be using on that exercise and helping you select the appropriate weight for your working sets.\n29\nExercise\nLow Intensity Cardio\nFront/Back Leg Swing\r\n(leg days only)\r\nSide/Side Leg Swing\n(leg days only)\r\nArm Swings\nCable External Rotation\nFoam Rolling\n(optional)\nN/A\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n~5 min\n12\n12\n12\n15\n0-3 min\nPick any machine which elevates \nyour heart rate to 100-135 BPM\n12 each leg\n12 each leg\nSwing your arms out to the sides\n15 each side\nFoam roll large muscle groups: \nquads, lats, calves\nSets\nReps/Time\nNotes\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nIf you are running Phase 1 or 2 of the program, follow this exercise-specific warm-up:\n\nMost exercises will require that you do an exercise-specific warm-up. This part of the warm-up is simply \nintended to get you used to performing the exercise and get a feel for what the weights feel like on that given \ntraining day. In the program, there is a distinction between warm-up sets and working sets. The warm-up sets \nare meant to be light and easy. The working sets are meant to be more challenging and should be taken much \ncloser to failure.\n\nMost exercises are listed as needing 0-3 warm-up sets. Here are some examples of how to go about warming \nup for those, depending on how many warm-up sets are listed.\n\nFor exercises that list 1 warm-up set:\nFor exercises that list 2 warm-up sets:\nLastly, for an exercise that lists 3 warm-up sets:\nUse approximately 60% of the weight you'll be using for the working sets for your warm-up set (do \nthe same number of reps as listed for the working sets)\nFor example, if you're planning on using 50 lbs for 8 reps, your warm-up set would be about 30 lbs \nfor 8 reps\nThen, begin your working sets\nPerform a mini-pyramid\nFor your first warm-up set, use approximately 50% of the weight you plan to use for the working \nsets (for the same reps as the working sets)\nFor your second warm-up set, use about 70% (for a few less reps than the working sets)\nFor example, if you were planning on using 50 lbs for 12 reps, I would use 25 lbs for 12 reps as my \nfirst warm-up set and then 35 lbs for 8 reps as my second warm-up set.\nThen, begin your working sets\nPerform a full warm-up pyramid\nFor your first warm-up set, use approximately 45% of the weight you plan to use for the working \nsets (for the same reps as the working sets)\nFor your second warm-up set, use around 65% (for a few less reps than the working sets)\nFor your third warm-up sets, finish with about 85% (for a few less reps still)\nFor example, if you were warming up to 100 lbs for 10 reps, go from 45 lbs for 10 reps to 65 lbs \nfor 7 reps to 85 lbs for 5 reps.\nThen, begin your working sets.\n30\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nIf you are running Phase 3 of the program, follow this warm-up:\n\nBecause this is a high rep phase, you will be using light weights for almost all exercises. Not all exercises \nrequire warm-up sets because the weight is so light. However, in the circumstances where warm-up sets are \nprescribed, they should be carried out as follows:\n\nKeep in mind, there is no exact formula for performing warm-up sets. It really is just a matter of finding a \nbalance between feeling \"primed\" for the working sets, while not needlessly fatiguing yourself with something \nthat is just meant to be a warm-up. You can feel free to adjust the above guidelines as needed. The goal with a \nwarm-up is to get the blood flowing to the target muscle and get you ready to train hard for the working sets. \nWarm-up sets are not building muscle. No need to overdo or over-think them.\nIf you are doing a set for 15-20 reps:\nIf you are doing a set for reps less than 15:\ndo the 1-2 warm-up sets (as listed in the program) with approximately 50-70% of the weight you \nplan to use for your working weight for 5-10 reps. This is just to get comfortable with what weight \nyou should be using for your 15-20 rep working sets.\nSimply follow the same warm-up protocol as in Phase 1.\n31\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nUltimate PPL\nProgram\n32\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n1\nPhase 1 \nBase Hypertrophy\n(Moderate Volume, Moderate Intensity)\nWEEK 1\nDB Bulgarian Split \nSquat\nPause DB \nBulgarian Split \nSquat\n45° \nHyperextension\nGoblet Squat\nNordic Ham Curl\nStanding Calf \nRaise\nMachine Crunch\nHack Squat\nPause Hack Squat\nDB RDL\nDB Step-Up\nLying Leg Curl\nSeated Calf Raise\nCable Crunch\n~3-4 min\n~3-4 min\n~2-3 min\n~2-3 min\n~1-2 min\n~1-2 min\n~1-2 min\n8-9\n8-9\n8-9\n8-9\n9-10\n9-10\n9-10\n2-4\n5\n8-10\n10\n10-12\n10-12\n10-12\n1\n3-4\n2\n0\n3\n2\n2\n1\n3\n1\n4\n1\n3\n1\nSquat\nPause Squat (Back off)\nBarbell RDL\nWalking Lunge\nSeated Leg Curl\nLeg Press Toe Press\nDecline Plate-Weighted \nCrunch\nSit back and down, keep your upper back tight to the bar.\nDrop the weight by ~25% from your top set. 2 second pause.

Every exercise in the program has two \nsubstitution options to choose from, listed in order of preference. Feel free to switch out the original exercise \nfor either of these substitutions. Doing an exercise substitution could be because:\nFor all of the substitutions, exercises have been chosen that work the same muscle groups and a similar \nmovement pattern, so none of the sets, reps, RPE, or rest need to be adjusted. Simply perform the substitution \nexercise in place of the original exercise. If you don’t wish to perform any strength work for any of the \nexercises substituted for squats, bench presses, or deadlifts, you can simply set a low-end rep cap at 4 reps, \nas explained in question #1 of the FAQ section.\nYour gym doesn’t have the \nequipment to perform the \nprescribed exercise\nThe prescribed exercise predictably \ngives you pain, or\nYou simply prefer one of the \nsubstitution exercises.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n34\nProgram\nExplained\n35\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nProgram Periodization\n\nIn this section, I will outline how the program is set up in terms of the phases, the split, autoregulation, \nprogression, and exercise selection.\nPhase 1: The Base Phase (Week 1-6)\n\nPhase 1 uses what could be called a more “bread and butter” push/pull/legs setup. It uses moderate volume \nand moderate-high intensity to set a foundation of hypertrophy. We’ll be doing 6-8 exercises per workout, 2-4 \nworking sets per exercise, mostly in the 10-12 rep zone (plus some low rep strength sets and some high rep \nmetabolic work). Most sets on the compound lifts are being pushed to an RPE of 8-9 (meaning we’ll be leaving \n1-2 reps in the tank) and most sets on the isolation exercises are being pushed to an RPE of 9-10 (meaning \nabout 1 rep shy of failure, if that). There is plenty of exercise variation and advanced intensity techniques in \nthe base phase to help stimulate hypertrophy right out of the gate.\nT H E  P H A S E S\n\nThis program is broken up into 3 very distinct phases, each with its own specific parameters and goals.\nPhase 1\nVolume\nIntensity\nPhase 2\nPhase 3\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n36\nPhase 2: The Maximum Effort Phase (Week 7-10)\n\nPhase 2 will look very different for those accustomed to my other \ntraining programs and utilizes a unique training style that borrows \nprinciples from the AST Max-OT training philosophy and High Intensity \nTraining as outlined by Mike Mentzer and popularized by 6x Mr. \nOlympian, Dorian Yates.\n\nPhase 2 uses low volume and ultra-high intensity. In this shorter 4 week \ntraining phase, we’ll be doing just 4-5 exercises per workout, 1-2 \nworking sets per exercise and 4-6 reps or 6-8 reps on every set. Nearly \nevery single working set (not warm-up sets) of every single exercise will \nbe pushed to an RPE of 10, meaning you use maximum effort on each \nset. It’s not necessary to actually fail on every set (where you have to \ndump the weight), but rather get to a point where you could not \npossibly complete another rep with reasonable technique. Note that for \nthe squat and bench work, we won’t be going to a true maximum effort \nso that recovery is not overtaxed for the rest of the workout.\n\nThe purpose of this phase is two-fold\u0000\u0005( To familiarize yourself with what true maximum effort and true \nfailure really feels like(\n ( To ensure progressive overload through the use of lower reps and \nrelatively heavy weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3: The Supercompensation Phase (Week 11-12)\n\nPhase 3 is the highest volume phase of the program and is strategically timed to come after the low volume \nsecond phase. This sudden increase in volume will provide a massive new stimulus for growth, something \nreferred to as “supercompensation” in sports science. While there is evidence showing that hypertrophic \nsupercompensation does occur, it is still largely based on theoretical frameworks. However, despite a relative \nwant for more evidence, supercompensated growth clearly does occur, especially when a novel training \nstimulus is introduced or training parameters are drastically increased.\n\nPhase 3 uses ultra-high volume and moderate-high intensity. In this short, 2-week training phase, we’ll be \ndoing 6-8 exercises per workout, 2-4 working sets per exercise, and 15-20 reps on most sets. This is a very \nhigh rep training phase that will challenge muscular endurance, leading to massive pumps and tons of muscle \ncell swelling. Most sets will be pushed to an RPE of 8-10, meaning sets are taken very close to the point of \nfailure. This is important so that adequate levels of tension are reached in the largest, highest-threshold \nmuscle fibers. If we stop too shy of failure, especially when doing high reps, we risk understimulating the \nmuscle for growth, even if the pump is incredible. This is where we’ll need to put our freshly sharpened \nfamiliarity with failure from Phase 2 to use. It is no longer necessary to go to truly max effort, but it’s still \nimportant to get very close.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n37\nDeload (Week 13)\n\nAfter the brutal 4-week max effort phase and 2-week high volume phase, it’s time for a deload. In Week 13, we \nwill be reducing both volume and intensity from the previous weeks. Because Week 13 follows the same \nexercise scheme as Weeks 11 and 12, we will also be reducing the rep ranges to allow for better recovery.\n\nAfter completing the deload, you will be in a good position to run back through the program again, starting at \nWeek 1 or moving on to one of my other programs, such as my High Frequency Full Body Program or Upper/\nLower Program.\n\nT H E  S P L I T\n\nThe objective of each program is to combine an optimized \nhypertrophy-focus with a minimalistic strength-focus. \nThere are 6x/week, 5x/week, and 4x/week versions of this \nprogram available. Depending on how many times per \nweek you are available to train, the split will be slightly \ndifferent. The 6x/week version uses the traditional Push/\nPull/Legs split with one rest day per week, the 5x/week \nuses a Push/Pull/Legs/Upper/Lower split with 2 rest days \nper week, and the 4x/week uses a Legs/Push/Pull/Full \nBody split with 3 rest days per week.\n\nImportantly, each split still maintains Push/Pull/Legs \nworkouts within each week. These workouts allow us to \nfocus on a small set of complementary muscle groups, so \nwe are able to add in more advanced training techniques \nand new exercise variations, while still maintaining a 2x/\nweek frequency for the major muscle groups and ensuring \nadequate recovery in between sessions.\n\nEach split will go through the same three phases as just \ndiscussed, although, the volume will be slightly lower with \nthe reduced frequencies. This means that the 6x split has \nslightly more volume than the 5x program, and the 5x \nprogram has slightly more volume than the 4x program. If \nyou find yourself struggling to recover from the training \nsessions, it’s worth considering switching to a lower \nfrequency in order to provide yourself with an additional \nrest day and reduce the recovery demand of the program \nitself (i.e. reduce the training volume).\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n38\nT H E  A U T O R E G U L AT I O N\n\nAutoregulation is when you make some choices about your training during your workout, rather than having \neverything locked into place before your workout. If you’re new to autoregulation, it may sound like a technical \nconcept, but it’s actually very simple. If you’ve ever done a few extra reps because you were feeling good or \ntook an extra minute of rest to recover after a tough set, then you’ve already used autoregulation in your \ntraining. It essentially just means “adjusting on the fly.”\n\nAutoregulation doesn’t mean you get to completely go by feel and suddenly have an excuse to totally sandbag \nyour workouts on bad days. Instead, it can be seen as leveraging the fact that performance will differ from day \nto day.\n\nWhen running a fixed program, on a day that you’re feeling extremely strong and performing extremely well, \nyou might be confined to doing work that is well below your potential for that day. That’s wasted potential. On \nan autoregulated program, however, if you’re feeling particularly strong on one day, you have the freedom to go \nheavier than usual. The same thing applies for days that you’re not feeling as strong, you have the permission \nto use weights that match your abilities on that specific day.\n\nThis isn’t just something I do because it seems intuitively appealing. Research consistently shows that an \nautoregulated approach results in better strength gains [15-17]. Remember, autoregulation doesn’t mean just \ntossing in the towel when you’re having a bad day. Instead, these studies use techniques, such as tracking bar \nvelocity loss, to allow more informed and structured adjustments to be made. And while most of us don’t have \naccess to a bar velocity tracker, luckily there are several other methods that don’t require any equipment and \nstill offer better results than a fixed program [15, 16]. That brings us to the main way that autoregulation will be \nused in this program: RPE.\nR P E\n\nRPE stands for Rating of \nPerceived Exertion and ranks \nhow hard a set was on a scale \nof 1-10. This table, adapted \nfrom the MASS Research \nReview should help clarify \nwhat each RPE value means.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n39\nTable 1: Resistance Training-specific RIR-Based Scale\nRPE Score\nRIR/Description\n10\n9.5\n9\n8.5\n8\n7.5\n7\n5-6\n3-4\n1-2\nMaximal Effort\nNo RIR, but could increase load\n1 RIR\nDefinitely 1, maybe 2 RIR\n2 RIR\nDefinitely 1, maybe 3 RIR\n3 RIR\n4-6 RIR\nLight Effort\nLight to no Effort\nThe goal is to select a weight that you can use for all of the working sets that will have you hitting the \nprescribed RPE on the last set. This means that it’s very likely that your first couple sets will be easier than the \ntarget RPE. For example, if you're performing 3 sets and the prescribed RPE is 8, it is normal and expected that \nyour first set will be closer to a 6 RPE, since the sets will get harder as you go. Of course, if the weight you've \nselected is clearly too light or too heavy, feel free to adjust the weight for the next set.\nDue to the subjectiveness of the RPE scale, and to allow for built-in wiggle-room for prescribed effort levels, \nthis program features RPE ranges for many lifts, rather than concrete values. The purpose of this is to provide \nmore constructive feedback on if you are using an appropriate weight for these lifts. Similar to other lifts, the \ngoal for these will be to select a weight that puts you within this range on the last set. This means that if the \nprescribed RPE is 7-8 and you hit failure on the last set, you will want to adjust the weight for that lift down. On \nthe other hand, if you reach a 7, 7.5, or 8 RPE on the last set, you can be confident that you selected an \nappropriate weight.\n\nUsing RPE, on days that you’re performing well, you can push heavier than normal. On days that you aren’t \nfeeling as strong, you can train lighter but still reach the appropriate effort threshold. Obviously, RPE is not \nintended to be used as an excuse to train light all the time, and it is still important to keep yourself \naccountable and progressing overall.\n\nRemember, for autoregulation to be effective, you need to actually autoregulate. This means a you need to pay \nattention to how you’re feeling that day, notice how the warmups move and then make an educated decision \nabout what weight you should load for your top set. Again, there is no shame in using a lighter load on days \nwhere your performance is clearly not at 100 percent. As long as you’re honest with yourself, a day will come \nwhen you feel at 100 percent again very soon, and because you had the wherewithal to hold back when \nappropriate, you will be recovered and ready for when the timing feels right for a push.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n40\nT H E  P R O G R E S S I O N\n\nMany exercises within the program have a rep range, rather than a fixed number of reps that you have to aim \nfor each week. Ideally, you would progress by adding reps with the same weight until you reach the top end of \nthe rep range. Once you reach the top end of the range, you would add some minimum amount of weight and \nstart back at the bottom of the range again.\n\nIn Phase 2 of the program, progressive overload is especially important. Because most exercises use a 4-6 rep \nrange, it’s worth emphasizing exactly how you should progress through these rep ranges.\nOn some exercises, especially in Phase 1 and 3, it will be impossible to add reps and/or weight every week \nbecause it will be impossible to maintain good form by the end of the program. Therefore, the main goal of \nthese exercises is simply to make an effort to do something better from week to week. This can be any of the \nfollowing:\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n41\nFor your working sets, choose a weight that will have you reaching maximum effort within 4-6 reps\nIf you hit 4 or 5 reps, aim to add a rep next week\nIf you hit 6 reps, add some weight next week\nAny time you hit 6 reps, that means it’s time to add some weight (assuming you used reasonably good \ntechnique)\nThe same progression outlined above should be used in cases where 6-8 reps are prescribed as well.\nIncreasing either rep(s) or weight;\nImproving technique (such as by controlling the tempo better than last time); or\nImproving the mind-muscle connection (such as by “squeezing” the target muscle harder than last time)\nT H E  E X E R C I S E  S E L E C T I O N \r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, this program \nplaces a heavy emphasis on having the \nflexibility to switch out exercises. For all of \nthe substitutions, exercises have been \nchosen that work the same muscle groups \nand a similar movement pattern, so none of \nthe sets, reps, RPE, or rest need to be \nadjusted. Simply perform the substitution \nexercise in place of the original exercise. If \nyou don’t wish to perform any strength work \nfor any of the exercises substituted for \nsquats, bench presses or deadlifts, you can \nsimply set a low-end rep cap at 4 reps, as \nexplained in question #1 of the FAQ section.\nExercise Video \nDemonstrations\n42\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\nRather than having a list of exercise videos in this program, every exercise is a clickable link to allow for a \nmore seamless experience. This means that all of the exercise videos are on the program pages themselves \nand all you have to do is click on the exercise name to open them.\nTHE ULTIMATE PUSH PULL LEGS SYSTEM\n43\nLEG PRESS\nGOBLET SQUAT\nWALKING LUNGE\ncomment from jeff\nFor customer support please visit                                                     \n                                              As much as I love \nconnecting on social media, I am not able to \nreliably respond to the questions I receive across \nplatforms so please direct any questions to the \nemail above.

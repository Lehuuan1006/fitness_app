    "text": "Why Bodyweight Training?\n \nYou might be wondering why bodyweight training is so good or why\nanyone would consider it when they could just join a gym. Well, I want to\ntake this chapter to address why bodyweight training is so incredible and\nhow it can change your life.\nI want to mention that I don’t have any issues with gyms, in fact, I love\nworking out in a gym, but I also love having the flexibility to work out\nanywhere. Whether it’s at home, work, whilst travelling, or out in the local\npark. The flexibility to exercise efficiently and effective anywhere is\nincredibly freeing.\nBut now I want to just note down some of the reasons you are going to love\nbodyweight training and dive into them a little deeper.\nWorkout Anywhere & Anytime\n \nGiven that bodyweight training simply uses your body, you can literally\nworkout anywhere you are, with no equipment. This is incredibly freeing as\nyou are no longer tied down to your gym's location.\nI know you live a busy a life and sometimes you just don’t have the time to\ntravel to the gym, get in a workout, and make it home in the time you have\navailable. With bodyweight training this is never an issue again – all you\nneed is a small amount of floor space. Plus, there is no need to factor in an\nextra 30 minutes for commuting back and forth. And if you still want to\nwork out at your gym, well as you’re taking your body to the gym, you can\ndo bodyweight training there, and what’s awesome is that you’ll never need\nto wait on a machine to free up again.\nOnce you adopt bodyweight training you will start to notice that you almost\nnever miss a workout. This is due to the fact that you’ve removed multiple\npsychological barriers for not exercising. You’ve also removed the common\nexcuses people tout for not being able to work out. You will never hear\nyourself say, “It’s too wet outside to go to the gym,” “The gym is always\ntoo busy at this time,” or “I’ve only got 30 minutes to spare, I can’t get to\nthe gym and workout in this time.” Nope, with bodyweight training you’ve\ncompletely eliminated these excuses and you will find yourself never\nmissing a workout.\nGet the Abs You Always Wanted\n \nWhen you go through a bodyweight training regime like this one, you will\nsee your abs appear faster than you thought possible. Bodyweight routines\nare highly metabolic in nature and also engage your core in almost every\nexercise. This means that as you go through the routine you are consistently\nstrengthening your core whilst shredding fat from your belly.\nCombine these two factors with an excellent eating plan (coming up soon)\nand you will be showing off your new 6 pack quicker than you would have\nimagined.\nAnd, if you want to speed up the process of getting washboard abs, make\nsure you download your free gift. Inside are recipes that will carve our your\nabs faster than you thought possible. Click here to download it now.\n \nStop the Injury Cycle\n \nNowadays it seems like having an injury is in vogue, and I’m not talking\nabout a serious injury such as torn rotator cuff, I mean those small twinges\nand pains people get in their knees, shoulders and elbows.\nI’m sure you know what I mean and if you don’t, just carry out a little\nobservation next time you’re at the gym. Watch somebody doing the chest\npress, after they rack the weight watch them as the rotate their shoulder and\nstretch it out with a grimace on their faces.\nThese little injuries are so incredibly common it’s ridiculous and they all\nstem from one of the following: trying to lift too much weight, poor form\nand under developed stabilizing muscles from overusing machines.\nBodyweight training helps to solve all these problems.\nYou won’t be attempting to lift stupidly heavy weights that are purely to\nstroke your ego. Instead you will be using strategically designed lifting time\nframes to work the muscles just as hard as if you had loaded the barbell\nwith plate after plate.\nAs bodyweight exercises incorporate a huge number of your stabilizer\nmuscles, you will be strengthening these every workout and preventing\nfuture injury, as well as building muscle.\nThe above points merge into the fact that with bodyweight routines you will\nnot be lifting under poor form. Most people give up good form in their\nattempts to continually stack plates onto the bar. With bodyweight training\nyou won’t have the opportunity to do this. Throw in the continued\ndevelopment of your stabilizer muscles and you will always be exercising\nunder excellent form.\nBuild Lean, Hard Muscle While Burning Fat\n \nThere is a common misconception that in order to build muscle and lose fat\nyou must have a gym membership, along with this goes the fact that you\nmust take every supplement under the sun. Well, guess what… this is just\nmarketing doing what it does best, convincing you of something in order to\nextract money from you.\nThe truth is, yes gyms are good and yes supplements are good, but you need\nneither.\nIn order to get in truly phenomenal shape you only need to do the\nfollowing:\nBreak your muscles down and then rebuild them with proper nutrition.\nThat’s it. You don’t need a fancy piece of equipment or supplements X,Y,\nand Z.\nBy properly utilizing your bodyweight you will be placing your body in the\ncorrect environment to prime it for muscle growth. And as you work\nthrough this program you will be doing very specific things in order to\nplace your body in the correct environment.\nAs I mentioned earlier, bodyweight training is highly metabolic, but that’s\nnot the only way you will be losing fat. As this program will be helping you\nbuild muscle you will also lose fat as a direct result of having more muscle.\nIncreasing the amount of lean muscle on your body will increase your\nmetabolism and testosterone levels – both of which are proven to decrease\nthe amount of fat your carry.\nSave Money\n \nIf you’re working out at home, the office, or your local park, one thing is\ngoing to remain constant –you will be saving money. No spending money\non gas to get to the gym, no pricey gym memberships, no extortionate\npersonal trainers.\nAgain, I’m not saying you have to quit your gym, but if money is tight and\nyou still want to get in brilliant shape, then feel free to quit the gym and\npocket that extra $50 per month.\n \nBuilding The Body You Want\n \nEach of us have specific goals and body re-composition targets we want to\nhit. We all have that image in our head of how we want our bodies to look.\nWe’ve seen the celebrity we want to look like and we have set some sort of\nrough date that we want to achieve it by.\nHaving these visions and goals is crucially important to your success in any\nnew fitness regime. If you don’t have the end goal in sight you won’t have\nthe motivation and drive to reach the finish line.\nBefore you start this program, I want you to answer some very simple\nquestions and write the answers to them down. Doing this will help to\nclarify your goals and set them in stone. Understanding your motivations is\none of the most important steps you can take in order to reach the\nsuccessful conclusion of any goal.\nSo, before you get started on the program work your way through the\nfollowing steps.\nSteps to Ensure Your Success\n \n- Write one specific sentence describing exactly how you want your body to\nlook.\nIs it lose 10lbs? Add 3 lbs of muscle? Tighten your stomach? Drop to single\ndigit body fat %? Your goals are personal to you so don’t let anyone else\ninfluence your decision, just write down what you personally want.\n- Find an image of the body you want to achieve and print it out, keep it\nsomewhere you will see it every day. \nDoing this is a powerful visualization exercise and will help keep you\nmotivated as you can now physically see your end goal.\n- Take a picture of your body.\nThroughout the program you are going to look at this image so you can see\njust how far you’ve came. Having an image of your body before you start\nthe program means you will have proof of progress and this will help to\nfurther motivate you throughout the journey.\n- Ask yourself why you are wanting to change your body and write the\nreasons down.\nDoing this helps you understand the rationale behind your desire to change\nand this is what you can focus upon if you ever want to quit. If you ever\nhave a day you want to give up then go back and read this statement.\nBy going through each of these quick steps you have drastically increased\nyour chances of success. By clarifying and visualizing your goals you will\nfind that you are much more motivated than you’ve ever previously been.\nNow that you have the end result in sight you just need an excellent\nprogram to follow and that’s what this book is going to provide for you.\nOh, and one last thing you can do to ensure your success is get your free\ncopy of the Your Body is Your Gym bonus pack.

Your diet and nutrition is just\nas important as the exercise you do.\nWithout a solid nutritional plan you will never get the body you want. I\ncannot emphasize the importance of proper nutrition in regards to health\nand fitness.\nNot only will it allow you to reach your body composition goals, but it will\nalso make you happier, help you sleep better, increase your testosterone,\nand improve almost every health marker we measure. Perhaps, more\nimportant than all those combined, is that it will help you live longer;\nsimply put, people who eat a healthy diet live longer.\nIn this program you will see results if you only follow the exercises, but in\norder to see incredible, life changing results I suggest you follow the\nprinciples I am going to lay out.\nThe following section is lifted from my #1 bestselling book, The 6 Pack\nChef.” The focus of this book was nutritional rules and recipes for rapidly\ncutting body fat to reveal your 6 pack. I have lifted out the nutritional rules\nfrom this book as they are the exact rules I suggest you follow whilst going\nthrough this program. I’ve also provided a few example recipes, if you want\nto see the full collection of recipes you can purchase, The 6 Pack Chef at\nAmazon.com. Additionally, as part of your free gift you also receive five\nmore ‘6 pack’ recipes, check out the front of the book for more details.\nExcerpt from The 6 Pack Chef\n \nNutritional Rules to Follow\nThis section will explore the various rules you have to follow in order to\nshred off fat and reveal your 6 pack. These rules are simple to follow and\nyou will most likely have come across some of them before.\n \nRead them carefully and follow them religiously. \n \nThe first few rules are all set around the famous (and very true) saying of,\n“Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym.”\n \nThe key to getting truly shredded is through the correct approach to diet. So\nwithout further ado, here are your nutritional rules.\n \nYou Have to Eat.\n \nIf you want to be lean and have a shredded 6 pack you have to eat. Starving\nyourself will just result in a loss of muscle, a screwed up metabolism and a\nmalnourished appearance. By eating you will be providing your body will\neverything it needs to burn fat, keep your metabolism working, feed your\nmuscles, and ultimately get shredded – but remember you need to eat the\nright foods, which brings us to rule 2.\n \nEat the Right Foods\n \nUnless you are a freak of nature or on steroids you won’t be able to get\nshredded by eating whatever you like. You need to base your diet around\nwhole foods and avoiding manufactured/processed foods. (Check out your\nfree gift for a shopping list of foods.)\n \nWhole foods can be considered anything that isn’t packed full of additives\nand came out of a factory. Sure the packet of cooked chicken at the grocery\nstore might boast 30g of protein, but look closer at the nutritional info and\nyou will see a long list of additives – these will prevent you ever getting\ntruly lean.\n \nConversely, eating natural whole foods (nuts, grass-fed beef, organic\nchicken, eggs, beans, legumes etc.) will give your body the nutrients it\nrequires to burn the stubborn fat hiding your abs.\n \nGoing 100% natural can be very difficult and is not essential, instead you\nshould aim for 80% whole-foods. This means you can still eat (in small\ndoses) things like hot sauces, certain breads etc. This 80/20 split will help\nyou stick to your diet, not go crazy, prevent cravings and save you money.  \n \n \nEvery Meal Must Have a Protein Source\n \nBeing shredded is not just about losing body fat, you also need to have a\nsubstantial amount of muscle. Lean muscle burns fat, the more muscle you\nhave the more fat you burn and the building block of muscle is protein.\n \nWhen you are on the quest to reveal your abs you will be in a calorie deficit\n(expending more calories than you take in) and when in a deficit protein\nwill carry out the following functions:\n \n- Keep you feeling fuller longer as protein aids satiety and prevents hunger.\n \n- Prevent muscle breakdown from calorie reduction.\n  \nEat Greens & Keep Fibre High\n \nThe fibre you get from green vegetables and carbs, such as legumes, have\nsome excellent health benefits which make them essential for getting\nshredded. Eating more fibre has been proven to help you control weight\nfluctuations, lose weight quicker, promote a healthier heart, and increase\nyour levels of satiety after a meal. Aim to eat some greens and fibre in\nevery meal. As you go through the recipes in this book, you will notice how\nmany of them call for these ingredients. \n \nDon’t Be Afraid of Fat\n \nIt seems counter intuitive, but eating fat helps you lose fat. Your body\nrequires fat to function, it’s a crucial building block, and ensuring you\nconsume dietary fat will help you reach your goals faster. The main foods\nyou want to derive your fats from are things like extra-virgin olive oil,\nsteak, beef, chicken thighs, and avocado.\n \nIf you limit your fat intake too steeply then your body will go into “survival\nmode” and not let go of its existing fat stores as it is concerned no more is\ncoming. Avoid this by accepting healthy dietary fats as an essential part of\nyour diet.\n \nResistance Training\n \nIf you want to reveal your abs, you need to place your muscles under\ntension. As mentioned in the previous rule muscle burns fat, but there are\nother reasons you need to lift if you want to reveal your 6 pack:\n \n- Resistance training is highly metabolic and torches fat.\n \n- Increases testosterone – higher T levels are directly linked to an increase\nin fat burning.\n \n- To build muscle, strength the core and increase the size of abdominal\nmuscles.\n \nTrain Fasted (if possible)\nIf your schedule allows for it train early in the morning in a fasted state.\nFasted state training has a plethora of benefits which will allow you to carve\nout your abs at an accelerated pace. The benefits of training early in the\nmorning are shown below:\n- Your testosterone levels are at their highest in the morning.\n- You prime your body to burn fat for the remainder of the day.\n- Any food you eat after working out will go straight to your muscles and\nnot have the opportunity to turn to fat.\nThe benefits of training fasted will now be listed:\n- Increase in production of HGH (human growth hormone).\n- Your body targets fat cells for energy as no food is available for fuel.\n- You will NOT have an insulin spike.\nThe first few times you train fasted will feel unusual, but by the 3rd or 4th\nsession you will notice an increase in energy levels and performance in the\ngym. I recommended a large black coffee or double espresso (no sugar,\ncream etc.) before the gym to help with your energy levels.\nEnsure you eat as soon as possible after your workout.\nRefuel Every 7-10 Days\nIn order to strip away body fat and reveal your abs, it is essential that you\nare in a caloric deficit the majority of the time. However, it is also crucial\nthat you ‘refuel’ every so often. A refuel day consists of greatly spiking\nyour caloric intake in order to achieve the following:\n- Reset your leptin levels.\n- Boosts your metabolism.\n- Replenish your glycogen stores.\nStop you losing your mind when cutting.\nA refuel day is very important to anyone wanting to reveal their abs, but\nseveral things should be noted about the day. Do not confuse it with a ‘cheat\nday,’ you will still be eating the same healthy foods, just in greater amounts.\nDo not eat for the sake of eating, just eat more each meal. If you need to eat\nsomething sweet for the sake of your sanity, be very careful with the portion\ncontrol.\nPlan your refuel days ahead of time, decide what you are going to eat ahead\nof time and make sure you enjoy the feeling of the increase protein, carbs,\nand fats pulsing through your body.\n \nExample Recipes\n \nThe full collection recipes can be found within, The 6 Pack Chef.

Well, I’ve very briefly mentioned earlier\nwhat the program will focus on, but I am now going to dive a little deeper\ninto it so that you know what to expect.\nThis program is specifically designed around using only your bodyweight\nto help you reach your goals.\nIt is laid out initially as an 8 week program, after that time you will have\nmade significant gains and if you’ve followed the program progression and\nnutritional structure to a tee you will see incredible results. After the initial\n8 weeks you can do a number of things: you can continue with the program,\nskipping the first several weeks, you can design your own bodyweight\nroutines or you can adopt any new practice you like. \nI’ve designed this program using a number of very specific strategies in\norder to accelerate your results by properly utilizing your body weight.\nThroughout the course of the program you will be using strategies such as\nprogressive overload, reduction of rest times, lactic acid training, and\nmuscle time under tension. Using these strategies in combination with\nhighly metabolic routines that focus on multi-muscle movements will result\nin spectacular results.\nIn the paragraph above I mentioned the concepts of progressive overload,\nlactic acid training, and time under tensions (TUT), I will now elaborate\nfurther as to what these are, why they’re so powerful and how they will help\nyou reach your goals.\nWhat is Progressive Overload?\nProgressive overload is the very simple concept of continually increasing\nthe demands you place upon your body in order to stimulate muscle growth.\nIf you do not continue to increase the work done by your muscles then they\nwill cease to grow.\nIf you want to increase muscle size and definition you must continue to\nbreak down your muscles by forcing them to do more work than previously\ndone. Doing this causes your muscles to adapt and grow, if you choose not\nto increase the loads your muscles are undergoing then your muscle has no\nreason to grow.\nNow the problem with most bodyweight programs is that increasing the\nload usually relates to increasing the weight you are using, and as your\nbodyweight is not going to massively increase these programs deliver poor\nresults.\nThis program is completely different as it delivers progressive overload\nwithout the use of dumbbells, weight machines or barbells. The reason this\nprogram can do this by utilizing two specific types of training – time under\ntension and lactic acid training.\nWhat is Time Under Tension Training?\nTime under tension or TUT is a very specific type of training that was\npopularized by Tim Ferriss in his book, The 4 Hour Body. I won’t go\ndeeply into the details and science behind how TUT works and will instead\njust give a brief overview so that you can understand the concept and how it\nis going to help you.\nTUT training relates to placing your muscles under stress for a specific\namount of time in order to break them down. The lifting and lowering\nphases in TUT are tightly controlled and executed slowly and steadily, this\ndiffers from conventional lifting which generally places the focus on\nmoving as much weight as possible through the desired motion, with no\nregards to lifting cadences.\nBut what are the benefits of TUT training?\nWell, first off by having your muscles be under tension for an extended\nperiod of time the result will be a greatly enhanced metabolic response and\nan increase in the release of growth hormone.\nSecondly, by strategically increasing the time muscles are under tension you\nwill be more effectively depleting your muscles glycogen (stored\ncarbohydrates) levels. This means that during your post-workout feeding\nwindow your muscles will be craving food, especially carbohydrates, in\norder to repair themselves and they will rapidly absorb it into your muscles\n– this means you can greatly increase muscle growth potential.\nThe above point also helps link to the next point which is fat loss. As TUT\ntraining places a great strain on muscle fibres it is highly metabolic, this\nmeans you will remain in a metabolic state for a massively increased length\nof time after your workout. This means that even when you’re not working\nout you are still burning off fat.\nWith this bodyweight program you will be able to progressively overload\nyour muscles without the need for gym equipment, instead you will simply\nuse time.\nStrategically increasing the stress your muscles are undergoing means that\nyou can continue to promote growth by continually overloading your\nmuscles and breaking down the fibres. This is one of the keys which will\nskyrocket your results over any other previous bodyweight program you’ve\ntried. No other bodyweight program utilizes strategies like TUT training\nand therefore gains plateau and results are poor.\nAdd in the final strategy you’re going to be using at different stages in this\nprogram and you have the cocktail for growth and this final strategy is\nlactic acid training.\nWhat is Lactic Acid Training?\nIn order to promote further progressive overload, fat loss, and incredible\nresults you will also be using lactic acid training. This is a style of exercise\nthat was popularized by the personal trainer and fitness model John\n‘Roman’ Romaniello.\nAgain, like with TUT training, I won’t go into the science behind lactic acid\ntraining and will instead give an overview providing you with exactly what\nyou need to know.\nLactic acid training is incredibly powerful when it comes to promoting fat\nloss without the loss of muscle and without the hindrance of preventing\nmuscle growth. The concept of this training is to promote higher production\nlevels of lactic acid within your muscles. If you’re not sure what lactic acid\nis then just think of that burning feeling you get deep in your muscles after\na few tough reps, that’s lactic acid, and we’re going to be ramping up the\nproduction of that. This style of training isn’t easy, but it is very beneficial.\nSo, how does lactic acid training work?\nThe ‘burn’ you’ve felt before is a result of your body using glycogen as an\nenergy source. As glycogen breaks down it becomes a variety of different\ncompounds and these compounds are the source of the ‘burn’ and they\ncreate lactic acid in your muscles.\nAs the levels of lactic acid increases, so too does your body’s release of\ngrowth hormone. This is the perfect environment for muscle gain and fat\nloss as growth hormone causes fat cells to turn to fuel and causes muscles\nto grow.\nSo when your body is producing more lactic acid, it is placing you in the\ncorrect environment for muscle growth and fat loss; throw in a solid diet\nplan and you will see results faster than you believed possible.\nBringing it all Together…\nAs mentioned above, when you bring all these aspects together into a\nstrategically designed program the results you will be able to see are great.\nEach stage of the program is designed so that your body is continually\nadapting, growing and changing.\nIn this next section I will give the structure of the program so you can see a\nweek-by-week guide as to what you will be undergoing.\n \nWeek by Week Program Overview\n \nThis outline will give you a more detailed overview to the bodyweight\nprogram I’ve designed for you. Each week builds upon the previous, getting\ntougher and introducing new strategies. This ensures that you are\ncontinually progressing and forcing your body to adapt, build muscle, and\nshred fat.\nWithin each week of the program the weekly introduction will give further\ndetails on the strategies you will be using, it will also provide rep ranges,\nrest times, tension times, lifting cadences, and much more.\nEach week has 4 exercise sessions and how you split these is up to you,\nhowever, I would recommend the following structure over the course of 7\ndays.\n- Workout Day\n- Workout Day\n- Rest Day\n- Workout Day\n- Rest Day\n- Workout Day\n- Rest Day\nI would not suggest working more than this as resting is incredibly\nimportant for body re-composition, it seems counterintuitive, but in order to\ngrow and lose fat you need to stop working and allow the body to repair\nitself.\nThe Week by Week Structure\nThere is an option for either a beginner or intermediate/advance program.\nChoose the one which is best suited to your body type and current fitness\nlevels. If you’ve never worked out before, or haven’t in years, then do not\nattempt the intermediate/advance program – you will fail. The programs are\nvery similar with key alterations having been made within each week to\nbest suit the target group. \nWeeks 1-2\nThe first phase of the program is focused upon priming your body for the\nnext 6 weeks of intensity. Each workout is designed to prime your muscles\nfor the strategies you will be using in subsequent weeks.\nWeeks 3-4\nIn this phase we will be introducing time under tension training to the\nequation, you will now understand the intensity that comes along with\nconstant muscle tension and see why you never need a gym again. Each\nweek will reduce rest times and increase tension times to ensure progressive\noverload.\nWeeks 5-6\nIn this phase we will be introducing lactic acid training to the equation.\nLactic acid training will shock your muscles as you will never have\nexperienced anything like this before. During this phase you will be\nramping up your fat loss potential due to the production of mass amounts of\nlactic acid and the metabolic nature of the workouts.\nWeek 7\nA return to time under tension training. Week 7 will be a direct repeat of\nweek 4 in terms of exercises performed but the difference will come from\nthe rest times and lifting times.\nWeek 8\nA return to lactic acid training. Week 8 will be a direct repeat of week 6 in\nterms of exercises performed but the difference will come from the rest\ntimes and lifting times.\n \n \n \nThe Movements\n \nHey, sorry for the interruption…\nBut just want to check that you download the free gift that comes with this\nbook.\nThe ‘Your Body is Your Gym’ Bonus Pack\nThis bonus pack is the shortcut to your success with this book, and it’s\n100% free.\nInside your bonus pack you’ll get access to:\n-        Recipes for supercharging your results\n-        An extra Ab Blaster workout routine\n-        Your 6 Pack Food Grocery List\nCheck it out.

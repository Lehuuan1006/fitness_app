For exam-\nple, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need more\nof most nutrients.  The Food and Nutrition Board of the\nInstitute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, a\ngroup of nutritional scientists from the United States and\nCanada, has established the Dietary Reference Intakes\n(DRIs), a set of recommendations for nutrient intake.  The\nDRIs are age- and sex-specific.  With the exception of fats\nand carbohydrates (whose requirements depend only on\nour calorie needs), a separate DRI is set for each of the\nknown nutrients for each of 10 different age groups.  From\nthe age of 9 years, males and females have separate DRIs,\nand additional DRIs are set for women who\nare pregnant or breastfeeding.  \nHow did the nutrient recom-\nmendations originate? Concerned\nwith the need to provide proper\nnutrition for newly drafted\nWorld War II soldiers, many of\nwhom were undernourished, the\nDepartment of Defense commissioned\nthe first set of nutrient recommendations\n(called the Recommended Dietary Allowances)\nin 1941.  Since then, nutrient recommendations\nW\ne are surrounded by a vast array of foods to eat and\nactivities to pursue.  Every day we make choices\namong those foods and activities based on our cultural\nbackground, knowledge, experiences, and goals.  Each\nchoice may have an impact on our overall health and qual-\nity of life.  Our ancestors’ food choices were limited by\nwhat they could gather, catch, cultivate, and harvest.\nPhysical pursuits were determined by the work\nthat needed to be done.  Today, advances\nin agriculture, transportation, food\npreservation, and storage bring\nnearly every type of food from\nevery country of the world to\nour local supermarkets through-\nout the year.  With such a lim-\nitless array of foods, choosing\nthe ones that promote health is\neasier than ever, but making these\nchoices requires knowledge and\nmotivation.  This chapter explains\nhow the guidelines established by\nnationally recognized health and\nnutrition authorities can be used\nto help you understand the food\nchoices that promote health, choose\nthe foods that contain needed nutrients,\nand select appropriate serving sizes.\nhave undergone periodic revision based on advances in our\nunderstanding of nutrition.\nToday, nutrition research addresses not only the preven-\ntion of nutritional-deficiency diseases but also the role of\nnutrients in reducing the long-term risk for diseases such\nas heart disease and cancer.  Taking into consideration the\nresulting expansion of scientific knowledge about the roles\nof nutrients in health since the first recommendations were\nestablished, the latest revision was begun in 1997.  The new\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) include the Recommended\nDietary Allowance, the Estimated Average Requirement, the\nAdequate Intake, and the Upper Limit.\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the\namount of each nutrient that is sufficient to prevent nutri-\ntional deficiencies in practically all healthy people.  The\nEstimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the amount of a\nnutrient that is estimated to meet the requirement of half\nthe population of an age- and sex-specific group.  For some\nnutrients, too little is known about them to establish an\nRDA.  For these, an Adequate Intake (AI) is determined.\nThis is the intake that should be adequate to meet the\nneeds of most people.  A safe Upper Limit (UL) has been\nestablished for some nutrients.  Establishment of this value\nreflects our growing recognition that some nutrients may\nhelp promote health and prevent disease in amounts that\nexceed the RDA.  The UL is the maximal daily intake of a\nnutrient that is likely to be free of the risk of adverse health\neffects in almost all individuals in the designated group.  \nHow are the DRIs used?  They are the basis for all nutri-\ntional plans used by health care facilities and providers,\nfood services, food manufacturers, and others who plan\ndiets.  As you will learn below, the Food Guide Pyramid,\nthe research-based food guide developed by the govern-\nment, is based on the DRIs.  In addition, the Daily Values,\nthe information on food labels that helps you determine\nhow a food contributes to your total nutrient intake, are\nbased on the DRIs (see the Appendix:  Dietary Reference\nIntakes, page 421).\nAMERICA’S HEALTH GOALS\nAccording to recent statistics, our eating habits—the foods\nwe eat and drink and those we avoid—play a major role in\npreventing 4 of the 10 leading causes of death in the United\nStates.  These include heart disease, cancer, stroke, and\ndiabetes (see sidebar: Top 10 Causes of Death, this page).  In\naddition, one in four adults has high blood pressure, a\nleading contributor to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure,\nand premature death.  (See Chapter 3, page 47, for the\nimportant role of diet.)  We didn’t always have this knowl-\nedge.  But now that we do, experts in nutrition working\nwith the federal government have provided us with  nutri-\ntion and physical activity guidelines for staying healthy and\npreventing disease.\nMany government and health care associations focus\ntheir efforts on helping Americans eat well.  Chief among\nthem is the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices, which created a set of national health goals entitled\nHealthy People 2010.\nHealthy People 2010\nThe ultimate goals of Healthy People 2010 are to improve\nthe nation's health status and to eliminate health disparity\namong segments of the U.S. population.  One of the priori-\nties of this initiative is to foster a change in America's eating\n6\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nRANK\nCAUSE OF DEATH\n1†\nHeart disease\n2†\nCancer\n3†\nStroke\n4\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(emphysema)\n5‡\nAccidents/injuries\n6\nPneumonia and influenza\n7†\nDiabetes mellitus\n8‡\nSuicide\n9\nKidney disease\n10‡\nChronic liver disease, cirrhosis\n*Top 10 causes of death according to the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, 1997.\n†Causes of death in which diet plays a part.\n‡Causes of death in which excessive alcohol consumption plays \na part.\nTOP 10 CAUSES OF DEATH* (U.S. POPULATION)\nMany of the leading causes of death in the United States are\ndirectly related to diet and excessive alcohol consumption.\nhabits.  The primary means for achieving these goals is\nthrough various nutrition initiatives (see sidebar:  Healthy\nPeople 2010, above).\nMounting scientific evidence supports a link among\ndiet, health promotion, and disease prevention.  Improved\nnutrition has the potential to prevent or delay many diseases\noften associated with advancing age.  With prevention of\nillness comes the possibility of reducing health care costs.\nTherefore, one of the main nutrition objectives is to promote\nhealth and reduce chronic diseases associated with diet and\nobesity.  This includes reducing the number of people who\ndie of heart disease, reducing the number of cancer deaths,\nreducing the prevalence of overweight and diabetes, and\nreducing growth retardation in children.\nTo help achieve these health goals, specific nutrition\ntargets were set.  These include:\n• increasing the proportion of the population who are\nat a healthy weight\n• optimizing food and nutrient consumption, emphasiz-\ning fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\n• improving nutrition and nutrition education at\nschools and at worksites\n• including nutrition counseling as a regular part of\nhealth care\n• increasing access to a healthful and safe food supply\nCoalitions of government health agencies and the food\nindustry are working collaboratively to provide consistent\nmessages that emphasize the importance of eating a diet\nrich in plant foods—fruits, vegetables, and grains—and\ncontaining less fat (see Other Voices, page 14).\nFor example, the government has required that labels on\nfoods provide clear and concise information on nutrient\nChapter 1:  Optimizing Health\n7\nObjective:\nPromote health and reduce chronic diseases associated\nwith diet and weight\nWeight status and growth:\nIncrease proportion of people who are of healthy\nweight\nDecrease obesity in adults\nDecrease overweight or obesity in children and\nadolescents\nReduce growth retardation in children\nFood and nutrient consumption:\nIncrease fruit intake (2+ servings daily)\nIncrease vegetable intake (3+ servings daily)\nIncrease grain product intake (6+ servings daily)\nDecrease saturated fat intake (less than 10% of calories)\nDecrease total fat intake (no more than 30% of calories)\nFood and nutrient consumption (continued):\nDecrease sodium intake (2,400 milligrams or \nless daily)\nMeet dietary needs for calcium\nReduce iron deficiency and anemia\nSchools, worksites, and nutrition counseling\nMeals and snacks at school should contribute to overall\ndietary quality\nEmployers promote nutrition education and weight\nmanagement at the worksite or through health plans\nNutrition counseling for medical conditions\nInclude nutrition counseling in physician office visits\nFood security\nIncrease access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods\nfor an active, healthy life\nHEALTHY PEOPLE 2010\nOverall Health Goals:  Increase quality and years of healthy life and eliminate \nhealth disparities among different segments of the population\n*Nutrition and Overweight is one focus area (of 28) that targets interventions designed to increase quality and years of healthy life and\nto eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.\nFOCUS AREA:  NUTRITION AND OVERWEIGHT*\ncontent and truthful health claims based on scientific fact.\nThe food industry is developing healthier lower-fat and\nlower-calorie products, restaurants are identifying healthful\nchoices on menus, and educational efforts on the impor-\ntance of good nutrition have been stepped up.\n5 a Day for Better Health\nThe National Cancer Institute of the United States and\nthe Produce for Better Health Foundation (a nonprofit\nconsumer education foundation representing the fruit and\nvegetable industry) collaborated in a unique partnership\nin 1991 to develop the 5 a Day for Better Health program.\nThis is a nationwide educational effort to encourage\nAmericans to eat 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables\nevery day for better health.  A minimum of 5 servings of\nfruits and vegetables a day provides the RDA for many of\nthe vitamins and minerals (see Chapter 2, page  29).  The rec-\nommendation that we eat 5 to 9 servings of fruits and veg-\netables each day also is based on the results of numerous\nstudies showing the positive effects of fruits and vegetables\non health as a result of their ability to reduce the risk of can-\ncer and other diseases.  Ample consumption of fruits and\nvegetables forms the basis of some of the Dietary Guidelines\nfor Americans and the guidelines of the American Cancer\nSociety and others, outlined below.  The 5 a Day program\nworks through state public health departments, retail food\nstores, school classrooms and cafeterias, the military, and\nvarious media.  The goal of the program is to educate the\npublic about the benefits of fruits and vegetables and to\ndemonstrate easy and delicious ways to fit more of them into\nyour diet (see Chapters 4 and 5, pages 79 through 149).\nHave We Made Progress?\nThe explosion of health information and nutrition educa-\ntion programs has led to good progress on several fronts.\nDeaths from heart disease have declined and, to a slight\ndegree, so have deaths from some cancers.  On average,\nthe intake of total fat and saturated fat has decreased.  Food\nlabeling provides much more useful information now.\nRestaurants offer more low-fat and low-calorie options on\ntheir menus.\nAlthough consumption of grain products is on the rise,\nmany grains are in the form of snacks such as corn chips and\npopcorn.  Fewer than one-third of American children and\nless than one-half of adults eat the recommended 5 servings\nof fruits and vegetables.  Overall, fat intake is decreasing\n(from 40 percent of calories in the late 1970s to 33 percent\nin the mid-1990s).  However, only about a third of adults\nmeet the “30 percent or fewer calories from fat” recom-\nmendation of nutrition experts.\nNutritionists are now assessing our progress in meeting\nthe goals of Healthy People 2010.  These efforts will include\nevaluating healthful behaviors in the areas of fitness and\nnutrition, ensuring a safe food supply, and reducing and pre-\nventing diseases such as osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, heart\ndisease, and stroke.  \nOf course, national goals are met one person at a time.\nFortunately, there is a road map for achieving fitness and\nhealth.  Scientists and nutrition experts have mapped out\na sound plan for healthful eating and exercise based on the\nmost current findings about nutrition.  \nTHE DIETARY GUIDELINES\nFOR AMERICANS\nAim for Fitness\nAim for a healthful weight\nResearch clearly shows that being overweight greatly\nincreases your risk for many diseases, including heart dis-\nease, cancer, and diabetes.  If you are overweight, com-\nbining a healthful eating plan with regular physical activ-\nity is the most effective way to lose weight  and to sustain\n8\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nthe loss (see sidebar:  Diet and Exercise—The Perfect Pair,\npage 10).  If you are at a healthy weight, your goal is to\nmaintain that weight.  Chapter 3 (page 47) provides further\ninformation on weight control.\nBe physically active each day\nEveryone—young and old—can improve their health by being\nmore active.  Choose activities that you enjoy and can do reg-\nularly.  Although you will gain more health benefits with high-\nintensity exercise that lasts 30 minutes or more, low-to-mod-\nerate activities can be part of your routine.  For some people,\nthis means fitting more activity of daily living into your usual\nroutine.  This could include using the elevator less and using\nthe stairs more, parking farther from rather than closer to your\ndestination, gardening, or golfing without a cart.  For others,\na more structured program might be preferred, such as at a\nworksite or health club.  Whichever you choose, the goal is to\ninclude at least 30 minutes of activity every day.\nThe need for regular physical activity is so important\nthat the Surgeon General of the United States has issued a\nreport entitled Physical Activity and Health, which has its own\nguidelines for achieving activity.  They are the following:\n• Physical activity should be performed regularly.\nInclude a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate physical\nactivity (such as brisk walking) on most, if not all,\ndays of the week.  For most people, greater health\nbenefits can be obtained by engaging in activity that\nis more vigorous or of longer duration.\n• Previously sedentary people should start with short\ndurations of moderate activities and gradually increase\nduration or intensity.\n• Physical activity should be supplemented with\nstrength-enhancing exercises at least twice a week to\nimprove musculoskeletal health, maintain independence\nin performing the activities of daily life, and reduce\nthe risk of falling.\n• Consult with a physician before beginning a new\nphysical activity program if you have—or are at risk\nfor—a medical condition (such as heart disease, high\nblood pressure, or diabetes), or if you are a man older\nthan 40 years or a woman older than 50.\nBuild a Healthy Base\nLet the Pyramid guide your food choices\nYour body needs more than 40 nutrients and other substances\nfor good health.  No one food can give you all the nutrients your\nbody needs, no matter how much you enjoy it or how nutri-\ntious the food is.  By eating a wide variety of foods each day,\nyou will keep your meals exciting and you will achieve the\nbalance of nutrients that best ensures good health.  (See page\n11 for more information on the Food Guide Pyramid.)\nChoose a variety of grains daily, especially whole grains\nChoosing a diet rich in grains, especially whole grains,\nreduces your risk of many diseases.  These foods provide\ndifferent types of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, as well as\nphytochemicals—important plant substances that may be\nbeneficial to health.  Rely on a wide variety of these foods\nrather than supplements as your source of nutrients, fiber,\nand phytochemicals.  Aim for 6 servings each day—more\nif you are very active—and include several servings of\nwhole-grain foods.  (See Chapter 2, page 33.)\nChoose a variety of fruits and vegetables daily\nFruits and vegetables are essential in your diet.  They provide\nmany vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber, and\nthey are low in calories and provide no fat.  The goal is to\nhave at least 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables\nevery day.  Variety is important.

(See Chapters 4 and 5, pages\n79 through 149, for ideas on how to include these impor-\ntant foods as regular features in your meals.  Part II, page\n150, also describes the bounty from which to choose.)\nKeep foods safe to eat\nFood safety is vital.  It starts well before you purchase food.\nHowever, the steps you control also make a difference.\nThey include making sure you have clean hands and work\nsurfaces—before and during the handling of food.  Take care\nto separate raw, cooked, and ready-to-eat foods at all times.\nKeep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.  Make sure to\ncook food to the proper temperature.  Refrigerate perish-\nable foods and leftovers promptly.  Follow the dates on\ncontainers.  And finally, when in doubt, throw it out.  (For\nfurther discussion on food safety issues, see Chapter 5,\npage 148.)\nChoose Sensibly\nChoose a diet that is low in saturated fat and choles-\nterol and moderate in total fat\nFat is a nutrient that is essential for health, but too much fat\nin your diet, especially saturated fat, increases your risk of\nseveral diseases, including heart disease.  Most important,\nlearn to identify the sources of fats, saturated fats, and cho-\nlesterol, and make healthful food choices.  (See Chapter 2, Fats,\npage 26, and Chapter 3, Coronary Artery Disease, page 61.)\nChoose beverages and foods to moderate your intake \nof sugars\nSome foods that contain natural sugar (such as fruits, vegetables,\nand milk products) also contain essential nutrients.  Others,\nsuch as table sugar, sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages,\ncandy, and some baked goods, supply calories but few other\nnutrients.  When consuming sugar, moderation is key. (See\nChapter 2, Carbohydrates, page 18.)\nChoose and prepare foods with less salt\nSodium, a nutrient, is a major part of table salt (sodium chlo-\nride). It is found naturally in many foods in small amounts.\nSalt and sodium compounds are also added to processed\nfoods, and salt may be used in cooking or added at the table.\nReducing sodium intake lowers high blood pressure in\nsome individuals.  Moderation in sodium intake is recom-\nmended.  (See Chapter 3, High Blood Pressure, page 53.)\nIf you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation\nAlcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and hard liquor) are a\nsource of extra calories.  When consumed in excess, alcohol\ncan impair judgment, result in dependency, and lead to\nseveral serious health problems.  However, evidence suggests\nthat a moderate intake of alcohol is associated with a lower\nrisk of disease of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular\ndisease) in some individuals.  Discuss the consumption of\nalcohol with your health care provider.  (See sidebar:\nAlcohol and Health, page 387.)\n10\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nDIET AND EXERCISE—THE PERFECT PAIR\nDiet along with exercise is the most effective way to lose weight.\nA deficit of 500 calories daily can add up to a loss of 1 pound a week.\nHere are some suggestions for skimming approximately 250 to 300 calories off your daily diet \nand for burning an additional 250 calories through increased physical activity.\nDIET\nDecrease usual meat intake by 3 to 4 ounces daily\nCut butter, margarine, or oil by 2 tablespoons daily\nEliminate two 12-ounce cans of sweetened carbonated\nbeverages daily\nDecrease beer intake by two 12-ounce cans daily\nDo not eat a candy bar\nEXERCISE\nWalk at a moderate pace for 60 minutes daily\nGarden for 50 minutes daily\nSwim laps for 30 minutes daily\nJog 25 minutes daily\nBike briskly for 25 minutes daily\nTHE POWER OF THE FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID\nThe Food Guide Pyramid, the triangular symbol you see on\nmany food packages, was developed by nutrition experts at\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (see below).\nThe Pyramid is an educational tool that translates nutrient\nrequirements into the foods you need to eat and helps you\nput into action the advice offered by the Dietary Guidelines.\nIn graphic form, the Pyramid displays the variety of food\nchoices and the correct proportions needed to attain the rec-\nommended amounts of all the nutrients you need with-\nout consuming an excess of calories.  The Pyramid divides\nall foods into six categories, based on the nutrients they\ncontain.\nChapter 1:  Optimizing Health\n11\nVegetables: Fresh or\ncooked vegetables,\nvegetable sauces,\nor juices\nMeats and other high-protein foods: Lean meats,\npoultry, fish, eggs (3 to 4 yolks per week), cooked\ndry beans, peas, lentils, peanut butter, nuts, \nseeds, tofu\nFats, oils, and sweets (eat sparingly)\nMilk products: Skim or low-fat\nmilk, yogurt, low-fat or nonfat\ncheeses or cottage cheese\nGrains: Whole-grain breads,\nbagels, English muffins,\nbreakfast cereals (whole-\ngrain, cooked, or ready-\nto-eat), crackers,\ntortillas, pancakes,\npasta, rice\nFruits: Fresh fruit (apple, apricots,\nbanana, berries, dates, figs, grapefruit,\ngrapes, guava, kiwi, mango, melon,\nnectarine, orange, pineapple), \ncanned fruit, juices\nThe Food Guide Pyramid was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The pyramid incorporates many principles that\nemphasize a plant-based diet that is low in fat, high in fiber, and rich in important vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. \nAll of these factors contribute to optimal health and help you to control your weight and to reduce the risk of heart disease and\nsome types of cancer.  The arrangement of the food groups in a pyramid shape calls attention to the kinds of foods to eat more \nof and those to eat in moderation.\nTHE FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID\n12\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nSIZING UP YOUR SERVINGS\nEven if you eat a variety of foods, serving sizes are an important part of maintaining a healthful weight.\nKnowing them can help you gauge if you are eating enough food — or too much. \nGRAINS\n1 slice bread\n1 ounce ready-to-eat cereal (large handful or check the package label)\n1/2 cup cooked cereal, rice, or pasta (similar to the size of an ice cream scoop)\nFRUITS\n1 medium apple or orange (size of tennis ball)\n1 medium banana\n1/2 cup cut-up, canned, or cooked fruit\n3/4 cup 100% fruit juice\nVEGETABLES\n1 cup raw leafy vegetables (the size of your fist)\n1/2 cup other vegetables, chopped (raw or cooked)\n3/4 cup vegetable juice\nMILK PRODUCTS\n(choose low-fat varieties)\n1 cup milk or yogurt\n1 1/2 ounces natural cheese (the size of a pair of dice \nor pair of dominoes)\n2 ounces low-fat processed cheese\nMEATS\n2 to 3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish \n(about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand)\nTHE FOLLOWING ALSO EQUAL 1 OUNCE OF MEAT:\n1/2 cup cooked dry beans or legumes (ice cream scoop) \n1 egg (3 to 4 yolks per week)\n2 tablespoons peanut butter\n1/3 cup nuts\n1/2 cup tofu\nFATS, OILS, AND SWEETS\n(These foods add calories and are usually low in nutrients.  Eat them sparingly.)\nONE SERVING EQUALS\nChapter 1:  Optimizing Health\n13\nThe six categories of the Pyramid are:\n• Grain products (bread, cereal, rice, and pasta)\n• Fruits\n• Vegetables\n• Milk products (milk, yogurt, cheese)\n• Meats and other high-protein foods (lean meats,\npoultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts)\n• Fats, oils, and sweets\nThe shape of the Pyramid, widest at the base and narrowest\nat the tip, makes it easy to visualize the contribution that each\ngroup of foods should make to your overall eating plan\nwhen you follow the Dietary Guidelines.  The emphasis of\nthe Pyramid is on increasing the proportion of fruits,\nvegetables, and grains—those foods that form the base of the\nPyramid—and decreasing the proportion of higher-fat\nfoods—the ones at the very top—in our diets. \nThe grain group, which includes bread, cereal, rice,\nand pasta, forms the broad foundation of the Pyramid to\nemphasize that grains should be a major contributor to\nour overall diet.  As often as possible, our choices of grain\nfoods should be those made from whole grains, for the\nmost nutritional value.  \nAs illustrated by the Pyramid, in addition to grains,\nour diet should include ample servings of  fruits and veg-\netables.  If our daily need is to be met for vitamins, minerals,\nfiber, and other important phytochemicals (plant chemi-\ncals that are believed to play a role in preventing disease),\nthe bulk of our diets must come from plant foods.  \nBecause of the saturated fat they contain, meats, poultry,\nand seafood (the high-protein foods) and dairy products\n(high in protein, calcium, and other minerals) should make\na smaller contribution to our daily fare.  Foods that occu-\npy the tip of the Pyramid, pure fats (cooking oil, butter, and\nmargarine) and high-fat, high-sugar sweets, are the ones\nto include only sparingly, like the proverbial icing on the\ncake.  The Pyramid is designed to promote and encourage\nCHILDREN, TEEN GIRLS, \nTEEN BOYS,\nMOST WOMEN, \nACTIVE WOMEN, \nACTIVE MEN,\nOLDER ADULTS\nMOST MEN\nVERY ACTIVE WOMEN\nCalorie level\nAbout 1,600\nAbout 2,200\nAbout 2,800\nSUGGESTED NUMBER OF SERVINGS\nGrain group\n6\n9\n11\nFruit group\n2\n3\n4\nVegetable group\n3\n4\n5\nMilk group\n2–3*\n2–3*\n2–3*\nMeat group\n2 \n2\n3\n(for a total of\n(for a total of\n(for a total of\n5 ounces)\n6 ounces)\n7 ounces)\nTotal fat \n(less than 30% of \ncalories) \n53 grams or less†\n73 grams or less†\n93 grams or less†\n*3 servings are recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, teenagers, and young adults up to age 24.\n†Values are rounded off.\nHOW MANY SERVINGS DO YOU NEED EACH DAY?\nThis table tells you how many servings to aim for from each food group.

This includes the fat you find in foods and the fat that you add to foods.\n14\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\na plant-based diet, one that is  based primarily on grains,\nfruits, and vegetables.  Yet, by including all types of foods,\nthe Pyramid emphasizes the need for us to choose a variety\nof foods and the fact that there are no “bad” foods.  \nThe Pyramid is designed to address the needs of all persons\nolder than 2 years by providing a range of recommended\nservings for each food group (see sidebars: Sizing Up Your\nServings, page 12, and How Many Servings Do You Need\nEach Day? page 13).  The number of servings that you\nshould choose from each food group depends on your\ncalorie needs, which in turn depend on your age, size, sex,\nand activity level.  The lower number of servings provides\na total daily energy intake of about 1,600 calories.  This\ncalorie level meets the needs of most sedentary women and\nsome older adults.  The higher number of servings, which\nprovides approximately 2,800 calories, is recommended\nfor physically active men, teen boys, and some very active\nwomen.  The middle range of servings is designed to provide\nabout 2,200 calories, sufficient for children, teen girls,\nactive women, and most men.  These calorie estimates\nassume that you choose lean meats, lower-fat dairy foods,\nand vegetables and grains prepared and eaten with minimal\nadded fat and sugar.\nIn 1999, the USDA released a Children’s Pyramid.  The\nChildren’s Pyramid was designed to address the needs of 2-\nto 6-year-olds.  It has proportionally smaller portions and\nnumbers of recommended servings from each group of foods\nexcept fruits and vegetables.  This emphasizes that children,\ntoo, need at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\nSimilar to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the\nFood Guide Pyramid undergoes periodic updates to reflect\nwhat we have learned about the role of nutrition in disease\nprevention.  To get an idea of the changes you might see in\nthe next Pyramid, let’s take a look at some other Pyramids\nthat have been constructed.\nOther Pyramids \nThe risk for heart disease and some types of cancer among\npeople who live in the Mediterranean region—southern\nItaly, France, Spain, and Greece—is significantly lower\nthan the risk in Americans.  Nutritional scientists have\nuncovered strong evidence that the eating, drinking, and\nexercise habits of the Mediterranean people play a major role\nin their low risk for disease.  The Mediterranean diet has\nbeen illustrated as a “Mediterranean Pyramid,” based on our\nown Food Guide Pyramid.  It is built on a foundation of\npasta, bread, rice, and other grains, with large contribu-\ntions of vegetables and legumes (beans and peas) and small\nportions of meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products.\nThe fat used in cooking and for dressings is olive oil, rather\nthan butter.  Desserts consist of fresh fruits, and meals are\naccompanied by wine.  This plant-based diet is naturally low\nin saturated fat, higher in monounsaturated fats (from olive\noil), and rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals\n(see Chapter 2, page 33).  In addition to adhering to a plant-\nbased diet (which includes generous servings of legumes\nsuch as kidney beans, peas, and lentils), Mediterranean\npeople have a more physically active lifestyle than most\nAmericans.  This factor also may contribute to their lower\nrisk of heart disease.  The major difference between the\nMediterranean diet and the USDA Food Guide Pyramid\nlies in the distinction between the recommendation to\nlower total fat, which places all high-fat foods at the tip of\nthe Pyramid, and the Mediterranean practice of including\nmonounsaturated fats but limiting saturated fats (see\nChapter 2, page 26).\nYou also may have heard of other Pyramids, such as a\nVegetarian Pyramid and an Asian Pyramid.  Like the\nMediterranean Pyramid, these pyramids were constructed to\nillustrate dietary practices of groups whose risk of heart disease\nand some types of cancer is lower than that of people who\nconsume a typical Western diet.  Not surprisingly, these\npyramids also illustrate diets that are plant-based and low in\nsaturated fat.  Still other pyramids are designed merely to\nshowcase foods that are native to particular regions or pro-\nduced by particular companies.  The Mayo Clinic Healthy\nWeight Pyramid and the California Pyramid, however, have\none unique feature that we may see incorporated into a future\nFood Guide Pyramid, that is, the inclusion of fruits and veg-\netables, rather than grains, as the foundation of the Pyramid.\nBy replacing grains with fruits and vegetables at the base, the\ncritical need to increase our intake of these foods is emphasized.\nOTHER VOICES:  GUIDELINES OF HEALTH\nORGANIZATIONS\nIn addition to the Food Guide Pyramid and the Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans, several private health organiza-\ntions (the American Heart Association, the American\nCancer Society, and the American Institute for Cancer\nResearch) have issued their own nutritional guidelines.  \nWhen the guidelines of all the major health organizations\nare compared, they are similar.  Recognizing this, experts\nfrom the American Heart Association, the American Cancer\nChapter 1:  Optimizing Health\n15\nSociety, the American Dietetic Association, the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Society for Clinical\nNutrition, and the National Institutes of Health met in\n1999 to review scientific evidence and to identify practices\nthat are effective against major diseases.  The dietary rec-\nommendations that these groups have in common include:\n• Total fat:  no more than 30% of calories\n• Saturated fat:  less than 10% of calories\n• Monounsaturated fat:  no more than 15% of calories\n• Polyunsaturated fat:  no more than 15% of calories\n• Cholesterol:  no more than 300 milligrams daily\n• Carbohydrates:  55% or more of calories\n• Salt (sodium chloride): less than 6 grams daily (4 grams\nof sodium)\nThese recommendations can be achieved by following the\nDietary Guidelines for Americans (page 9) and by using the\nFood Guide Pyramid (page 11).\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  OPTIMIZING HEALTH\nThe message is clear.  Nutrition experts agree that when you\nlower the total fat, saturated fat, and added sugar in your\ndiet and increase the vitamins, minerals, and fiber by eating\nmore fruits, vegetables, and grains, you can improve your\nquality of life and help prevent many of the diseases that are\nthe leading causes of death.  Now that you know the goals\nand guidelines for healthful eating, we will provide you\nwith the nutrition and food selection knowledge you need\nto put those guidelines into practice.\nChapter 2 explains the nutrients we all need, the roles\nthey play in promoting health, the best food sources for\nthese nutrients, and how your nutritional needs change\nthroughout your life.  Chapter 3 describes how your risk for\nserious illnesses is influenced by your diet.  Chapters 4 and\n5 help you learn to use the Food Guide Pyramid to choose\nthe most nutritious foods, and they give you guidance\nabout planning and preparing healthful, appetizing meals.\nRed Meat\nSweets\n Eggs\nPoultry\nFish\nCheese and Yogurt\nOlive Oil (variable amounts)\nFruits\nBeans,\nLegumes\nand Nuts\nVegetables\nBreads, Pasta, Rice, Couscous,\nPolenta, Bulgar, Other Grains\nand Potatoes\nA few times per month\nA few times per week\nDaily\nWine in\nmoderation\nEggs and Poultry     \nFruits\nLegumes,\nNuts &\nSeeds\nVegetables\nRice, Rice Products, Noodles, Breads,\nMillet, Corn & Other Grains\nor Dairy\nVegetable Oils\nFish &\nShellfish\nRed Meat\nSweets\nMonthly\nWeekly\nOptional Daily\nDaily\nMediterranean\nPyramid\nMayo Clinic \nHealthy Weight Pyramid\nPhysical Activity\nPhysical Activity\nCalifornia Pyramid\nAsian Pyramid\nIn this chapter, you will be introduced to the \nnutrients your body needs.

In this chapter, we\nfocus on the nutrients themselves—how they are digested,\nwhat happens to them in the body, and what they do for you.\nWe also say a little about the best food sources of each nutri-\nent, because, after all, when you go to the supermarket,\nyou don’t look for protein, starch, fiber, and antioxidants,\nyou look for chicken, rice, raisin bran, and orange juice.\nNutrients are sorted into categories on the basis of their\nchemical structures and functions.  Carbohydrates, proteins,\nand fats contained in foods are known as the macronutrients,\nbecause they are required in the largest quantities.  In\naddition to their other functions, macronutrients provide\nenergy in the form of calories.  Vitamins and minerals are\nknown as the micronutrients.  They are\nrequired by your body in much smaller\nquantities.  Although the micronutri-\nents help your body use the energy in\nmacronutrients, they provide no energy\n(calories) themselves.  Water is also an\nessential, calorie- free nutrient. The work\nour bodies do each day causes us to deplete\nsome of our stores of these essential nutrients.\nOnly by maintaining a diet that is rich in\nvarious nutrient-containing foods can we replace\nthose lost nutrients.\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nr\n \nt\nw\no\nNUTRIENTS\nAND OTHER FOOD\nSUBSTANCES\nTHE\nT\nhere is no one perfect food.  We need an assortment\nof nutrients that can be obtained only by eating a\nwide variety of foods.  What is it that our bodies need?\nScientists have identified more than 40 different nutrients\nin food.  These substances are essential for growth and for\nthe chemical reactions and processes that keep us alive and\nfunctioning (metabolism).\nExcept for an extremely small number of foods that\nconsist almost entirely of one nutrient, the vast majority of\nthe foods we eat are mixtures of many nutrients.  Nevertheless,\neach group of foods included in the Food Guide Pyramid\n(grains, fruits and vegetables, milk products, and meats)\n(see Chapter 1, page 11) is unique in the types of nutrients\nit contributes to our diets.  For example,\nfruits and vegetables are the main\nsource of many vitamins, minerals,\nand complex carbohydrates in our\ndiets, and the meat group (includ-\ning dry beans and legumes, eggs,\npoultry, and fish) is the main source\nof protein for most people.  \nIt can be difficult to understand\nthe difference between the nutrients\nthemselves and the foods that con-\ntain them.  For example, when you\nhear nutrition experts talk about the need\nIn addition to the known nutrients, substances in foods\nof plant origin, called phytochemicals or phytonutrients\n(phyto is the Greek word for plant), have been identified in\nrecent studies.  These phytochemicals may promote health\nand help prevent certain diseases.  Hundreds of such\ncompounds are being identified in the fruits, vegetables,\nnuts, beans, and grains we eat, although only a few have\nbeen thoroughly studied.  How these various phytochem-\nicals influence our health is a promising new area of research\nfor nutrition experts.\nTHE MACRONUTRIENTS:\nCARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, AND FATS\nEach of the macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and\nfats—plays various roles in the function of our bodies.  In\naddition to their unique functions, all of the macronutrients\nsupply calories.  When we eat more protein, carbohydrate,\nor fat than we need to replenish what we have used, the\nexcess is converted to and stored as fat.  Calories are used\nto support all muscular activity, to carry out the metabol-\nic reactions that sustain the body, to maintain body\ntemperature, and to support growth.  But when we con-\nsistently take in more calories than we use, we gain weight.\nWeight is maintained when energy (calorie) intake balances\nenergy output (see Chapter 3, page 48).\nCARBOHYDRATES\nThe carbohydrates are a vast and diverse group of nutrients\nfound in most foods.  This group includes simple sugars\n(like the sugar you add to your morning coffee) and complex\nforms such as starches (contained in pasta, bread, cereal,\nand in some fruits and vegetables), which are broken down\nduring digestion to produce simple sugars.  The main\nfunction of the simple sugars and starches in the foods we\neat is to deliver calories for energy.  The simple sugar glucose\nis required to satisfy the energy needs of the brain, whereas\nour muscles use glucose for short-term bouts of activity.\nThe liver and muscles also convert small amounts of the\nsugar and starch that we eat into a storage form called\nglycogen.  After a long workout, muscle glycogen stores\nmust be replenished.  Both simple sugars and starches\nprovide about 4 calories per gram (a gram is about the\nweight of a paper clip). Because carbohydrates serve\nprimarily as sources of calories (and we can get calories\nfrom other macronutrients), no specific requirement has\nbeen set for them (see Chapter 1, The Dietary Reference\nIntakes [DRIs], page 5).  But health experts agree that we\nshould obtain most of our calories (about 60 percent) from\ncarbohydrates.  Our individual requirements depend on\nage, sex, size, and activity level.  \nIn contrast to the other carbohydrates, fiber (a substance\ncontained in bran, fruits, vegetables, and legumes) is a type\nof complex carbohydrate that cannot be readily digested by\nour bodies.  Even though it isn’t digested, fiber is essential\nto our health. Nutrition professionals recommend 25 to 30\ngrams of fiber daily.\nSimple Sugars\nSimple sugars make foods sweet.  They are small molecules\nfound in many foods and in many forms.  Some simple\nsugars occur naturally in foods.  For example, fructose is the\nsugar that naturally gives some fruits their sweet flavor.  \nTable sugar, the sugar that we spoon onto our cereal\nand add to the cookies we bake, also called sucrose, is the\nmost familiar simple sugar.  A ring-shaped molecule of\nsucrose actually consists of a molecule of fructose chemi-\ncally linked to a molecule of another simple sugar called\nglucose.  Sugars such as fructose and glucose are known as\nmonosaccharides, because of their single (mono) ring\nstructure, whereas two-ringed sugars such as sucrose are\nknown as disaccharides.  Another disaccharide, lactose, the\nsugar that gives milk its slightly sweet taste, consists of\nglucose linked to yet another simple sugar called galactose.\nThe inability to digest lactose to its constituent sugars is the\ncause of lactose intolerance, a condition common to adults\nof Asian, Mediterranean, and African ancestry.\nThe table sugar that we purchase is processed from\nsugar cane or sugar beets.  As an additive to many different\ntypes of prepared or processed foods, sucrose adds nutritive\nvalue (in the form of calories only), flavor, texture, and\nstructure, while helping to retain moisture.  Today, sucrose\nis most often used to sweeten (nondietetic) carbonated\nbeverages and fruit drinks (other than juice), candy, pastries,\ncakes, cookies, and frozen desserts.  One of the most com-\nmonly consumed forms of sugar is called high-fructose corn\nsyrup.  High-fructose corn syrup is also commonly used to\nsweeten sodas, fruit drinks (not juices), some ice creams, and\nsome manufactured pastries and cookies.  Other forms of\nsucrose include brown sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and\nturbinado (raw) sugar.\n18\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nFoods that are high in added sugar are often low in essen-\ntial nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately,\nthese foods are often eaten in place of more nutrient-rich\nfoods such as fruits, vegetables, and low-fat whole-grain\nproducts, and they may prevent us from obtaining essen-\ntial nutrients and lead to weight gain.\nNutritionists are concerned by the enormous increase\nin sugar consumption by Americans during the past 30\nyears, particularly because much of this sugar is in the form\nof soft drinks.  On average, teens today drink twice as much\nsoda as milk, and young adults drink three times as much\nsoda as milk.  As a result, their intake of calcium-rich foods\nis low, a factor that is thought to contribute to lower bone\nmass.  This can lead to an increased risk of  bone problems\nas we grow older (see Chapter 3, Osteoporosis, page 67).\nThe increase in sugar consumption also has been attrib-\nuted to the increasing availability of low-fat versions of\nsuch dessert and snack foods as cookies, cakes, and frozen\ndesserts.  Often, the sugar content of these foods is high\nbecause sugar is used to replace the flavor lost when the\nfat is decreased.  Sugar promotes tooth decay, when\nconsumed in forms that allow it to remain in contact with\nthe teeth for extended periods (see sidebar: “Hidden” Sugar\nin Common Foods, this page).\nThus, foods that are high in sugar, or sugar and fat,\nand have few other nutrients to offer appear at the top of\nthe Food Guide Pyramid because they should be eaten\nsparingly.  In contrast, choosing fresh fruits, which are\nnaturally sweetened with their own fructose, or low-fat\nyogurt, which contains lactose (natural milk sugar), allows\nus to get the vitamins and minerals contained in those\nfoods as well as other food components that contribute to\nhealth but may not have yet been identified.\nOn the positive side, there is no credible evidence to\ndemonstrate that sugar causes diabetes, attention deficit-\nhyperactivity disorder, depression, or hypoglycemia.  No\nevidence has been found that sugar-containing foods are\n“addictive” in the true sense of the word, although many\npeople report craving sweet foods, particularly those that\nare also high in fat.\nComplex Carbohydrates\nFound almost exclusively in foods of plant origin, complex\ncarbohydrates are long chains of molecules of the simple\nsugar glucose.  The complex carbohydrates in plant foods\ncan be divided into two groups: starch and fiber.  \nStarch is the form of carbohydrate that is found in grains,\nsome fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds. It\nprovides energy for newly sprouting plants.  Fiber is the\ntougher material that forms the coat of a seed and other\nstructural components of the plant (see illustration on page\n20).  Starches are digested by our bodies into their constituent\nglucose molecules and used for energy, whereas fiber is not.\nStarch, like simple sugars, provides 4 calories per gram,\nwhereas fiber (sometimes called nonnutritive fiber) provides\nno calories.  Like simple sugars, the role of starches in our\ndiets is mainly to provide energy.  \nFiber is actually a family of substances found in fruits,\nvegetables, legumes, and the outer layers of grains.  Scientists\ndivide fiber into two categories:  those that do not dissolve\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n19\n“HIDDEN” SUGAR IN COMMON FOODS\nSome foods contain sugar that has been added during\nprocessing.  The following foods contain a large amount \nof sugar.  The sugar content is shown in grams, and its\nequivalents in teaspoons are also given.\nTry to eat high-sugar foods less frequently or in smaller\namounts. Check labels and compare similar foods—choose\nthose that are lower in sugar content.

Soluble fibers include pectin, found\nin fruits, and gums, found in some grains and legumes (see\nsidebar:  Plant Fibers:  Insoluble and Soluble, below).\nFiber-rich diets, which  include ample amounts of\nwhole-grain foods, legumes, and fresh vegetables and fruits,\nhave been linked with a lower risk of several diseases.\nNutrition scientists are just beginning to understand the role\nof dietary fiber in maintaining health.  Fiber appears to\nsweep the digestive system free of unwanted substances\nthat could promote cancer and to maintain regularity and\nprevent disorders of the digestive tract.  Fiber also provides\na sense of fullness that may help reduce overeating and\nunwanted weight gain.  Diets that are rich in fiber and\ncomplex carbohydrates have been associated with lower\nserum cholesterol and a lower risk for high blood pressure,\ncoronary artery disease, and some types of cancer.  But does\nthis mean that it’s okay just to take a fiber pill? No! Rather,\nthe studies that have shown the beneficial effects of a high-\nfiber diet (containing 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day) have\nbeen those in which the dietary fiber is in the form of fruits,\nvegetables, whole grains, and cereals.  These and other\nstudies suggest that not only the fiber in these foods but also\n20\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nInsoluble Fiber—also known as roughage\nThese fibers hold onto water, add bulk, and promote movement through the intestine.\nCELLULOSE\nHEMICELLULOSE\nLIGNIN\nWhole-wheat flour \nBran\nWoody portions of plants:  \nBran\nWhole grains\nsuch as stem of broccoli, carrots\nNuts\nVegetables\nWheat\nVegetables\nFruits\nFruits with edible seeds, such as raspberries\nand strawberries\nSoluble Fiber—dissolves in water and becomes gummy\nThese types of fibers can help lower blood cholesterol and blood glucose.\nGUMS\nPECTIN\nOats\nApples\nLegumes and dried beans\nCitrus fruits: oranges, grapefruits\nBarley\nCarrots\nThe wheat kernel (or seed) consists of the fiber-rich outer bran\nlayer; the inner endosperm, which is composed of starch, proteins,\nand B vitamins and is made into flour; and the germ, which is\nground and sold as wheat germ, a rich source of vitamin E.\nPLANT FIBERS:  INSOLUBLE AND SOLUBLE\nwheat berry\nbrush\nendosperm\ngerm\nbran\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n21\nthe vitamins, minerals, and other compounds they contain\ncontribute to their health-promoting effects.  \nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see Chapter 1,\npage 8) recommend that we obtain most (about 60%) of\nour calories from carbohydrates, preferably complex\ncarbohydrates, in the form of foods such as whole grains,\nfruits, vegetables, and legumes.  These  foods are good\nsources of fiber, essential vitamins, minerals, and other\nphytochemicals and are also more likely to be low in fat.\nThe average American today consumes only about a\nthird of the recommended amount of fiber.  To obtain as\nmany of the potential benefits as possible, you need to\nobtain complex carbohydrates and fiber from various food\nsources.  Although studies indicate that our intake of\ncarbohydrates is increasing, the contribution of whole-grain\nfoods remains small, partly because identifying whole-grain\nfoods can be confusing.  For ideas on what whole-grain\nfoods to look for in your supermarket, see the sidebars\nWhere Are the Whole Grains? and Finding Fiber, this page.  \nFoods that are naturally good sources of fiber or have\nfiber added are allowed to make claims on their labels\nregarding their fiber content.  What do the terms used to\ndescribe fiber content mean?  When you see the phrase\n“high fiber” on a food label, it means that 1 serving (defined\non the Nutrition Facts panel) of the food contains 5 grams of\nfiber or more per serving.  A food that contains 2.5 to 4.9\ngrams of fiber in a serving is allowed to call itself a “good\nsource” of fiber, and a food label that says “more fiber” or\n“added fiber” has at least 2.5 grams more fiber per serving.  \nSugar Substitutes\nFor the same reason that people have recently sought sub-\nstitutes for fat, noncaloric sugar substitutes became popular\nin the 1960s as people began to try to control their weight.\nSugar substitutes are of two basic types:  intense sweeteners\nand sugar alcohols.\nFOOD\nSERVING\nFIBER\n(GRAMS)\nApple with skin\n1 medium \n4\nBanana\n1 medium \n3\nOrange juice\n3/4 cup\nLess than 1\nOrange \n1 medium \n3\nStrawberries\n1 cup halves\n4\nBroccoli, raw\n1/2 cup\n1\nBroccoli, cooked\n1/2 cup\n2\nCarrot, raw\n1 medium \n2\nPotato, baked with skin\n1 medium \n4\nSpinach, cooked\n1/2 cup\n2\nSpinach, raw\n1 cup\n1\nTomato\n1 medium \n1\nLentils, cooked\n1/2 cup\n8\nBeans, baked\n1/2 cup\n7\nWhite bread\n1 slice \nLess than 1\nWhole-wheat bread\n1 slice\n2\nPumpernickel bread\n1 slice\n2\nRice, white\n1/2 cup\nLess than 1\nRice, brown\n1/2 cup\n2\nBran cereal, 100%\n1/3 cup\n8\nCorn flakes\n1 cup\n1\nOatmeal, cooked\nfrom 1/3 cup dry\n3\nPopcorn, air popped\n1 cup \n1\nSpaghetti, cooked, \n1/2 cup\n1\nregular\nSpaghetti, cooked,\n1/2 cup\n3\nwhole wheat\nHummus \n2 tablespoons\n2 \n(chickpea dip)\nFINDING FIBER\nHow much fiber will you find in the foods you eat?\nWhole-grain bread products are labeled as whole grain,\nwhole wheat, or rye.  \nIn contrast, bread products labeled as made with\nwheat, cracked wheat, seven-grain, multi-grain, stone-\nground wheat, or any of several other names contain\nmostly refined flour and lack the health-promoting \neffects of a whole-grain product.\nWHERE ARE THE WHOLE GRAINS?\nIntense sweeteners are also called non-nutritive sweet-\neners, because they are so much sweeter than sugar that\nthe small amounts needed to sweeten foods contribute\nvirtually no calories to the foods.  These sweeteners also do\nnot promote tooth decay.  Currently,  four such intense\nsweeteners are available, both for use in processed foods and\nfor home consumption.  The U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) has set “acceptable daily intakes”\n(ADI) for these sweeteners.  The ADI is the amount that\ncan be consumed daily over a lifetime without risk.\nOne of these sweeteners is aspartame (NutraSweet brand).\nIt is manufactured by chemically modifying the naturally\noccurring amino acid phenylalanine.  This sweetener can’t\nbe used by people with phenylketonuria (a rare congenital\ndisorder that disrupts the body’s ability to metabolize phenyl-\nalanine and can result in severe nerve damage).  Despite\nextensive safety testing showing aspartame to be safe, its\nuse has been implicated by the popular press in everything\nfrom headaches to loss of attentiveness.  At this time, there\nis no scientific validity to these claims.  Aspartame is not heat\nstable, so it can’t be added to foods that will be cooked or\nbaked, although it can be added to some foods (such as\ncoffee) after heating.\nSaccharin, a second non-nutritive sweetener, was asso-\nciated with cancer in mice when it was fed in very large\namounts.  However, further studies have found no links\nbetween saccharin and human cancer.  This recently led\nthe U.S. government to remove it from its list of potential\ncancer-causing chemicals.  Although saccharin is heat stable,\nin some cases it cannot satisfactorily be used in baking\nbecause it lacks the bulk of sugar.\nAcesulfame K (Sunnett), a third intense sweetener, was\napproved by the FDA in 1998 for use in soft drinks,\nalthough it was used in various food products before that.\nAbout 200 times sweeter than sugar, this noncaloric prod-\nuct has been extensively tested for safety.  After reviewing\nmore than 90 studies, the FDA deemed the sweetener safe\nin amounts up to the equivalent of a 132-pound person\nconsuming 143 pounds of sugar annually (an Acceptable\nDaily Intake of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight;\n1 kilogram is about 2.2 pounds).  Because it is not metab-\nolized, acesulfame K can be used safely by people with diabetes.\nThe sweetener is more heat stable than aspartame, main-\ntaining its structure and flavor at oven temperatures more\nthan 390° Fahrenheit and under a wide range of storage\nconditions.  Like saccharin and aspartame, acesulfame K\nlacks bulk, so its use in home baking requires recipe mod-\nification.  The flavor of acesulfame K has been described as\n22\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nFoods contain a variety of carbohy-\ndrates, from simple to complex.  Fruits,\nvegetables, grains, and dairy products\nall contain carbohydrate.\nclean and quickly perceptible, although disagreement exists\nabout whether it leaves an aftertaste.  \nA fourth intense sweetener, sucralose (Splenda), was\napproved by the FDA in 1998 for sale and use in com-\nmercial food products.  Sucralose is made by chemically\nmodifying sucrose (table sugar) to a non-nutritive, non-\ncaloric powder that is about 600 times sweeter than sugar.\nBefore approving sucralose, the FDA reviewed more than\n110 research studies conducted in both human and animal\nsubjects.  It concluded that the sweetener is safe for\nconsumption by adults, children, and pregnant and breast-\nfeeding women in amounts equivalent to the consump-\ntion of about 48 pounds of sugar annually (an Acceptable\nDaily Intake of 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight).\nPeople with diabetes may also safely consume the sweetener,\nbecause it is not metabolized like sugar.  In addition,\nsucralose is highly stable to heat and so will not lose its\nsweetness when used in recipes that require prolonged\nexposure to high temperatures (such as baking) or when\nstored for long periods.  The product is currently available\nin the form of a powdered sugar substitute and in some\ncommercial baked goods, jams and jellies, sweet sauces and\nsyrups, pastry fillings, condiments, processed fruits, fruit\njuice drinks, and beverages, and its use is approved for\nvarious additional products.  However, use of sucralose in\nhome baking is expected to be limited by its low bulk in\ncomparison with table sugar.\nFoods containing intense sweeteners should not be given\nto infants or children, who need energy to grow and to\nsustain their high activity levels.  Foods that contain intense\nsweeteners and lack any nutritive value also should not\nreplace nutrient-dense foods in your diet.\nThe sugar alcohols xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol\ncontain less than 4 calories per gram.  These sugar alcohols\nare digested so slowly that most are simply eliminated.\nUnfortunately, excessive consumption can cause diarrhea\nor bloating in some people.\nSo-called “natural” sweeteners provide the same number\nof calories as sugar and have acquired the reputation, albeit\nincorrectly, of being healthier than sugar, because they seem\nmore natural than processed table sugar.  These include\nhoney, maple syrup and sugar, date sugar, molasses, and\ngrape juice concentrate.  In reality, these sweeteners contain\nno more vitamins or minerals than table sugar.  Honey\nmay harbor small amounts of the spores of the bacteria\nthat produce botulism toxin and should never be given to\nbabies younger than 1 year.  \nThe Bottom Line on Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates—sugars and starches—are the main source\nof fuel for our bodies.  When we choose carbohydrate-rich\nfoods, our best bets are fruits, vegetables, whole grains,\nand legumes, because these foods are also rich sources of\nhealth-promoting vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and\nfiber.  But like all calories, extra calories from carbohy-\ndrates beyond those we need to replenish the energy we burn\nare converted to fat and stored in our fat cells.  Non-caloric\nsweeteners seem to be a safe alternative to sugar for most\npeople, but the foods that contain them are often nutri-\ntionally empty and their use in home cooking is limited. The\nso-called natural sweeteners are no better for you than sugar.\nPROTEIN\nProtein is an essential part of our diets.  Proteins are large,\ncomplex molecules resembling tangled strings of beads.\nEach of the “beads” on the string is one of a group of smaller\nmolecules called amino acids.  Amino acids are composed\nof carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and some\ncontain sulfur.  \nUsing the amino acids from the protein you eat, the\nbody makes more than 50,000 different proteins.  These\nproteins are the main structural elements of our skin, hair,\nnails, cell membranes, muscles, and connective tissue.\nCollagen, the main protein in our skin, provides a barrier\nto the invasion of foreign substances.  Proteins in cell mem-\nbranes determine what substances can enter and exit cells.\nOur muscles, which contain some 65 percent of the body’s\ntotal protein, give our bodies their shape and strength.\nProteins in connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments,\nand cartilage enable our skeletons to function, form inter-\nnal organs, and hold the organs in place.  Proteins in the\nblood carry oxygen to all cells and remove carbon dioxide\nand other waste products. The proteins in muscle,\nconnective tissue, and blood make up most of the protein\nin the body.  Other proteins called enzymes accelerate meta-\nbolic processes, and still other proteins and amino acids\nare hormones and neurochemicals, the substances that\ndeliver signals throughout the body and regulate all meta-\nbolic processes.  \nDuring periods of growth, our bodies  must manufac-\nture and store large amounts of protein.  Therefore, the\nrequirement for protein in our diets is higher during growth.\nBut even when we are not growing, each of the unique\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n23\nproteins in the body has a finite lifespan and must be replaced\ncontinuously.  So the need for protein never ends.\nDietary Protein and Body Protein\nThe thousands of proteins that make up our bodies are\nassembled on demand from some 20 different amino acids.\nWhat are these amino acids, and where do they come from?\nThe protein from the meat we ate last night is not directly\nincorporated into our muscles.  The proteins in the foods\nwe eat are digested first into small “peptides.”  Some of\nthese peptides are further digested into their constituent\namino acids.  Only amino acids and small peptides are\nactually absorbed by the small intestine into the blood-\nstream.  They are then delivered to the liver, muscles, brain,\nand other organs, where they are used to make new proteins\nor converted to other amino acids needed by those organs.\nOf the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, 9 are\nconsidered “essential” because they cannot be made in our\nbodies and must be obtained from the foods we eat.  Of the\nremaining 11, some are essential for infants and persons with\ncertain diseases (see sidebar: Amino Acid Classification, page\n25).  The rest of the amino acids are considered “nonessential,”\nbecause our bodies can make them in adequate amounts,\nif necessary.  Nevertheless, they are easily supplied by eat-\ning a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of foods.\nMost foods contain protein.  Some foods are better\nsources of protein than others.  “Complete” proteins are\nthose that contain all the essential amino acids in amounts\nneeded to synthesize our body’s proteins.  The best sources\nof complete protein are lean meats and poultry, fish, low-fat\ndairy products, and eggs (see Part II, High-Protein Foods,\npage 291, and Dairy Foods, page 345).\n24\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nLean meats (including poultry and fish)\nand dairy products aren’t the only foods \nthat contain protein.  By eating a variety \nof foods, including grains and legumes, \nyou are likely to meet your needs.\nThe grains and cereals group of foods, which form the\nbase of the Food Guide Pyramid, are excellent sources of\nprotein, but because these proteins often lack one or more\nessential amino acids, they are called “incomplete” proteins.\nFor example, the proteins in corn are low in the essential\namino acids lysine and tryptophan, and wheat is low in\nlysine.  In contrast, legumes tend to be rich in lysine but a\nbit low in methionine.  Among the legumes, soybeans\ncontain the most complete protein.\nDoes this mean you must eat meat, eggs, and dairy\nproducts (foods of animal origin) to get all the amino acids\nyou need?  Not at all.  By eating a variety of different foods,\nincluding grains and legumes, you are likely to get all the\namino acids you need and in the correct amounts.  People\nof many cultures and vegans (vegetarians who eat no foods\nof animal origin) get adequate amounts and types of protein\nby eating various combinations of plant proteins including\nbeans, corn, rice, and  other cereal grains.  Although it was\nonce thought necessary to combine these foods at the same\nmeal, nutrition experts now agree that they can be eaten at\nvarious times throughout the day.\nWhen we eat grains and legumes, rather than foods of\nanimal origin (a more frequent source of protein in our\ndiets), we gain additional health benefits.  Whole-grain\nfoods and legumes are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber,\nand other substances that optimize health.  If that does\nnot seem like reason enough to make the trade, grains and\nlegumes lack the high levels of saturated fat present in foods\nof animal origin, which, as you will learn below, are linked\nto many diseases.\nContrary to popular belief, simply eating more dietary\nprotein, in excess of recommended amounts, will not result\nin bigger muscles.  Our bodies do not store excess protein.\nIf we eat more protein than our bodies need to replenish the\namino acids we have used during the day, the excess amino\nacids are converted to, and stored as, fat.  Dietary protein,\nlike carbohydrates, supplies about 4 calories of energy per\ngram.  Because our requirements for protein mainly depend\non our body’s size, our need for protein increases during\ntimes of rapid growth.  Therefore, the recommendations for\nprotein are age-dependent and are slightly higher for preg-\nnant and breastfeeding women than for other adults (see the\nAppendix:  Dietary Reference Intakes, page 421).  The rec-\nommended allowances ensure an adequate protein intake\nby nearly all healthy people.\nNevertheless, many\nAmericans typically consume twice this amount, often\nin the form of meat and dairy products that are high in\nsaturated fat, which increases the risk for coronary artery\ndisease and some forms of cancer.\nWhat if we eat too little protein?  Few Americans are at\nrisk of eating too little protein.  However, individuals on\nseverely restricted diets, those who are unable to eat, and\nthose whose needs are increased because of illness or trauma\nmay experience protein deficiency.  To replenish the pools\nof essential amino acids that have been depleted, in order to\nmake critical proteins such as enzymes and hormones, the\nbody of a protein-deficient person begins to rob protein\nfrom muscle by digesting that protein to its constituent\namino acids.  Because muscle is needed for various vital\nfunctions (for example, diaphragm muscles for breathing\nand heart muscles for pumping our blood), the loss of large\namounts of muscle protein can be fatal.  Fortunately, the\nvast majority of people, even those who engage in regular,\nrigorous endurance exercise, can easily meet their need for\nprotein by eating a balanced diet based on the Food Guide\nPyramid.\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n25\nAMINO ACID CLASSIFICATION\nOf the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, \nonly 9 are considered “essential” in our diets \nbecause they cannot be made by our bodies and \nmust be obtained from the foods we eat.\nESSENTIAL IN\nESSENTIAL IN OUR\nNONESSENTIAL\nOUR DIETS\nDIETS UNDER SOME\nIN OUR DIETS\nCIRCUMSTANCES\nHistadine\nArginine\nAlanine\nIsoleucine\nCysteine*\nAsparagine\nLeucine\nTyrosine†\nAspartic acid\nLysine\nGlutamic acid\nMethionine\nGlutamine\nPhenylalanine\nGlycine\nThreonine\nProline\nTryptophan\nSerine\nValine\n*Cysteine can be synthesized from the essential amino acid\nmethionine.\n†Tyrosine can be synthesized from phenylalanine when supplied\nin adequate amounts.\nThe Bottom Line on Protein\nAdequate protein is critical for growth, metabolism, and\nhealth, but eating more protein than we need will not build\nbigger muscles.  Conversely, excess protein is converted to\nfat.  Foods of animal origin are high in protein but may also\nbe high in total and saturated fat.  Lean meats and dairy\nproducts, fish, legumes, and grains are the best sources of\nprotein.\nFATS\nIt’s difficult to read a newspaper or listen to the evening\nnews without hearing something new about fat and its\nconnection with disease.  Diets that are high in fat are\nstrongly associated with an increased prevalence of obesity and\nan increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, high\nblood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and certain types of cancer.\nHealth authorities recommend that we reduce our total\nfat intake to about 30 percent of total calories.  They also\nrecommend that we limit our intake of saturated fat (the\ntype of fat most often found in meat and dairy products)\nto less than 10 percent of our fat calories and try to be sure\nthat the fat we do eat is mostly the monounsaturated or\npolyunsaturated type.  These changes have been shown to\ndecrease our risk for several diseases.\nFat as a Nutrient\nFat is an essential nutrient, because our bodies require small\namounts of several fatty acids from foods (the so-called\nessential fatty acids) to build cell membranes and to make\nseveral indispensable hormones, namely, the steroid\nhormones testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen, and the\nhormone-like prostaglandins.  Dietary fats also permit one\ngroup of vitamins, the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and\nK), to be absorbed from foods during the process of\ndigestion.  Fats help these vitamins to be transported\nthrough the blood to their destinations.  The fat in our\nbodies also provides protective insulation and shock absorp-\ntion for vital organs.\nAs a macronutrient, fat is a source of energy (calories).\nThe fat in food supplies about 9 calories per gram, more\nthan twice the number of calories as the same amount of\nprotein or carbohydrate.  As a result, high-fat foods are\nconsidered “calorie-dense” energy sources.  Any dietary fat\nthat is not used by the body for energy is stored in fat cells\n(adipocytes), the constituents of fat (adipose) tissue (see\nChapter 3, Obesity, page 47).  The Dietary Guidelines for\nAmericans recommend that no more than 30 percent of our\ncalories should come from fat, and only a third of that\nshould be saturated fat.\nSorting Out the Fats\nOur health is influenced by both the amount and the type\nof fat that we eat.  Fats are molecules; they are classified\naccording to the chemical structures of their component\nparts.  But you don’t need to be a chemist to understand the\nconnection between the various fats in foods and the effect\nthese fats have on the risk for disease.  Some definitions will help.\nDietary fats, or triglycerides, are the fats in foods.  They\nare molecules made of fatty acids (chain-like molecules of\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) linked in groups of three to\na backbone called glycerol.  When we eat foods that contain\nfat, the fatty acids are separated from their glycerol backbone\nduring the process of digestion.\nFatty acids are either saturated or unsaturated, terms\nthat refer to the relative number of hydrogen atoms attached\nto a carbon chain.  Fat in the foods that we eat is made up\nof mixtures of fatty acids—some fats may be mostly unsat-\nurated, whereas others are mostly saturated (see sidebar:\nA Comparison of Fats, page 27).\nMonounsaturated fatty acids are fatty acids that lack\none pair of hydrogen atoms on their carbon chain.  Foods\nrich in monounsaturated fatty acids include canola, nut,\nand olive oils; they are liquid at room temperature.  A diet\nthat provides the primary source of fat as monounsatu-\nrated fat (frequently in the form of olive oil) and includes\nonly small amounts of animal products has been linked to\na lower risk of coronary artery disease.  This type of diet\nis commonly eaten by people who live in the region sur-\nrounding the Mediterranean Sea (see Chapter 1, page 14).  \nPolyunsaturated fatty acids lack two or more pairs of\nhydrogen atoms on their carbon chain.  Safflower, sun-\nflower, sesame, corn, and soybean oil are among the sources\nof polyunsaturated fats (which are also liquid at room\ntemperature).  The essential fatty acids, linoleic and\nlinolenic acid, are polyunsaturated fats.  Like monoun-\nsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats lower blood choles-\nterol levels and are an acceptable substitute for saturated\nfats in the diet.\nSaturated fatty acids, or saturated fats, consist of fatty\nacids that are “saturated” with hydrogen.  These fats are\nfound primarily in foods of animal origin—meat, poultry,\ndairy products, and eggs—and in coconut, palm, and\n26\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\npalm kernel oil (often called “tropical oils”).  Foods that are\nhigh in saturated fats are firm at room temperature.\nBecause a high intake of saturated fats increases your risk\nof coronary artery disease, nutrition experts recommend that\nless than 10 percent of your calories should come from sat-\nurated fats.  To find out how to calculate your fat allowance,\nsee the sidebar Recommended Fat Intake, page 28, and to\ndetermine the total and saturated fat contents of some\nfoods, see the sidebar Where’s the Fat? page 28.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are a class of polyunsaturated fatty\nacids found in fish (tuna, mackerel, and salmon, in particular)\nand some plant oils such as canola (rapeseed) oil.  These\nfatty acids have made the news because of the observation that\npeople who frequently eat fish appear to be at lower risk for\ncoronary artery disease.  Omega-3 fatty acids also seem to\nplay a role in your ability to fight infection.\nHydrogenated fats are the result of a process in which\nunsaturated fats are treated to make them solid and more\nstable at room temperature.  The hydrogenation process,\nwhich involves the addition of hydrogen atoms, actually\nresults in a saturated fat.  Trans-fatty acids are created by\nhydrogenation.  An increase in consumption of these fats is\na concern because they have been associated with an increased\nrisk of coronary artery disease.  Hydrogenated fat is a common\ningredient in stick and tub margarine, commercial baked\ngoods, snack foods, and other processed foods.  \nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is a necessary\nconstituent of cell membranes and serves as a precursor for bile\nacids (essential for digestion), vitamin D, and an important\ngroup of hormones (the steroid hormones).  Our livers can\nmake virtually all of the cholesterol needed for these essen-\ntial functions.  Dietary cholesterol is found only in foods\nof animal origin, that is, meat, poultry, milk, butter, cheese,\nand eggs.  Foods of plant origin, that is, fruits, vegetables,\nnuts, seeds, legumes, grains, and the oils derived from them,\ndo not contain cholesterol.  Eggs are the food most often\nassociated with cholesterol, because the average large egg\ncontains about 210 milligrams of cholesterol (only in the\nyolk), and the recommended daily cholesterol intake is\n300 mg or less.  However, for most people, meat contributes\na higher proportion of cholesterol to the diet than do eggs,\nbecause cholesterol is found in both the lean and fat portions\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n27\n32%\n62%\n6%\nCanola\noil\nSafflower\noil\nSunflower\noil*\nCorn oil\nOlive oil\nSoybean\noil\nPeanut\noil\nChicken\nfat\nLard\nPalm oil\nBeef fat\nButterfat\nCoconut\noil\n79%\n12%\n9%\n68%\n21%\n9%\n62%\n25%\n13%\n9%\n77%\n14%\n60%\n25%\n15%\n34%\n48%\n18%\n22%\n47%\n31%\n12%\n47%\n41%\n10%\n39%\n51%\n4%\n4\n44%\n52%\n5%\n31%\n64%\n2%\n6%\n92%\nA COMPARISON OF FATS\n*Total is not 100% because of the presence of other, minor fat compounds.\nPercent polyunsaturated fat\nPercent monounsaturated fat\nPercent saturated fat\nof meat.  Shellfish have acquired an undeserved reputa-\ntion for being high in cholesterol.  Their cholesterol and\ntotal fat contents are actually comparatively low (see side-\nbar:  Cholesterol Content of Foods, page 29).\nFat Substitutes\nTo appeal to our desire for lower-fat substitutes for our\nfavorite high-fat foods, the commercial food industry has\ndeveloped low- or lower-fat versions of many foods using\nvarious fat replacers.  Until recently, fat replacers always\nconsisted of proteins or carbohydrates, such as starches or\ngels, but the kinds of foods that could be prepared with\nthese fat replacers were limited by their inability to withstand\nthe high temperatures of frying.  In 1996, after a long\nperiod of development, safety testing, and governmental\nreview, the first non-caloric fat, olestra, was approved by the\nFDA for use in the manufacture of savory (non-sweet) snacks\n(such as crackers and chips).  Because olestra is a modified\nfat, it is the first heat-resistant fat substitute, which allows\nit to be used to make fried foods.  In addition, olestra gives\nfoods the flavor and creamy “mouth feel” of high-fat foods.  \nFDA approval of olestra was controversial for two reasons.\nFirst, this artificial ingredient, if approved and accepted,\nwould be the first in history to be consumed in quantities\ncomparable to the quantities of fat, carbohydrates, and\nproteins we currently consume from food sources.  In other\nwords, these novel, previously unknown substances could\nbecome major parts of the diets of some people, and there\n28\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nCALORIES\nTOTAL FAT (GRAMS)\nSATURATED FAT (GRAMS)\nMost women & older adults\nAbout 1,600\n53\nLess than 17\nMost men, active women,\nteen girls & children\nAbout 2,200\n73\nLess than 24\nActive men & teen boys\nAbout 2,800\n93\nLess than 31\nNote:  These are guidelines for healthy individuals.

Some scientists predicted\nthat the substance would cause serious gastrointestinal\ncomplaints despite controlled studies demonstrating its\nsafety.  However, in the first year of availability of olestra-\ncontaining foods, the predicted intestinal problems were not\nsignificant.  Tests in which volunteers ate large quantities\nof olestra-containing potato chips or regular potato chips\nwithout knowing which type they were eating showed no\ndifferences in gastrointestinal complaints between the two\ngroups.  Second, tests of olestra showed that it inhibits the\nabsorption of  fat-soluble compounds (vitamins A, D, E,\nand K and some carotenoids) from foods eaten at the same\ntime as the olestra-containing foods, whereas it has no\neffect on the absorption of other nutrients or on the body’s\nstores of fat-soluble vitamins.  To compensate for this effect\nof olestra on fat-soluble vitamin absorption, foods pre-\npared with olestra have small amounts of these vitamins\nadded to them.  At this writing, the range of foods that can\ninclude olestra as a fat substitute is quite narrow.  Some\nquestions do remain about the long-term safety of the prod-\nuct, although long-term studies in young, growing animals\nand several studies in humans have shown no negative\neffects.\nHow should you decide whether to include foods with\nfat replacers in your eating plan, and how much of these\nfoods do you include?  From a health standpoint, small\namounts of olestra-containing foods appear to be harmless.\nBut from a purely nutritional standpoint, most foods that\ncontain fat replacers are snack foods essentially devoid of\nnutritional benefit.  In addition, these foods are not calorie-\nfree. Many remain high in calories, and some foods that\ncontain carbohydrate fat replacers are even higher in calories\nthan their higher-fat counterparts, so they are still calorie-\ndense, nutritionally poor foods.  It’s fine to choose small\namounts of these foods occasionally, but better low-fat\nsnack choices include fruits, vegetables, nonfat yogurt, and\nwhole-grain pretzels and breads.\nThe Bottom Line on Fats\nDietary fat is a source of energy, but high-fat diets, especially\ndiets high in saturated fat, increase the risk of gaining\nexcessive amounts of weight and of developing diabetes,\ncoronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and several\ntypes of cancer.  This increased risk is the reason that health\nexperts encourage us to reduce our intake of total and sat-\nurated fats by:\n•\nincreasing our intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole-\ngrain foods, which are naturally low in fat, and prepar-\ning them with a minimum of added fats\n•\nconsuming low-fat dairy products such as nonfat milk\nand yogurt and reduced-fat cheeses\n•\nlimiting our intake of red meat, poultry, and fish to 5\nto 7 ounces daily\n•\nchoosing lean cuts of red meat and poultry, removing\nthe skin before eating poultry, and preparing the meat\nwith a method that uses little or no additional fats\n•\nchoosing some fish that is high in omega-3 fatty acids\nand preparing it with little or no added fat\nTHE MICRONUTRIENTS:\nVITAMINS AND MINERALS\nVitamins and minerals are required by every process in your\nbody.  Unlike the macronutrients, vitamins and minerals\nby themselves do not contain energy.  Instead, they work\nwith the energy-rich macronutrients—carbohydrates, pro-\ntein, and fats—and with each other to help your body to\nrelease, use, and store the energy from those macronutrients.\nVitamins\nVitamins are small but complex molecules.  In addition\nto helping us to use and store energy from macronutrients,\nthey assist the molecules responsible for vision to perform\ntheir function, they serve as regulatory hormones for bone\nformation, and they act as antioxidants to preserve cellular\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n29\nFOOD\nSERVING SIZE\nCHOLESTEROL\n(IN MILLIGRAMS)\nChicken without \nthe skin, lean \nbeef or pork\n3 oz\n70-80\nEgg\n1\nAbout 210\nKing crab\n3 oz\n45\nLobster\n3 oz\n60\nOrgan meat (liver)\n3 oz\n330\nShrimp\n3 oz\n165\nCHOLESTEROL CONTENT OF FOODS\nCholesterol is found only in animal products.  Below is a list\nof common foods and their cholesterol content.\nfunction (see Vitamins and Minerals as Antioxidants, page\n31).\nEach of the vitamins was discovered and its require-\nment determined by its ability to cure and prevent a\nparticular disease or group of symptoms.  For example, the\ndiscovery that a substance in limes could cure and prevent\nthe disease called scurvy led to the discovery that our bodies\nrequire  vitamin C and that scurvy is the result of vitamin\nC deficiency.  Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are being\nestablished for each vitamin.  They describe the amount of\nthe vitamin that should prevent symptoms of deficiency\nin most people, with a little extra added.\nToday, the diseases that result from vitamin deficiencies\nrarely occur except in severely malnourished individuals\nor in those with certain medical conditions.  Rather, in a\nvirtual nutrition revolution, research has progressed beyond\nthe identification and treatment of simple nutrient\ndeficiencies to the realization that some of the vitamins\n(or foods that contain them) may help maintain health by\npreventing the development of chronic diseases such as\ncancer and heart disease in otherwise well-nourished people.  \nThe Food Guide Pyramid is based on the DRIs.  It tells\nus the number of servings, in each group of foods, that will\nsupply us with the recommended allowance of most of the\nvitamins.  Nutrition research also has begun to support the\nidea that a few of the vitamins and minerals, notably those\nreferred to as antioxidants (see Vitamins and Minerals as\nAntioxidants, page 31), may provide even more benefit if\ntaken in quantities somewhat greater than the recom-\nmended amounts.  This idea raises some questions.  Is there\nsuch a thing as too much of a vitamin?  Should these extra\nvitamins come from food, or is it okay to take a supplement\nif you just can’t eat that much?  And, should the recom-\nmended amounts for these vitamins be increased?  Although\nthere really is no answer to the last question yet, the answers\nto the first two questions depend on the type of vitamin.\nAs we begin our discussion of vitamins, we want to empha-\nsize that although it is virtually impossible to overdose on\nvitamins from food alone, some vitamin supplements def-\ninitely offer too much of a good thing (see sidebar:  What\nAre Daily Values? this page, and Supplement Sense, page\n38).\nThe 14 essential vitamins can be classified into two\ngroups:  water-soluble and fat-soluble.  They are classified on\nthe basis of their molecular structure, which determines\nthe way the vitamins are carried in food and in the blood-\nstream and the manner in which they are stored in your\nbody.  The text that follows describes which vitamins fall\ninto which category and what that means for your health.\nWater-Soluble Vitamins\nThere are 10 water-soluble vitamins.  The B complex vitamins\nhave various roles, some of which involve their action, in\nconcert, to regulate the body’s use of energy from food.  Folic\nacid is an important factor in the regulation of growth.  During\nthe early stages of pregnancy, folic acid is important for\npreventing a type of birth defect known as a neural tube\ndefect.  Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, functions\nin various ways, many of which seem to be related to its\nantioxidant properties (see the Appendix:  A Quick Look—\nVitamins, Their Functions and Food Sources, page 430).\nAs their name implies, water-soluble vitamins dissolve\nin water.  The body strives to maintain the optimal level of\neach of the water-soluble vitamins for its immediate needs.\nSurplus water-soluble vitamins are excreted in the urine\nand through perspiration, because they are not stored in\nthe body to any appreciable extent.  Water-soluble vitamins\nmust be replenished almost daily, preferably by eating foods\nthat are rich in these vitamins.  Fruits, vegetables, grains, and\nbeans are excellent sources of the water-soluble vitamins\n(with the exception of vitamin B12, which is found only in\nfoods of animal origin).  However, if you choose to use\n30\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nHave you ever wondered what “% Daily Value” means on\nthe Nutrition Facts label? How does it relate to the\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)?  As you may recall\nfrom Chapter 1, the DRIs, set by the Food and Nutrition\nBoard of the National Academy of Sciences, are the\namounts of each nutrient recommended for most healthy\npeople.  Because DRIs are both sex- and age-specific,\neach nutrient has a range of DRIs.  To make it easier to\nshow how a food meets your recommended allowance for\nsome of the more critical nutrients, the Food and Drug\nAdministration has established a Daily Value for each\nnutrient, which is approximately the highest recommended\namount for that nutrient.  The “% Daily Value” reported\non the Nutrition Facts label is based on a maintenance\ncalorie level of 2,000 calories daily.  If your maintenance\ncalorie level is 1,500 calories, your daily values may be a\nbit lower, so the nutrient contents of the food satisfy a\nhigher percentage of your daily value.\nWHAT ARE DAILY VALUES?\nmultivitamins or single-nutrient supplements to get your\nwater-soluble vitamins, moderation is advised (see\nSupplement Sense, page 38), because high doses of several\nof the B vitamins can have harmful effects, and high doses\nof vitamin C may contribute to the formation of kidney\nstones.\nFat-Soluble Vitamins\nThe fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K, are found in the\nfood you eat,  absorbed into your bloodstream, and carried\nthroughout your body attached to fat molecules.  Because\nfat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body, they do not\nneed to be replenished on a daily basis.  Vitamins A and D\nare stored in the liver, and reserve supplies may be sufficient\nfor as long as 6 months.  Reserves of vitamin K, however,\nmay be sufficient for only a few weeks, and the supply of\nvitamin E can last somewhere between several days and\nseveral months.  \nIf taken in excess, usually in the form of a supplement,\nfat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body.  Large\nstores of vitamins A and D can actually become harmful.\nFortunately, it is difficult to get an excess of fat-soluble\nvitamins from food.  For example, beta-carotene, the\nmolecule found in some foods of plant origin that gives\ncarrots and squash their yellow-orange color, is converted\nto vitamin A in the body.  But because the chemical reaction\nthat converts beta-carotene to vitamin A is carefully\nregulated, it is nearly impossible to get vitamin A toxicity\nfrom eating fruits and vegetables.  Foods that provide\nvitamins D, E, and K would need to be consumed in such\nquantity that achieving toxic levels of these nutrients is\nhighly unlikely.  However, a high intake of vitamin K-\ncontaining foods may contribute to abnormal bleeding in\npeople who are receiving blood-thinning (anticoagulant)\nmedication.  Therefore, it is important to keep foods that are\nhigh in vitamin K relatively constant.  Vitamin E supplements\nalso are not recommended for these individuals.\nThe recent development of diet drugs that work by\ninhibiting your body’s absorption of fat has raised concerns\nabout the possibility that the use of such drugs could lead\nto deficiencies in the fat-soluble vitamins.  Preliminary\nresults suggest that when taken as directed, these drugs\nmay interfere with the absorption of beta-carotene and\nvitamin D from foods.  If these findings are confirmed,\npersons who take these prescribed drugs to manage their\nweight also will be required to take a daily multiple vitamin\nthat contains the fat-soluble vitamin.\nAs mentioned in the discussion of fat substitutes, early\nresearch on the fat substitute olestra showed that eating\nolestra-containing snack foods interferes with the body’s\nability to absorb some of the fat-soluble vitamins from the\nother foods we eat.  To compensate for this effect, the man-\nufacturers of snack foods that contain olestra were required\nto fortify these products with fat-soluble vitamins.  Thus,\neating olestra-containing snack foods does not seem to cre-\nate a significant risk for deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins\n(unless you consistently choose to eat them in place of\nmore nutritious foods).\nTo learn about the many roles of vitamins, how much\nof each of them you need, and the best food sources for\neach one, see the Appendix:  A Quick Look—Vitamins,\nTheir Functions and Food Sources, page 430.\nMinerals\nMinerals are just what the term indicates—elements found\nin the earth.  Like the vitamins, minerals play a multitude\nof roles in our bodies.  Unlike the vitamins, some minerals—\ncalcium and phosphorus—have a structural function.  These\nminerals are the main components of our bones and teeth.\nCalcium has an additional critical role.  Along with several\nother major minerals—sodium, chlorine, potassium, and\nmagnesium—calcium is a regulator of cell function.  The\nminerals sodium, chloride, and potassium (also referred to\nas electrolytes) are responsible for maintaining the balance\nof fluids inside and outside of cells and, along with calcium,\ncontrolling the movement of nerve impulses.\nTrace minerals are those that your body needs in smaller\namounts, usually less than 20 milligrams daily.  These\ninclude iron, chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodine,\nmanganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc.  The\nmineral iron forms the active part of hemoglobin, the\nprotein in your blood that delivers oxygen to different\nsites in your body and picks up carbon dioxide.  Although\nDRIs have been established for some of the trace minerals,\nthose for which too little is known to establish precise\nDRIs have a recommended Adequate Intake (AI) (see\nthe Appendix:  A Quick Look—Minerals, Their Functions\nand Food Sources, page 432).\nVitamins and Minerals as Antioxidants\nSeveral vitamins and minerals are considered antioxidants.\nThese include vitamins E and C, beta-carotene (which can\nbe converted to vitamin A), other carotenoids (some may\nbe converted to vitamin A and also play a role in cell devel-\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n31\nopment), and the minerals selenium, copper, zinc, and\nmanganese.  What are antioxidants?  What do they do?\nEvery cell in our body needs oxygen to use the nutrients\nthat food provides.  However, when oxygen is used by cells,\nby-products called free radicals are formed.  If allowed to\naccumulate, these free radicals can damage tissues, cells,\nand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the genetic material of\ncells).  The process of oxidative damage can be observed as\nthe browning that occurs when sliced apples or potatoes are\nexposed to the air or the rancid flavor that butter and\ncooking oils develop when stored for long periods.\nEnvironmental pollutants such as cigarette smoke and\nultraviolet light from the sun also contribute to the for-\nmation of free radicals in our bodies.  Although not proved,\nstudies suggest that excess free-radical production can\nincrease the risk of cancer, heart disease, cataracts, and the\nother types of cell deterioration that are associated with\naging.\nJust as the vitamin C in lemon juice can prevent sliced\napples from browning, antioxidants scavenge and neutralize\nthe effects of free radicals in our bodies.  Each antioxidant\nhas its own unique effect.  Vitamin C, which is water-\n32\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nCAROTENOIDS\nBeta-carotene—carrots, broccoli, sweet potatoes, greens\n(dandelion, turnip, beet, spinach), squash (butternut,\nHubbard), red bell peppers, apricots, cantaloupe, mango\nAlpha-carotene—greens (see above), carrots, squash \n(see above), corn, green peppers, potatoes, apples, plums,\ntomatoes\nLycopene—tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit\nVITAMIN C\nBell peppers (red and green), guavas, greens (see above),\nbroccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, strawberries,\npapayas, oranges and grapefruits and their juices\nVITAMIN E\nPolyunsaturated vegetable oils, seeds, nuts, fortified cereals,\ngreens (see above), tomato products\nSELENIUM\nWheat germ, Brazil nuts, whole-wheat bread, bran, oats,\nturnips, brown rice, orange juice\nFOOD SOURCES OF ANTIOXIDANTS\nSome of the many food sources of antioxidants.\nsoluble, removes free radicals from body fluids and cell\nstructures composed mainly of water.  Beta-carotene and vit-\namin E are fat-soluble.  They seem to be active primarily in\nfat tissues and cell membranes throughout the body.  The\nmineral selenium is an antioxidant that assists vitamin E.  \nWhat is the best source of antioxidants?  With the\npossible exception of vitamin E, the best source of antiox-\nidants is food (see Supplements:  Foods, or Functional\nFoods? page 34).  Fruits, vegetables, and grains provide a\nwide variety of both known and yet to be discovered\nantioxidants that appear to protect your body’s vital\nfunctions.\nWATER\nAs an essential nutrient, water is the most often overlooked\nand taken for granted.  Yet 75 percent of our body weight\nis water.  Water contributes to nearly every major process\nin our bodies.  It keeps our body temperature stable, main-\ntains body chemicals at their proper concentrations, carries\nnutrients and oxygen to cells, and removes waste products.\nWater also cushions joints and protects organs and tissues. \nAn insufficient intake of water or excessive loss of water\ncan result in dehydration and heat exhaustion, a condi-\ntion characterized by dizziness, vomiting, muscle cramps,\nfatigue, and confusion.  Fortunately, under most circum-\nstances our bodies are good at telling us when we are nearing\ndehydration.  When we feel thirsty, our bodies need water.\nHowever, as we get older, our bodies’ ability to sense dehy-\ndration decreases, and older adults often lose the sense of\nthirst.  Our need for water increases with exercise; exposure\nto hot or even warm, dry, or extremely cold conditions;\npregnancy and breastfeeding; and the use of some\nmedications.  Nutritionists recommend that we drink 8\nor more 8-ounce glasses of water daily.  Many fruits and\nvegetables are 80 to 90 percent water.  Therefore, in addition\nto the vitamins and minerals they supply, fruits and\nvegetables  also contribute to our total water intake.  For\nmore information on water, see Part II, Encyclopedia of\nFoods, page 150.\nON THE NUTRIENT HORIZON:\nPHYTOCHEMICALS\nCarotenoids.  Isoflavones.  Capsaicins.  You may have heard\nthese words in radio advertisements for the latest supplement\nor seen them in last week’s newspaper.  But what are they?  All\nof them fall into the category of substances called phyto-\nchemicals or phytonutrients.  A phytochemical is, literally,\nany chemical found in a plant (phyto is the Greek word for\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n33\nWhen oxygen is used by cells, by-\nproducts called free radicals are\nnaturally formed.  Free radicals\nare molecules with a missing\nelectron.  Simply put, free radicals\n“want” their full share of electrons.\nThey will take electrons from\nvital cell structures, causing\ndamage and leading to disease.\nAntioxidants are able to donate\nelectrons.  Nutrients such as\nvitamin C, vitamin E, or beta-\ncarotene are antioxidants that\nblock some of this damage by\ndonating electrons to stabilize\nand neutralize the harmful \neffects of free radicals.\nFree radical\nAntioxidant\nCell\n34\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nplant).  Armed with the knowledge that people whose diets\nare rich in foods of plant origin are at lower risk for many\nserious diseases, nutritional scientists have begun to try to\nisolate the actual chemicals in foods that may be responsible\nfor promoting health and preventing disease.  Nutritionists\nhave adopted the term “phytochemical” or “phytonutrient”\nto refer to any one of a growing list of substances they have\nisolated that appear to prevent disease in laboratory animals.  \nThe phytochemicals identified so far are known to have\nvarious roles in the plants from which they originate,\nincluding capturing the energy from sunlight and confer-\nring resistance to infection by fungi, bacteria, and viruses.\nHow they function in our bodies, and how they may be\nresponsible (along with the known vitamins, minerals, and\nfiber found in plant foods) for the health-promoting effects,\nis just beginning to be understood.\nThe antioxidant beta-carotene is one of a group of phy-\ntochemicals known as carotenoids.  Beta-carotene, the\nsubstance that gives carrots their orange color and their\nname, is converted to vitamin A (retinol) in our body.\nOther carotenoids include lutein and zeaxanthin (from\ngreen vegetables) and lycopene (from tomatoes).  Diets\nrich in foods containing carotenoids have been associated\nwith a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease.  Researchers\nare also investigating whether lutein-rich diets may be\nlinked to a lower risk for macular degeneration, a disease\nof the retina that may lead to blindness.  \nThe isoflavones found in soybeans are associated with\nlower blood cholesterol and a decreased risk for coronary\nartery disease.  In addition, isoflavones, which are also\nreferred to as phytoestrogens (estrogen-like molecules iso-\nlated from plants), appear to reduce some of the symp-\ntoms of menopause and may confer a lower risk for breast\nand other cancers (see sidebar:  Soy What? this page).  For\nhealth benefits, 20 to 25 grams of soy protein per day is rec-\nommended.  For some of the other phytochemicals that\nhave been identified, see the sidebar Phytochemicals:  A\nFood Pharmacy That May Fight Disease, page 35.\nAlthough some phytochemicals are now available in\npill form, we do not yet know enough about how they\nfunction to assume that any one, on its own, will promote\nhealth and prevent disease without the presence of the\nvitamins, minerals, fiber, and other, as yet unidentified,\nsubstances in plant foods.  Scientists are making progress\nin determining how phytochemicals work, but the best\nway to ensure an adequate intake of all potentially health-\npromoting substances in foods of plant origin is to eat the\nfoods themselves—fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds,\nand whole grains.  See the Appendix:  Phytochemical\nContents of Selected Foods, page 484.\nSUPPLEMENTS:  FOODS, OR\nFUNCTIONAL FOODS?\nSupplements are concentrated forms of vitamins, minerals,\nfiber, amino acids, fatty acids, herbal products, enzymes,\nplant or animal tissue extracts, or hormones.  Some sup-\nplements contain one or two known nutrients or a small\ngroup of nutrients such as B vitamins or antioxidants.\nThere is increasing evidence that isoflavones, plant estro-\ngens found in soy foods, may have some of the same\neffects as estrogen.  Beneficial effects may include:\n•\nLower blood lipid levels—Soy may decrease total\ncholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and\ntriglycerides.\n•\nDecreased cancer risk—Cancer population studies\nshow a decreased risk for hormone-related cancers \nof the breast, ovary, endometrium, and prostate in\ncountries where plant-based diets with a high content\nof phytoestrogens are consumed.\n•\nDiminished menopausal symptoms—Population\nstudies show that \nwomen who eat \nsoy as their main \nprotein source may \nhave far fewer distressing \nmenopausal symptoms. \nSOY WHAT?\nCOMMON SOY FOODS\nPROTEIN\nCALORIES\n(GRAMS)\n1/3 cup roasted soy nuts\n23\n260\n1/2 cup soybeans, mature, cooked\n14\n150\n1/2 cup soybeans, green, cooked\n11\n126\n1 cup soy milk\n7\n80\n3 ounces tofu, silken, firm\n6\n50\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n35\nPHYTOCHEMICALS\nA Food Pharmacy That May Fight Disease\nAllyl sulfides\nAlpha-linoleic acid\nAnthocyanosides\nCapsaicins\nCarotenoids, including lycopene,\nlutein\nCatechins\nCellulose (fiber)\nCoumarins\nEllagic acid\nFlavonoids (including resveratrol)\nGums (fiber)\nHemicellulose (fiber)\nIndoles\nIsoflavones \nIsothiocyanates\nLignins (fiber)\nMonoterpenes\nPectin (fiber)\nPhenolic acids\nProtease inhibitors\nPhytosterols\nSaponins\nGarlic, onions, leeks\nFlaxseed, soybeans, walnuts\nEggplant, blood oranges, blueberries\nChili peppers\nOrange, red, yellow fruits; many \nvegetables, including tomatoes\nTea (especially green tea)\nWhole-wheat flour, bran, cruciferous and root\nvegetables, legumes, apples\nCarrots, citrus fruits, parsley\nStrawberries, raspberries, \nblueberries\nCitrus fruits, onions, apples, grapes, \nwine, tea\nOats, barley, legumes\nBran, whole grains\nCruciferous vegetables\nSoybeans and soy products\nCruciferous vegetables\nWhole grains, oranges, pears, broccoli, flaxseed\nCitrus fruits\nApples, citrus fruits, strawberries\nBrown rice, green tea\nSoybeans, all plants\nLegumes, cucumbers\nGarlic, onions, licorice, legumes\nMay protect against coronary artery \ndisease, abnormal blood clotting, cancer\nDecreases inflammation\nMay protect against cancer\nTopical analgesic\nMay protect against coronary artery dis-\nease, macular degeneration, and cancer \nMay protect against cancer\nMay protect against colon cancer,  \ncoronary artery disease\nMay protect against blood clots\nMay protect against cancer\nMay protect against cancer\nMay prevent colon cancer\nMay prevent colon cancer\nMay protect against cancer\nMay diminish menopausal symptoms;\nmay protect against cancer, may \nlower blood lipid levels, may improve\nbone health\nMay prevent lung, esophageal cancer\nMay protect against cancer\nMay protect against cancer (pancreatic,\nbreast, prostate tumors)\nMay protect against cancer, coronary\nartery disease, diabetes\nMay protect against cancer\nMay protect against cancer\nMay help prevent coronary artery\ndisease and breast cancer\nMay protect against cancer\nPHYTOCHEMICAL\nFOOD\nPOTENTIAL BENEFIT\n36\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nOthers, like the well-known multivitamins, may contain an\nentire panel of vitamins and minerals in amounts close to\nthe Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).  Still other supple-\nments may not contain any substances yet identified as\nnutrients or even demonstrated as beneficial to health.  \nWith few exceptions, foods are better sources than sup-\nplements for the nutrients we need.  A diet based on the\nFood Guide Pyramid, especially one that is rich in fruits,\nvegetables, whole-grain foods, and legumes, will provide\nmost of the nutrients we know we need and the ones we\nhave not yet identified.  When we build our diet on a foun-\ndation of whole foods, we reap the added benefit of\nphytochemicals (known and unknown) and all the types of\nfiber we have begun to realize are important for health.  \nDietary supplements can be enticing.  However, because\nof a law passed in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and\nEducation Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nis more limited in what it can do to regulate the safety,\npurity, and labeling of supplements than what it does for\ndrugs or even foods.  Supplement manufacturers are\nrequired to list the ingredients of their products but are\nnot accountable for the validity of those lists.  Supplements\nmay contain more or less of the active ingredient than they\nclaim or may contain various impurities.  Moreover,\nmanufacturers are not required to list possible side effects\nof supplements on labels or in promotional materials (see\nsidebar:  A Closer Look:  Supplements and the Law, this\npage).  Finally, we don’t yet know the active ingredient or\ningredients in many herbal supplements and plant foods,\nso we have no way of knowing whether the commercially\navailable extracts of those herbs or foods will have the same\nbenefits as the foods themselves.\nHerbal Supplements \nThe popularity of herbal products, those made from extracts\nof plants and believed to have medicinal properties, continues\nto increase.  Americans spend $700 million a year on herbal\nremedies.  The use of some plant remedies dates back\nthousands of years, and plant materials are the basis for\nmany of our most helpful medications, including aspirin\nand morphine.  Scientists continue to investigate and\ndiscover new medicinal uses for substances in plants (see\nsidebar:  Herbal Products, page 37).  \nEven though some herbal remedies may show benefi-\ncial effects, most show little evidence of providing any\nhealth benefits.  In fact, some may have serious health risks\nand may interfere with the action of some medicines.\nBecause herbal products are considered dietary supple-\nments rather than drugs, the FDA is limited in its ability\nto regulate these substances.  Ongoing studies continue to\ninvestigate selected herbs for their safety and effectiveness,\nso that more information will be available to consumers\nin the future.  There is no guarantee of quality control.  In\nthe meantime, follow these precautions when considering\na supplement:\n•\nDo not use herbal remedies for treatment of serious\nillnesses.\n•\nDo not give herbal (or other) supplements to infants\nand children.\n•\nAvoid all herbal supplements if you are pregnant or\ntrying to become pregnant.\nWhen a dietary supplement is available in the store, it is\nnaturally assumed that it is safe.  Some government\nagency has checked to make certain it is not harmful,\nright?  Not anymore.\nIn 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and\nEducation Act removed dietary supplements from pre-\nmarket safety evaluations required of food ingredients\nand drugs.  Drugs and food ingredients still undergo a\nlengthy Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety\nreview before they can be marketed, but the 1994 legis-\nlation eliminated the FDA’s authority to regulate the\nsafety of nutritional supplements before they go on the\nmarket.  Now, the FDA can intervene only after an ill-\nness or injury occurs.\nClaims may not be made about the use of dietary\nsupplements to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure a spe-\ncific disease.  For example, a product may not carry the\nclaim \"cures cancer\" or \"treats arthritis.\"\nThe FDA can still restrict the sale of an unsafe\ndietary supplement when there is evidence that the\nproduct presents a significant or reasonable safety con-\ncern.  But the agency must wait for complaints about a\nproduct before acting.\nThe legislation also changed guidelines for market-\ning supplements.  Because the nutritional supplement\nindustry is now largely unregulated, there is no guaran-\ntee of product purity or of the amount of active ingredi-\nent in a supplement—even from one package to the\nnext of the same product.\nA CLOSER LOOK:  SUPPLEMENTS AND THE LAW\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n37\nHERBAL PRODUCTS\nChamomile\nMatricaria chamomilla\nComfrey\nSymphytum officinale\nPurple coneflower\nEchinacea\nEphedra-containing compounds\nMa-huang\nGarlic\nAllium sativum\nGinger\nZingiber officinale\nGinkgo\nGinkgo biloba\nGinseng\nPanax ginseng\nGuarana\nPaullinia cupana\nIndian tobacco\nLobelia inflata\nKava\nPiper methysticum\nSt. John’s wort\nHypericum perforatum\nSaw palmetto\nSerenoa repens\nYohimbe bark\nPausinystalia yohimba\nInternally for indigestion and as an \nanti-inflammatory.

Those\nthat contain more than 100 percent of your estimated daily\nneeds may result in serious nutrient imbalances or even\ntoxicity.  Such imbalances do not occur when your source of\nvitamins comes from foods rather than supplements, because\nfoods contain safe amounts of multiple nutrients, and if you\nfollow the Food Guide Pyramid’s recommended number of\nservings you will likely meet the recommended amounts for\nmost nutrients.\nAs discussed earlier, most Americans, including athletes,\nconsume considerably more protein than recommended,\nand more than their bodies can use.  Protein or amino acid\npowders provide no benefit and are a poor substitute for\nprotein-rich foods that contain necessary vitamins and\nminerals.  Similarly, pills that promise to deliver all the\nfiber we need daily are a bad risk, because these pills invari-\nably provide only one type of fiber, whereas each type of\nfiber found in foods of plant origin appears to confer unique\nhealth-promoting benefits.  The fatty acids we need also are\navailable in more than adequate amounts in various foods.\nWho Needs a Vitamin or Mineral Supplement? \nEating a variety of foods, especially those of plant origin,\nallows most of us to acquire all the known nutrients, food\nsubstances, and as yet unidentified nutrients that our bodies\nneed.  Nevertheless, supplements may be appropriate for\nsome individuals.  Who are these people?\n•\nPregnant or breastfeeding women have an increased\nneed for most vitamins and minerals.  Folic acid is espe-\ncially important early in pregnancy.  Women who are\ncapable of becoming pregnant should ensure that their\ndaily intake of folic acid from supplements and fortified\nfoods is 400 micrograms.  These vitamins and minerals\nare contained in the prenatal supplements that are\nprescribed by your health care provider.\n•\nOlder adults may absorb some nutrients poorly, partic-\nularly folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D.  They there-\nfore may require supplements.\n•\nPeople on restricted diets may require supplements of\nsome vitamins and minerals.\n•\nPeople with diseases of the digestive tract or other serious\nillnesses that limit their absorption of some vitamins\nand minerals may require supplements.\n•\nPeople taking prescription medications may have altered\nneeds for a variety of nutrients.\n•\nSmokers appear to have an increased need for antioxi-\ndants, especially vitamin C.  (However, even this\nincreased requirement for vitamin C is easily satisfied\nby eating nutrient-rich foods.)  \n•\nPeople who drink alcohol to excess may require\nsupplements.\n38\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nSupplements are not substitutes.  Supplements do not\nreplace the hundreds of nutrients in whole foods needed\nfor a balanced diet, and they will not fix poor eating\nhabits.  If you are considering taking a supplement, heed\nthe following:\n•\nDo not self-prescribe.\n•\nSee your doctor or health care provider if you have \na health problem.\n•\nDiscuss any supplement that you are taking.\nSupplements may interfere with medications.\n•\nRead the label.  Supplements can lose their potency\nover time, so check the expiration date  on the label.\nAlso, look for the initials \"USP.\"  They stand for the\ntesting organization, US Pharmacopeia, which estab-\nlishes testing standards for compounds.  The Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) does not analyze\nsupplements before they enter the marketplace.\n•\nStick to the Daily Value (DV).  Choose supplements\nthat are limited to 100 percent or less.  Take no more\nthan what is recommended by your doctor or health\ncare provider.  The toxic levels are not known for\nsome nutrients.\n•\nDo not waste dollars.  Synthetic supplements are the\nsame as so-called natural types.  Generic and synthetic\nbrands are less expensive and equally effective.\n•\nStore in a safe place.  Iron supplements are the most\ncommon cause of poisoning deaths among children.\nUSING SUPPLEMENTS\n•\nVegetarians who eat no animal products may not get\nadequate vitamin B12, iron, and zinc.  Vegetarians who\navoid  dairy products are at a greater risk for calcium\ndeficiency than are those who do eat dairy products.\n•\nSome evidence suggests that a daily supplement of\nvitamin E may reduce the risk of heart disease.\nBefore taking any supplement, discuss it with your health\ncare provider, and be sure to mention any medications you\nare taking (see sidebar:  Using Supplements, page 38).\nThe Future Is Here:  Functional Foods\nIf your breakfast this morning included calcium-fortified\norange juice and toast made with folate-enriched flour,\nyou are a consumer of functional foods.  Just what is a\nfunctional food?  As the fastest growing category of new\nfood products, these are foods or food components to\nwhich manufacturers have added ingredients that are\nknown or believed to promote health and prevent disease\n(see Chapter 4, What Do the Terms “Fortified” and\n“Enriched” Mean? page 92). Although the name “func-\ntional foods” is new, the concept is not: when it was dis-\ncovered in the early part of the 20th century that some\nthyroid disease was caused by a deficiency of the mineral\niodine, manufacturers began enriching table salt with\niodine.  Since that time, we have also seen vitamin D-for-\ntified milk, breakfast cereals fortified with a variety of vit-\namins and minerals, and the addition of preservatives that\nare themselves antioxidants to almost all processed foods\n(see Chapter 3, Cholesterol-Lowering Margarine, page\n66).  The past few years, though, have seen a virtual explo-\nsion of functional foods, some based on careful research and\nsupported by nutrition experts and some with question-\nable, if any, potential benefits. \nThe Bottom Line on Supplements\nWith a few exceptions, most of us should get all the\nvitamins, minerals, fiber, essential fatty acids, protein, and\nphytochemicals we need from the food we eat, rather than\nfrom supplements.  Always consult your health care\nprovider before trying a supplement.  A few of the func-\ntional foods that have recently appeared on the market have\nproven benefits, although most have yet to demonstrate\ntheir value.  \nIf your goal is to eat foods that deliver on their promise\nof providing all the necessary vitamins, minerals, fiber, and\nother yet to be identified health-enhancing substances, you\nneed to:\n•\nincrease your intake of whole grains, fruits, and veg-\netables as sources of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phy-\ntochemicals\n•\ndecrease your intake of foods of animal origin (meats,\ndairy products, eggs), particularly those that are high in\nsaturated fat, substituting lean alternatives and plant\nsources of protein\n•\nlimit your use of fats and cooking oils when preparing,\nserving, and eating food\nNUTRITION AND YOUR STAGE OF LIFE\nChoosing to eat wisely throughout life is one of the most\nimportant components of living a healthful lifestyle.  Using\nthe Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Food Guide\nPyramid as standards for your food choices and amounts, you\nwill be well on your way to establishing healthful eating\nhabits for your entire life.  Unfortunately, many people\nbecome discouraged by nutrition advice because they mis-\ntakenly think they cannot eat their favorite foods.\nA more positive and encouraging approach is to consider\nthat no food is forbidden.  Good health comes from eating\na variety of foods—meats, dairy products, and especially\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n39\nvegetables, fruits, and grains—in sensible amounts.  Keep\nin mind that your sex, age, weight, and health status are also\nimportant considerations when it comes to determining\nyour nutritional needs and maintaining good health\nthroughout life.  In other words, what is nutritionally right\nfor one person may not be the same for you.  \nIn the following pages, you will explore several natural\ntransition points during a lifetime which prompt variances\nin nutritional needs.  These specific times of life, from\ninfancy to preschooler, school-age to adolescence and teen\nyears, to young and then older adulthood, are important to\nunderstanding the changes you can expect as you age and\nthe strategies needed to meet your need for specific nutri-\nents and optimal health.\nInfancy \nNo human being grows more rapidly than an infant.  On\naverage, a baby triples his or her weight during the first\nyear and grows taller by 50 percent.  A newborn may grow\nfrom 7 pounds to 14 pounds in just 6 months, then to 20\nor 21 pounds by the end of the first full year.  It is easy to\nunderstand why proper nourishment for infants can pro-\nvide a healthy head start on life.\nBreast milk contains just the right balance of nutrients\nsuch as protein, carbohydrates, and fat.  It also provides\nthe infant with antibodies to fight some common childhood\nillnesses, and it may be unique in that it decreases the risk\nof food allergies.  Breast milk is also easy for the baby to\ndigest.\nMothers who cannot or choose not to breastfeed can still\nprovide good nourishment to their infants with bottle feed-\ning of commercial formulas.  Careful preparation is required\nfor each feeding, and formulas must be stored safely.\nAs a baby becomes more hungry, it is best to increase the\nfrequency of the breast- or bottle-feedings.  Most nutri-\ntion experts recommend that solid food should not be\nstarted until after the fourth month.  Many suggest wait-\ning until your baby is at least 6 months old.   Although\nbabies may be ready for solid foods in a few weeks or\nmonths, the decision to start giving solid foods should be\nbased on a baby's daytime behavior and eating habits and\ncoordinated with a baby's increasing nutritional needs.\nEven if solid foods are started, breast milk or formula should\ncontinue to be included in a baby’s diet for at least 1 year.\nA baby's first solid food will probably be cereal.  Cereal\nis a versatile food because it can be mixed very thin for\nbabies just starting on solid foods and can be thickened as\nbabies work on chewing and swallowing.  After cereals,\nfruits and vegetables are easiest for babies to digest. \nFrom 9 months on, babies make a gradual transition\ninto toddlerhood and develop a feeding schedule that mim-\nics the family’s mealtimes.  Sometime after 12 months,\nbabies may be on a schedule of three meals a day with the\nfamily and breast milk, formula, or snacks between meals.  \nBy 1 year of age, babies may have as many as four to six\nteeth and be developing a more defined and stronger chew-\ning motion.  With these developments, babies can handle\nfoods of thicker consistency, such as lumpy or chopped\nfoods.  Continue offering new solid foods at the rate of\none new food a week.  One of the most important con-\nsiderations at this age is offering baby food in a form that\nis appropriate to the baby's development.  Any solid food\nshould be tender and soft enough to be easily squashed\nwith your fingers.\nThe typical meal for a 1-year-old includes 1 tablespoon\nfrom each of the major food groups: milk, meat, vegetables,\nfruits, breads, and cereal grains.  That menu may translate\ninto a tablespoon of cooked carrots, two bites of rice, a taste\n40\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nBreastfeeding provides the right balance of nutrients—and more.\nof meat, and a couple bites of pear.    Try to feed your child\nat regular intervals while paying attention to cues that may\nsuggest that your child is hungry.\nGood eating habits begin early (see sidebar:  Infant\nNutrition at a Glance, above).\nPreschool Years: Ages 1 to 5\nAs babies become toddlers, they make the transition into\neating food the rest of the family eats.  The rapid weight gain\ncharacterized during the first year levels off during the\nsecond, with an average gain of 5 to 6 pounds.  Because a\nchild is not growing at the same rate as during infancy, he\nor she may not want the same quantities of food that were\nonce enjoyed.  Some preschoolers may be uninterested in\neating, whereas others seem finicky. Sometimes preschoolers\nare reluctant to try new foods or expand their food reper-\ntoire beyond three or four favorites.  There are several things\nyou can do to help overcome these challenges without forc-\ning a child to eat (see sidebar:  Tips for Feeding Toddlers,\npage 42).\nBy this time, a child should be eating foods from each\nof the food groups represented in the Food Guide Pyramid.\nHowever, do not expect a preschooler to eat a completely\nbalanced diet every day.  When allowed to choose from a\nselection of nutritionally sound foods, most children tend\nto select diets that, over several days, offer the necessary\nbalance.\nUntil age 2, fat should not be limited in a child's diet.\nDietary fat and cholesterol are important for an infant's\ngrowth.  After age 2, children can begin to consume fats in\nmoderation just as the rest of the family does.  This type of\ndiet includes grain foods, vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy\nproducts, lean meats, and their substitutes. \nKeep in mind that every child's energy needs are different.\nThus, snacks are often appropriate for children, especially\nfor smaller preschoolers who cannot eat enough to satisfy\ntheir energy needs all at once.  Small amounts of various\nfoods eaten frequently over the course of the day as a snack\nare healthful and normal.  However, completely uncon-\ntrolled snacking can diminish a child's appetite for meals.\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n41\nBreastfeeding is preferred\n•\nMeets baby's special nutrient needs\n•\nProtects against infection\n•\nMay protect against food allergies\n•\nTo be major part of baby's diet for at least 1 year\nWhat about milk?\n•\nWhole milk may replace breast milk or formula at 1 year\n•\nContinue whole milk until age 2, then may switch to\nlower-fat milk\nWhen is baby ready for solid foods?\n•\nBaby can sit with support\n•\nShows interest in foods others are eating\n•\nCan move food from front to back of mouth\n•\nWeight has doubled since birth\n•\nNurses eight or more times or drinks more than 32\nounces of formula in 24 hours \n•\nNo earlier than 4 to 6 months of age\nWhich foods, what order?\n•\nIron-fortified, single-grain cereals \n•\nVegetables \n•\nFruits\n•\nStrained meats\n•\nSoft, mashed table foods\n•\nFinger foods\nOther tips about solid foods and eating in general\n•\nOffer one new food about every week\n•\nOffer small amounts frequently throughout the day\n•\nAvoid encouraging baby to eat too much or too fast\n•\nInfants generally have an inborn sense to consume an\nadequate amount of calories\n•\nEgg whites are highly allergenic.

As children approach their teen years, boys\nand girls differ distinctly in growth patterns.  Puberty\ngenerally begins about age 10 in girls and age 12 in boys and\nnormally lasts for 2 to 3 years.  During these years, growth\nspurts occur.\nIt is during the school-age years that the guidance of\nparents is especially important to formulating good nutri-\ntion habits.  Modeling healthful eating practices such as\neating foods that are low in fat and high in complex car-\nbohydrates and fiber is important.  Emphasize breakfast\nas an important meal.  Pack healthful lunches that include\nfruit, vegetables, bread or some other form of starch, a\nmeat or other protein, and low-fat milk.  If a child partic-\nipates in the school lunch program, talk about how to make\nnutritious food choices.  Provide fruits, vegetables, whole-\ngrain breads, or low-fat yogurts as after-school snacks.  If\na child participates in vigorous physical activity, more calories\nmay be needed. \nOne of the major challenges for some school-age chil-\ndren is controlling weight.  If a child eats more calories\nthan are used, the pounds will add up, particularly if the\nchild is inactive.  Besides the social and emotional stresses\nthat may result from peers who make fun of a child's excess\nweight, a higher than desirable weight at this age can\nincrease the risk for later health problems, such as diabetes,\nhigh blood pressure, and increased blood cholesterol or\ntriglyceride values.\nStill, overweight children have the same nutrient needs\nas other children.  The goal should be to stop or slow the\nrate of weight gain and allow height (growth) to catch up.\nDo not allow a child to restrict certain foods or to try fad\ndiets.  Instead, provide healthful foods in lesser amounts.\nThe best way to teach a child about good nutrition is\nto set a good example in your own eating habits.\n42\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\n•\nMake it comfortable for a child to eat—comfortably\nseated, foot support, finger foods.\n•\nDevelop a routine—schedule regular meals and\nsnacks.\n•\nPlan one familiar food at each meal.\n•\nOffer various textures and colors—separate them on \nthe plate.\n•\nServe small portions and let the child ask for more.\n•\nAllow a child to eat at his or her own pace.\n•\nTeach and reinforce good table manners.\n•\nRemain calm if a meal is left untouched.\n•\nSet a good example.\nFoods with color and crunch are interesting—and fun—for\nyoungsters.\nTIPS FOR FEEDING TODDLERS\nTeenage Years: Ages 13 to 19\nThe teen years and the arrival of puberty are the second\nperiod of remarkable growth for youngsters.  It is a period\nof profound development that has important nutritional\nimplications.  As a result, requirements increase for energy\nand all nutrients.\nThe growth and energy requirements of the teen years\nnudge daily calorie needs upward.  On average, boys 11\nto 14 years old need to have approximately 2,500 calories\nper day.  From age 15 to 18, daily calorie requirements\nincrease to 2,800 calories.  Teenage girls also require more\ncalories, but in the neighborhood of 2,200 calories a day. \nMost of the calories a teenager consumes should take\nthe form of the complex carbohydrates found at the bottom\nof the Food Guide Pyramid. It is also a good idea for teens\nto have 3 servings of calcium-rich foods a day (milk, yogurt,\ncheese, certain vegetables) to make certain that needs are\nmet for growing bones.  Iron is also important to the expand-\ning volume of blood in the body and for increasing muscle\nmass.  Teenage girls can be at risk for a shortage of iron as\na result of iron loss through menstruation.  To ensure ample\ndietary iron, encourage teens to eat fish, poultry (especially\ndark meat), red meat, eggs, legumes, potatoes, broccoli,\nrice, and iron-enriched grain products.\nGrowing, active teenagers have a real need to snack\nbetween meals.  Encourage healthful snacks such as fresh\nfruits and raw vegetables, low-fat yogurt, low-fat milk,\nwhole-grain bread, popcorn, pretzels, and cereals.\nSeveral factors challenge the ability of teenagers to eat\nwell.  The typical teen has a busy school schedule, extracur-\nricular activities, and often part-time employment.  These\nmay lead to skipping breakfast and other meals in favor of\nmore meals from vending machines and fast-food restau-\nrants, and more snacking on convenience items.  For\nexample, adolescence is an especially important time to\nget adequate calcium.  Inadequate calcium may make teens\nmore prone to the development of osteoporosis and other\ndiseases in the future.  \nWhen weight gain accompanies these habits, many\nteenagers turn to fad diets for quick weight loss.  All of\nthese pressures may lead to nutritional excesses, deficiencies,\nand, at the extreme, eating disorders.  \nExcessive weight concerns can have more serious impli-\ncations.  Extremes in eating patterns, either severe under-\neating or excessive overeating, may result in serious—even\nlife-threatening—health risks.  These extremes may impair\nsome bodily functions, including decreased hormone pro-\nduction, and thereby slow sexual maturation in both girls\nand boys.  Consult a health care professional if an adoles-\ncent has a problem with weight. \nAdulthood \nThe adult body is dynamic, changing subtly as the years\nmarch by.  Therefore, what was a good diet for you in your\nsecond or third decade of life may no longer be a good fit\nat age 50 or 60.\nFor example, your metabolism—the way in which your\nbody converts the food you eat into energy—slows. This\nmeans that you gradually need less food for a similar activity\nlevel.  Fewer and fewer calories are needed as you grow\nolder—about 10 percent less per decade from age 50\nonward.  This slowing of the metabolism is perfectly nat-\nural and occurs because you lose muscle mass (which utilizes\nmost of the energy you produce) as you age.  Exercise helps\nto maintain muscle mass and helps you burn calories.\nHowever, most Americans still need to reduce calories.\nVariety and moderation remain the keys to a healthful\ndiet.  A balanced diet ensures proper intake of vitamins,\nminerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients.\nModeration controls calories and is especially important\nwith regard to consumption of alcohol.  Drinking plenty of\nwater, eating fiber-rich foods, and staying as active as possible\ncan help to stave off constipation.\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding \nThe best time to start thinking about good nutrition is\nbefore a woman becomes pregnant.  Then she can be certain\nthat her baby will have all the essential nutrients from the\nmoment of conception.\nBabies born at low weights (less than 5.5 pounds) have\na greater likelihood for development of health problems.\nMothers-to-be can help prevent this from occurring by\neating the well-rounded diet that women their age would\nideally eat, as well as achieving an appropriate weight for\ntheir height.  Women who are 15 percent or more under-\nweight present a special risk for a difficult pregnancy and\nchildbirth.\nBefore becoming pregnant, talk to your health care\nprovider about your need for a folic acid (a B vitamin)\nsupplement.  Doctors and scientists agree that use of folic\nacid supplements can reduce the occurrence of a birth\ndefect called a neural tube defect.  One form of this defect\nis spina bifida, an incomplete closure of the spine.  Folate\nlevels also may be affected by consuming alcohol and\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n43\n“Morning” sickness\n“Morning” sickness is not necessarily unique to mornings.\nAbout half of all pregnant women experience this during\nthe first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n•\nEat dry toast or crackers.\n•\nEat smaller amounts—more frequently—so that your\nstomach isn't too empty or too full.\n•\nLimit or avoid spicy and fried foods.\n•\nSip liquids.  Try crushed ice or frozen ice pops to avoid\ndehydration if you are vomiting.\n•\nCook in a well-ventilated kitchen.\nHeartburn\nDuring the later part of pregnancy, hormonal changes and\nthe pressure due to an expanding uterus pushing on your\nstomach slow the rate at which food leaves the stomach.\nTo diminish heartburn:\n•\nEat smaller meals more frequently.\n•\nLimit or avoid chocolate and spicy and fried foods.\n•\nLimit caffeine.\nConstipation\nIncreased pressure from the growing baby can slow down\nthe movement of the contents in your bowels.\n•\nDrink plenty of liquids—2 to 3 quarts daily.\n•\nEat whole-grain breads and cereals, fresh fruits, and raw\nvegetables.\n•\nExercise moderately and regularly.\nAnemia\nPregnancy increases the risk for anemia because of an inad-\nequate intake of iron and folate, greater needs for these\nnutrients because of the baby, or both.\n•\nEat iron-rich foods (red meat, eggs, liver, dried fruit,\niron-fortified cereals).\n•\nEat foods with folate (leafy green vegetables, oranges\nand grapefruit, dry beans, and cereals fortified with \nfolic acid).\n•\nFollow your health care provider's recommendations\nabout supplements.\nBreastfeeding\n•\nDrink plenty of liquids—2 to 3 quarts daily.\n•\nChoose calcium-rich foods (milk, yogurt, cheese, pud-\nding, tofu).\n•\nIf you have a limited diet, check with your health care\nprovider about continuing your prenatal vitamin-miner-\nal supplement.\n•\nExercise regularly and moderately.\nToxins\n•\nIf you drink alcohol, stop.  If you don't, don't start.\n•\nIf you smoke, stop.  If you don't, don't start.  \n•\nAvoid excessive salt, which may cause fluid retention\nand increase blood pressure.\nsmoking cigarettes, both of which are toxic to the devel-\noping fetus and should not be used when you are pregnant.\nTaking oral contraceptives is also associated with low levels\nof folate.\nIt is essential to talk with your health care provider about\nfolic acid because too much of any supplement can harm\nyour health.  The best dietary sources of folic acid include\nfortified breakfast cereals and enriched grain products.\nFolate (the natural form of this vitamin found in foods) is\nfound in leafy green vegetables, oranges and grapefruit,\nblack-eyed peas, kidney beans, and other cooked dried beans.\nEven if you eat a well-balanced diet, prenatal vitamins are\nrecommended.\nResearch has proved that women who have a normal\nweight at the time of conception have the healthiest preg-\nnancies and babies if they gain 25 to 35 pounds.  Women\nwho are underweight may need to gain additional weight.\nEven women who are overweight should plan on gaining\nabout 15 to 20 pounds.  During the first trimester, additional\ncalories may not be needed.  It is important, however, to\nmake sure that your diet provides the best nutrition possible\nfor you and your unborn baby.  In the second and third\ntrimesters, you will need about 300 extra calories per day\nbeyond your normal diet.  Concentrate on foods such as\nlean meat, low- or no-fat dairy products, and dark green\nvegetables, all of which provide generous amounts of\n44\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nTIPS FOR PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING WOMEN\nvitamins, minerals, and protein.  If you enjoy milk and\ndairy products, it will be easy to meet your need for calci-\num, a crucial mineral during pregnancy.  If you do not, ask\nyour doctor or registered dietitian about calcium-fortified\nfoods.  In some cases, a supplement may be recommended.\nEven with the increased need for calories, it is nearly\nimpossible to get sufficient amounts of iron, which is\nneeded in double the amounts recommended for non-\npregnant women.  The added iron is needed for the expand-\ned blood volume that accommodates the changes in your\nbody during pregnancy.  Iron is also needed for the\nformation of tissue for both your baby and the placenta.\nAt birth, a newborn needs enough stored iron to last for the\nfirst 6 months of life.  The best advice is to eat a healthful\ndiet and take only the supplements recommended by your\ncaregiver.\nOnce a baby is born, the mother who chooses to breast-\nfeed still needs extra calories—typically about 500 calories\nper day.  Continue to concentrate on eating nutrient-rich\nfoods (see sidebar:  Tips for Pregnant and Breastfeeding\nWomen, page 44).\nSenior Years   \nMaintaining a healthful diet into older adulthood can be\na challenge, particularly if part of what makes eating a\npleasurable experience—the senses of taste and smell—\ndecline.  Tooth loss or mouth pain can further complicate\nthe act of eating.  The medicines that must be taken to\ntreat chronic diseases may affect appetite, when meals are\neaten, and, in some cases, how food tastes.\nOther life changes, including the loss of a spouse, fewer\nsocial contacts, economic hardships, and increasing depen-\ndence on others for day-to-day care, combine to make\ngetting a healthful diet more difficult, but more impor-\ntant than ever.\nAs people become older, they can expect to need fewer\ncalories than they did when they were younger—about 10\npercent less per decade from age 50 onward.  Persons age\n70 should be eating about 80 percent of the calories they\nwere eating 20 years earlier. Nonetheless, older people con-\ntinue to need other nutrients in the same quantities as ever.\nThis decline in calorie intake translates into a need for\nfood that is rich in nutrients, to provide what you used to\nget with more calories when you were younger.   Keeping\na lower-calorie intake in mind, you can simply follow the\nbasics of the Food Guide Pyramid as you get older: heavy\non the grain foods, fruits, and vegetables; adequate meats\nand dairy products; light on the fats, oils, and sweets. \nWatch for signs of poor nutrition in older adults and\nconsult a physician, registered dietitian, or other health\ncare professional to address their nutritional needs and to\ndetermine whether supplementation with vitamins is needed.\nChapter 2:  The Nutrients and Other Food Substances\n45\nDuring pregnancy, choose snacks wisely—with health in mind.\nThis snack includes 1 cup frozen yogurt topped with granola,\nraisins, apples, and cinnamon.  (See Chapter 5, page 132, \nfor recipe.)\nIn this chapter, you will read about the\nimportance of nutrition in maintaining \nor improving your health.  Whether you \nare healthy, have a medical problem, \nhave a family history of one, or know a \nfamily member or friend with an illness,\nnutrition plays a major role in prevention\nand treatment of common diseases.\nK\nnowing what nutrients comprise a well-balanced diet,\nin what foods to find them, and in what quantities to\neat them are some of the first steps to good health.  Applying\nthis knowledge by eating nutrient-rich foods and incor-\nporating physical activity into your schedule at any stage of\nlife are the greatest investments you can make in sustain-\ning good health.\nAlthough healthful eating may lower your risk for certain\ndiseases, there are no guarantees that adhering to the tenets\nof good nutrition will prevent an illness from developing.\nScience has shown that not all diseases or disorders are asso-\nciated with what you eat.  However, statistics do show\nthat lifelong food selections may influence the\nrisk for some diseases. \nResearch continues to evaluate and\nclarify the role that diet and nutri-\ntion play in the promotion of\nhealth and in the development of\nobesity, high blood pressure,\ndiabetes mellitus, coronary artery\ndisease, osteoporosis, cancer, and\nother illnesses.  The nutritional\nrecommendations for prevention\nof many diseases are similar (see\nChapter 1).\nIn this chapter you will learn\nabout selected conditions in which\nnutrition plays an important role\nand how proper nutrition may affect and even alter the\ncourse of these conditions.\nOBESITY\nIf obesity were merely a matter of aesthetics, it would be of\nless concern.  But obesity is a health issue.  It is associated\nwith an increased risk of diabetes, lipid abnormalities,\ncoronary artery disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers\n(such as breast, colon, and gallbladder in women and colon\nand prostate in men), stroke, degenerative arthritis,\nrespiratory problems, sleep disturbances, and\ngallbladder disease.\nObesity places a huge burden on society in\nterms of lost lives, ongoing illnesses, emotional pain,\ndiscrimination, and economic cost (nearly $100\nbillion annually).  The most ominous burdens posed by\nbeing overweight are reduction of the quality of life and\nshortening of life span.  The likeli-\nhood of dying early (compared\nwith the average age at death\nof all people in the population)\nprogressively increases the more\noverweight you are.  Diseases\ncaused by obesity are the second\nleading cause of preventable deaths\nin the United States.\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nr\n \nt\nh\nr\ne\ne\nFOOD-HEALTH\nCONNECTION\nTHE\nThe Battle of the Bulge\nWith countless diet programs and products promising to\nhelp you shed pounds, losing weight should be easy.  Simply\neating too much and not being active enough are the causes\nof most overweight problems.  But you also know it is hard\nto lose weight and even harder to keep it off.  The cause of\noverweight and obesity is a chronic imbalance of calories\ningested and calories burned.  Genetic and environmental\nfactors also contribute to obesity.\nAmericans spend more than $33 billion a year on\nweight-loss products and services, but they are losing the\n“battle of the bulge.”  Despite the great desire of Americans\nto be thinner, they have become more obese.  Some have\neven declared that the United States has an “obesity epi-\ndemic.”  It is estimated that more than 50 percent of adult\nAmericans are overweight.  The prevalence of obesity also\nis increasing in several other countries.\nGet the Terms Straight\n“Overweight” and “obesity” are terms that often are used\ninterchangeably, but they have different meanings.\n“Overweight” refers to having excess body weight com-\npared with the norm for a person’s height, but the term\ndoes not account for what tissue is making up the weight.\nFor example, athletes are often overweight according to\nweight-for-height tables because they have increased muscle\nmass.  However, for most people, overweight means having\ntoo much fat. \n“Obesity” refers to body fat in excess of what is healthful\nfor an individual.  In healthy women, an acceptable level\nof body fat ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  In contrast, an\nacceptable range of body fat in men is from 10 to 23 percent.\nHow Your Body Uses Food\nThe number of calories used by an individual is deter-\nmined by three factors:  basal metabolic rate, the thermic\neffect of the food eaten, and the calories used during phys-\nical activity.  The basal metabolic rate is the amount of\nenergy needed to maintain bodily functions when an indi-\nvidual is at rest.  This component accounts for 60 to 75 per-\ncent of the daily calorie requirement in sedentary adults.\nThe major determinant of the basal metabolic rate is the\namount of fat-free mass in the body.  Muscle is one example\nof fat-free mass.  Resistance (strength) training can increase\nthe amount of muscle and therefore increase the basal meta-\nbolic rate.  Resistance training also can help prevent the\nloss of lean mass that normally occurs with aging.  Men\ntend to have more muscle than women and therefore burn\nmore calories.\nThe thermic effect of food is the energy required to\ndigest, metabolize, and store nutrients.  The thermic effect\nof food accounts for about 10 percent of the total daily\ncalorie use.  The number of calories burned during exercise\ncan vary tremendously depending on the amount of exercise\nperformed.  For most so-called sedentary persons, the activi-\nties of daily living (such as walking, talking, and sitting)\naccount for 15 to 20 percent of the daily calorie use.\nShould You Lose Weight?\nHow do you determine whether you are overweight or\nobese?  Scientists can use sophisticated tests to measure\nbody composition.  However, these are not necessary for\nmost individuals.  You can measure your change in weight\nover time.  Alternatively, you can calculate your body mass\nindex (BMI) and determine its relationship to health risks.\nPinpointing Your Risk\nThere are risk factors that indicate a predisposition for\nobesity.  Among these risk factors are the following:\nBody mass index (BMI)—BMI is defined as your weight\n(in kilograms) divided by the square of your height (in\nmeters).  Simpler still, look it up in the Body Mass Index\nTable on page 49.  The advantage of BMI over bathroom\nscales and weight-for-height tables is that it normalizes\nweight for height and helps determine whether you have a\nhealthful or unhealthful percentage of total body fat. \nPeople who should not use the BMI for determining\nhealth risks include competitive athletes and body builders.\nTheir BMI will be high because they have a larger amount\nof muscle.  BMI is also not predictive of health risks for\ngrowing children, women who are pregnant or lactating, and\nfrail, sedentary older adults. \nA BMI from 19 to 24.9 is associated with a minimal to\nlow health risk.  A BMI from 25 to 29.9 is considered over-\nweight and is associated with moderate health risks.  A\nBMI of 30 or higher is considered obese and is associated\nwith a substantially greater risk for development of various\ndiseases.  Extreme obesity is a BMI of more than 40. \nBody shape—Increasing attention has been focused\non the distribution of body fat as a potential indicator of\nhealth risk.  Specifically, excess fat in the abdomen is asso-\nciated with an increased risk for development of various\nmetabolic illnesses, including diabetes mellitus, increased\nblood lipid levels, and high blood pressure.  In contrast,\n48\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n49\nBODY MASS INDEX TABLE*\nTo use the table, find your height in the left-hand column.

Upper-body obesity also is associated\nwith an increased risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and\ncertain cancers.\nTherefore, it can be helpful to assess your health risk by\nmeasuring your waist circumference.  A measurement of\nmore than 35 inches in women and 40 inches in men is\nassociated with increased health risks, especially if you have\na BMI of 25 or more.\nWhat Is There to Lose?  To Gain?\nAlthough no one is without health risk—even the fittest\nperson can have a heart attack, diabetes, or cancer—health\nand well-being are apt to be in less jeopardy if BMI, body\nshape, and family health history do not indicate problems.\nHowever, if your BMI is 25 or more, if your fat is primarily\nlocated in your upper body, and if you have a  personal or\nfamily history of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure,\nor sleep apnea, losing weight can greatly improve your health.\nKeep in mind that BMI and waist circumference are\njust starting points. Other factors also are important.  When\nin doubt, seek a medical evaluation by your physician.  A\nthorough history, examination, and blood studies can clarify\nwhether your weight is having adverse effects on your health.\nThe appropriate plan of action then can be tailored to meet\nyour individual needs.\n50\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nMeasuring your waist circumference can be helpful to determine\nhow your body distributes fat.  Fat in your abdomen increases\nyour risk for high blood pressure, coronary artery disease,\ndiabetes, stroke, and certain cancers.\nThe body has a nearly unlimited\ncapacity to store fat.  Excess fat in the\nabdomen can lead to illnesses, includ-\ning diabetes, high blood lipid levels,\nand high blood pressure.  It is also\nassociated with an increased risk for\ncoronary artery disease, stroke, and\ncertain cancers.  Losing weight will\nreduce these risks and lessen the strain\non the lower back, hips, and knees.\nGetting Started\nLosing body fat and keeping it off are not easy.  Losing\nweight and then maintaining a healthful weight require\ncollaboration with knowledgeable health care professionals.\nObesity is not only a medical issue but also is a lifestyle\nissue.  Your habits can help you maintain a desirable body\nweight or they can hamper your efforts to lose weight or\neven cause you to gain further weight. The types and\namounts of food you eat and the exercise you perform will\ndetermine whether you gain, lose, or maintain your weight.\nTherefore, experts recommend that any weight loss program\nshould consist of three main components:  nutrition, exercise\n(or activity), and behavior modification.  (See sidebars:\nWeight Management Programs:  Look for These Criteria,\nand Special Situations, this page.)\nNutrition\nLiquid meals, over-the-counter diet pills, and special combi-\nnations of foods promising to “burn” fat are not the answers\nto long-term weight control and better health.  Learning to\neat differently—to enjoy a well-balanced diet of fewer calories—\nis the best strategy to achieve health and weight goals.  You\nshould begin by substituting the words “healthful nutrition\nprogram” for “diet.”\nMost people try to lose weight by eating 1,000 to 1,500\ncalories a day.  In many instances, eating fewer than 1,400\ncalories makes it difficult to eat a balanced diet containing\nthe recommended levels of nutrients.  Therefore, nutrition\nprograms that are too low in calories may be hazardous to\nyour health.\nYou can lose weight by eating fewer calories or by\nincreasing exercise.  A caloric deficit of 3,500 calories is\nrequired to lose 1 pound of fat.  Over 7 days, this can be\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n51\nWEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS:\nLOOK FOR THESE CRITERIA\nNearly 8 million Americans enroll in some kind \nof structured weight-loss program each year.  Choose a safe\nand helpful program that meets these criteria.\n• Physician participation—Consult a doctor if you have\na health problem or it is necessary to lose more than \n15 to 20 pounds.\n• Qualified staff—Registered dietitians can design a\nnutrition plan.  Specialists in behavior modification\nand exercise are also recommended.\n• Nutritionally balanced diet—Any weight management\nplan should ensure adequate nutrition.  \n• Exercise—At a minimum, there should be instructions\nfor starting a safe exercise program.\n• Reasonable weight loss goals—Weight loss should be\nslow and steady.  A 1- to 2-pound weight loss per week\nis a good start.  A loss of 10 percent of starting weight\nis also a reasonable initial goal.\n• Help in changing lifestyle—Programs should help\nimprove life-long eating and exercise habits.  There\nshould be opportunity for follow-up support—even\nafter goals are reached.\n• The only way to lose weight and keep weight off is to\ncombine a healthful nutrition program (“diet”) with\nregular physical activity.  Prescription medications for\nweight loss may be considered in moderately overweight\nor obese people with weight-related health problems.\nUse of these medications does not eliminate the need for\nhealthful nutrition and activity or behavior modification\nstrategies.  Medical supervision is essential because there\nare potential risks, in addition to benefits.\n• Weight-loss surgery may be considered only in clinically\nsevere obesity (BMI of more than 35) with weight-related\nmedical problems or in extreme obesity (BMI more than 40).\n• Over-the-counter diet products are a huge financial success.\nMany of them promise to help you lose weight by\nincreasing your metabolism or decreasing your \nappetite.  However, these effects can \nbe dangerous, and any weight \nloss isalmost always temporary.\nachieved by cutting 500 calories each day from your usual\nfood intake or by cutting 250 calories each day (such as\none or two fewer cookies) and burning an additional 250\ncalories with exercise (such as by walking briskly for 30\nSPECIAL SITUATIONS\nminutes).  The good news is that a relatively small loss of\nweight can make a big difference in reducing the risk of\nhealth complications from obesity.  Even a 10 percent\nweight loss can lead to improvement in your blood sugar\nlevel, lipid values, and blood pressure.  Once this degree of\nweight loss has been achieved, further weight loss goals\ncan then be set, if needed.  Rather than aiming for an\n“ideal” weight, which may not be achievable or desirable,\nfocus on achieving and maintaining a healthful weight.  \nA healthful diet for controlling weight includes foods\nfrom all food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid—ensuring\nbalance and variety—in sensible amounts (see Chapter 1,\nFood Guide Pyramid, page 11.  Also see Chapters 4 and 5\nfor planning and preparing healthful meals).  It is helpful\nto review the energy density of the food consumed.  Fat con-\ntains 9 calories/gram, protein 4 calories/gram, and carbo-\nhydrates 4 calories/gram.  Alcohol contributes 7 calories/gram.\nFor most people, the volume of food consumed deter-\nmines how full you feel.  Therefore, eating a small amount\nof an energy-dense food (such as fat) is usually not filling,\nwhereas eating a large enough amount to fill you up results\nin a very large calorie intake.  To lose weight, decrease your\ntotal calories by cutting back on the fat while filling up on\nlow-calorie high-nutrient foods such as vegetables, fruits,\nand grains.  You also can eat lower-fat versions of foods.\nHowever, be careful, because low-fat is not always low-\ncalorie (see sidebar:  Low-Fat Is Not Necessarily Low-Calorie,\nthis page).\nHealthful eating habits also avoid the feast or famine\nphenomenon.  Distributing food selections throughout\nthe day provides nourishment to support daily activities\nand can help to eliminate energy highs and lows.  Three\nmeals and occasional snacks also keep one’s appetite in\ncheck.\nIt is also important to avoid the hazards of repeatedly\nlosing and gaining weight.  Although repeated dieting is still\na matter of debate, some studies suggest that it may lower\nthe rate at which calories are burned.  When a person is off\nthe diet and more food is eaten, the body stores fat faster\nand more efficiently.  This effect causes regain of the lost\nweight.  In this circumstance, the amount of weight regained\noften is more than that lost in the first place.\nPhysical Activity\nImproved eating habits in combination with decreased\ncalorie intake and calorie-burning exercise is the best way\nto lose weight and maintain the results.  In addition to\nenhancing weight loss efforts, physical activity promotes loss\nof body fat, increases muscle mass, and increases cardio-\nvascular fitness.  Regular exercise not only helps you lose\nweight by increasing the number of calories you burn but\nalso makes it easier to keep off the weight that you have\nalready lost. \nWalking is a good choice for getting started on an\nexercise plan.  A daily 2-mile walk burns approximately\n1,000 to 1,200 calories per week.  In addition, do not dis-\ncount the physical activity that is part of ordinary activities\nof daily living—housework, climbing stairs, gardening—\nall important forms of exercise that can contribute to weight\nloss.  It may be easier to maintain a schedule if you exercise\nwith a friend.\n52\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nFOOD (AMOUNT)\nCALORIES\nFAT (GRAMS)\nCookie (1 cookie)\nChocolate chip \nRegular\n80\n4.5\nReduced-fat\n70\n3\nSandwich-type\nRegular\n50\n2\nReduced-fat\n55\n1.5\nCrackers\nSoda (5 crackers)\nRegular\n60\n2\nFat-free\n50\n0\nWheat (15 crackers)\nRegular\n130\n6\nFat-free\n180\n0\nIce cream (1/2 cup)\nRegular\n135\n7\nLow-fat\n120\n2\nPotato chips\n(1 ounce or 1 individual bag)\nRegular\n150\n10\nReduced-fat\n135\n6\nPretzels\n(1 ounce or 1 individual bag)\nRegular\n110\n1\nFat-free\n110\n0\nLOW-FAT IS NOT NECESSARILY LOW-CALORIE\nMany experts recommend that you also participate in\nresistance (or strength) training.  Resistance training can\nincrease your muscle mass (which, as discussed previously,\nincreases your basal metabolic rate), your bone density\n(which can help protect against osteoporosis), and your\nbalance and coordination (which can lower the risk of\ninjury), and it can help improve your posture.\nPeople who are overweight, have been inactive, or have\nmedical problems should check with their physician before\nstarting an exercise program.  An exercise stress test may be\nhelpful because it can measure the response of the heart\nto exercise and help establish a safe starting level.  (See\nChapter 1, pages 8 to 10, for further discussion about the\nbenefits of exercise.)\nBehavior Modification\nBehavior modification programs help identify triggers and\ntreatments for unhealthful eating habits—such as uncon-\ntrolled snacking or late night eating.  Such programs often\nexplore the reasons behind an inactive lifestyle.  Food diaries\nand activity logs frequently are used to heighten your aware-\nness of what and how much is eaten and the type and\namount of exercise done daily.  These journals often provide\ninsight into what triggers undesirable eating and what can\nbe done to avoid or change this behavior. \nOther key behavioral elements needed for success include:\nCommitment—There must be personal motivation to\nchange—to eat healthfully and to get regular physical\nactivity.\nPriorities—It takes significant mental and physical\nenergy to change deeply ingrained habits.  If other major\nissues or life stresses are present, it is important to seek help\nfor dealing with them.  When balance in life is regained, you\ncan focus on healthful nutrition more effectively.\nRealistic goals—The best goals are those that can be\nachieved.  Set daily or weekly goals that allow progress to be\nmeasured and rewarded.  Aim to lose about 1 to 2 pounds\nweekly.  It is important to know that small losses of weight—\nor improvements in physical activity—can improve health.\nMeasurements of blood pressure, blood sugar level, and\nblood cholesterol and triglyceride values are more impor-\ntant in terms of health than the number on the scale.  Accept\nthe fact that there will be setbacks.  Instead of becoming\nfrustrated or angry, resume your health program once again.\nGroup support—Joining with people facing the same\nchallenges can promote sharing of ideas and facilitate\ncommitment.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common\nmajor health condition in the United States.  It is one of the\nleading causes of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney\nfailure, and premature death.  It also can damage parts of\nthe circulatory system—including blood vessels in the\nheart, brain, eyes, and kidneys. \nSometimes called the “silent killer,” high blood pressure\nis a disease that can go undetected for years.  The higher the\nblood pressure or the longer it goes undiagnosed, the worse\nthe outlook.  More than 50 million Americans have high\nblood pressure.  Of that number, an estimated one-third do\nnot know they have the disease.\nThere has been remarkable progress in detecting, treating,\nand controlling high blood pressure.  Recently, there has\nbeen a substantial increase in the number of individuals\nwho are aware of their high blood pressure and who are\nbeing treated for it.  At the same time, the incidences of\ncoronary artery disease and stroke have significantly\ndecreased, partially as a result of progress in the detection,\ntreatment, and control of high blood pressure.  Despite\nthese efforts, most people with high blood pressure do not\nhave adequately controlled blood pressure.  Unfortunately,\nhigh blood pressure remains a serious medical problem.\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n53\nPhysical activity enhances weight loss efforts by promoting loss of body\nfat, increasing muscle mass, and increasing cardiovascular fitness.\nApproximately 5 percent of cases of high blood pressure\ncan be traced to underlying diseases, such as kidney disorders\nor conditions that cause narrowing of the arteries.  This is\ncalled “secondary hypertension.”  But most cases have no\nknown cause.  This type is called “primary” or “essential”\nhypertension.\nRisk Factors for High Blood Pressure\nThere are risk factors that indicate a predisposition for the\ndevelopment of high blood pressure.  Among these risk\nfactors are the following:\nFamily history—A family history of high blood pressure\nis a risk for hypertension.\nAge—High blood pressure becomes more common\namong all people as they grow older. After all, nearly two-\nthirds of Americans aged 70 or older have the disease.\nSex—Although men and women are typically equally\naffected, women who use birth control pills and smoke\ncigarettes have a greater chance of having high blood pressure.\nRace—As an example, high blood pressure is more\ncommon among blacks than whites. \nYou either have or don’t have the above risk factors.\nThere are also other factors that increase your risk for high\nblood pressure which you can do something about:\n• obesity—control your weight\n• lack of exercise—get moving\n• alcohol consumption—take control or abstain\n• excessive salt (sodium) intake—cut down\nMeasuring Blood Pressure\nBlood pressure is the force that the blood exerts on the\nartery walls as the heart pumps it through the body.  The\namount of force depends on various factors, including how\nhard the heart pumps and the volume of blood it pumps.\nAnother factor is the amount of resistance blood encoun-\nters in the arteries—the thicker or more clogged the blood\nvessels, the greater the resistance.  The elasticity of arteries\nalso plays a role in blood pressure.  The less elastic arteries\nare, the less they expand under the force of a heartbeat and\nthe higher the resistance.  \nThe standard way to measure blood pressure is in mil-\nlimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  This unit of measurement\nrefers to how high the pressure inside the arteries is able to\nraise a column of mercury.  Each blood pressure measure-\nment has two numbers.  The top number is the systolic\nblood pressure, or the highest pressure within the arteries\nthat occurs during “systole,” when the heart is contracting.\nThe bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure, or the\nlowest pressure within the arteries that occurs during\n“diastole,” when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood.\nFor most people, a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg or\nlower is considered healthy.\nEffects of High Blood Pressure\nRepeated blood pressure measurements that are more than\n130/85 mm Hg indicate a potential for problems, a greater\nrisk of progressing to definite high blood pressure, and the\nneed to have regular blood pressure checks.  A measurement\nof 140 systolic or more, 90 diastolic or more, or both indi-\ncates high blood pressure, which requires treatment.  Recent\nguidelines stress the importance of treating to achieve a\npressure less than 130/85.  Indeed, treating to these lower\nlevels of blood pressure further reduces the incidence of\nstroke, heart and kidney damage, and other vascular prob-\nlems.\nWhen high blood pressure occurs, it means that the\nforce of the blood in the arteries is excessive and many\nhealth complications can occur (see illustration on page\n55).\nHeart\nHigh blood pressure forces the heart to work harder than\nit should to pump blood to distant tissues and organs.\nAnother way to understand blood pressure is to think of it\nas a weight or a load that the heart muscle must “push” against.\nLike any muscle, the heart gets larger with pushing heavy\n54\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nSYSTOLIC (MM HG)\nDIASTOLIC (MM HG)\nOptimal*\n120 or less\nand\n80 or less\nNormal\n129 or less\nand\n84 or less\nHigh-normal\n130-139\nor\n85-89\nHypertension\nStage 1†\n140-159\nor\n90-99\nStage 2†\n160-179\nor\n100-109\nStage 3†\n180 or higher or\n110 or higher\n*Optimal pressure with respect to cardiovascular risk.\n†Based on the average of two or more readings taken at each \nof two or more visits after an initial screening.\nCLASSIFICATION OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nLose weight—If you are overweight, losing weight is the\nmost effective non-drug method for lowering blood\npressure.  A weight loss of as little as 10 pounds can sig-\nnificantly reduce blood pressure in many overweight people\nwith high blood pressure.  In some people, weight loss\nalone is sufficient to avoid the need for blood pressure\nmedication.\nExercise—When compared with more active and fit\npeers, sedentary individuals with normal blood pressure\nhave a 20 to 50 percent increased risk for development of\nhigh blood pressure. Regular aerobic exercise such as walking\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n55\nHigh blood pressure can damage vital organs and result in many\nlife-threatening medical problems.\nBleeding within\nbrain (stroke)\nBleeding within\neye (hemorrhage)\nEnlarged (hyper-\ntrophied) heart\nShrunken\n(ischemic)\nkidney\nPartially\nobstructed\nartery (ath-\nerosclerosis)\nEnlarged\nartery\n(aneurysm)\nweights.  Eventually, the heart’s pumping efficiency decreas-\nes when the muscle can no longer adapt to the excessive\nworkload that the high blood pressure demands.  When\nthis occurs, the heart muscle may weaken and the heart\ncan fail. \nArteries\nHigh blood pressure can also accelerate the development of\nplaque within the arteries, a condition known as athero-\nsclerosis.  With the narrowing of the artery walls, the risk\nof heart attack is increased.  High blood pressure also can\nlead to bulges (aneurysms) in the arteries.  If an aneurysm\nin a major artery ruptures, the results can be catastrophic\nand possibly fatal.\nBrain\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of having a stroke,\nwhich occurs when a blood vessel within the brain either\nruptures or is blocked.\nKidneys\nThe kidneys filter waste products from the blood and main-\ntain proper blood minerals and blood volume.  When these\nfunctions are impaired or compromised, so is their role in\nhelping to maintain blood pressure.  These effects can produce\na destructive cycle that results in increasing blood pressure\nand a gradual failure of the kidneys to remove impurities\nfrom the blood.\nEyes\nHigh blood pressure often causes problems with the eyes.\nExamination of the retina can reveal narrowing of the\narteries, small hemorrhages, and accumulations of protein\nthat have leaked from affected blood vessels (exudates).\nAlthough it is unusual for high blood pressure to impair\nvision, it can occur as a result of severe constriction of the\nretinal arteries and swelling (edema) of the retina during\nepisodes of increased blood pressure.  Treating the high\nblood pressure is the only way to reverse this vision loss.\nTreating High Blood Pressure\nFortunately for many people, high blood pressure is\npreventable.  Even those who already have high blood\npressure or are at increased risk may be able to reduce the\nnumber and doses of medications needed to control it and\nminimize other health complications by the following\nlifestyle modifications.\nor biking for 30 to 45 minutes most days of the week is a\nvery effective means of lowering blood pressure. \nLimit alcohol—Excessive alcohol intake is a risk factor\nfor high blood pressure and stroke.  It also can interfere\nwith the effects of blood pressure medications.  Men who\ndrink should limit their intake to no more than 2 drinks a\nday; women should have no more than 1 drink daily (see\nChapter 4, A Drink Defined, page 87).  \nDo not smoke—Smoking a cigarette temporarily\nincreases blood pressure for up to 30 minutes.  Smoking is\nalso a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  Everyone,\nespecially people with high blood pressure, needs to quit\nsmoking or never start.  \nLimit or avoid high-sodium foods—A high intake of\nsodium in the diet increases blood pressure in some people.\nThe average American consumes about 4,000 milligrams\nor more of sodium a day.  People with high blood pressure\nshould limit their sodium intake to less than 2,400 mil-\nligrams a day, and many experts recommend the same limit\nfor everyone. \n56\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nSIGNIFICANT NUTRIENTS\nFOOD GROUP\nDAILY SERVINGS\nSERVING SIZES\nIN EACH FOOD GROUP\nGrains and grain products\n7-8\n1 slice bread\nEnergy and fiber\n(emphasis on whole grains)\n1/2 cup dry cereal\n1/2 cup cooked rice, \npasta, or cereal\nVegetables\n4-5\n1 cup leafy vegetable\nPotassium, magnesium, and fiber\n1/2 cup cooked vegetable\n6 ounces vegetable juice\nFruits\n4-5\n1 medium fruit\nPotassium, magnesium, and fiber\n1/2 cup fresh, frozen, \nor canned fruit\n1/4 cup dried fruit\n6 ounces 100% juice\nLow-fat or nonfat \n2-3\n8 ounces milk\nCalcium and protein\ndairy products\n1 cup yogurt\n1.5 ounces cheese\nLean meats, poultry, fish\n2 or less\n3 ounces cooked meats, \nProtein and magnesium\npoultry, or fish\nNuts, seeds, and legumes\n4-5 per week\n1.5 ounces (1/3 cup) nuts\nMagnesium, potassium, protein, and \n2 tablespoons (1/2 ounce)\nfiber; high in calories\nseeds\n1/2 cup cooked legumes\nNote:  This plan provides approximately 2,000 calories.  The number of daily servings from a food group should vary \nwith individual needs.\nTHE COMBINATION DIET FROM THE DASH STUDY\nThis eating plan is from the \"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\" (DASH) study from the \nNational Institutes of Health.  This diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy foods and low in \nsaturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol.  It is also high in potassium, calcium, and magnesium.  \nFollow a balanced nutrition program—A low-fat, high-\nfruit and vegetable diet can lower blood pressure impres-\nsively, all by itself.  A large percentage of people with high\nblood pressure may be able to decrease their need for blood\npressure medication if they follow the recommendations of\nthe Food Guide Pyramid.  A diet following this plan promotes\nweight loss and is high in minerals such as calcium, potassi-\num, and magnesium, which have been associated with lower\nblood pressure.  Chapters 4 and 5 (pages 79 through 149)\nprovide ideas for planning and preparing healthful meals.\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recently\nsponsored a study testing the effects of different diets on\nblood pressure, called the “DASH” (Dietary Approaches to\nStop Hypertension) study.  Participants in the study ate\none of three diets:  an average American diet, a diet rich in\nfruits and vegetables, or a “combination” diet that empha-\nsized fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and was\nlow in fat and saturated fat.  Sodium consumption was the\nsame in all three diets.  Participants were asked to limit\nobviously salty food, to rinse canned vegetables, and to\nnot add extra salt to food. \nBoth the fruit-and-vegetable diet and the “combina-\ntion” diet lowered blood pressure.  However, the combi-\nnation diet was the most effective.  Within that group,\npeople with above-normal blood pressure (more than\n129/80 mm Hg) and those with high blood pressure (more\nthan 140/90 mm Hg) experienced reductions of their blood\npressure similar to those achieved with some blood pressure\nmedications.\nResearchers believe that people following the combi-\nnation diet fared better because of the low saturated fat\nand high fruit and vegetable mixture that provided adequate\npotassium, magnesium, and calcium.  For people with normal\nblood pressure, the combination diet may help to avoid\nblood pressure problems. If blood pressure is only slightly\nincreased, following this diet may actually eliminate the\nneed for medication.  For people with severe high blood\npressure, the diet may allow reduction in blood pressure\nmedication (see sidebar: The Combination Diet From the\nDASH Study, page 56).\nWhen Medications Are Needed\nWhen lifestyle changes alone are not effective for lower-\ning high blood pressure, medications may be required.\nMedications vary in the way they control blood pressure.\nSome types help the kidneys to eliminate sodium and water,\nsome make the heart beat more slowly and less forcefully,\nand others enable the blood vessels to relax and decrease the\nresistance to blood flow.  Your physician will determine\nwhich drug or combination of drugs is best suited for you.\nDIABETES MELLITUS\nEach year, the words “you have diabetes” are spoken with\ngreater frequency, often to unsuspecting individuals.  Among\nAmericans, the prevalence of diabetes has grown dramatically\nduring the 20th century.  Today, more than 16 million\nAmericans have diabetes—90 percent of them are older\nthan 40 years.  Interestingly, half of these adults do not even\nknow they have the disease because symptoms develop\ngradually and, at first, are hard to identify.  Early diagnosis\nis important, though, because the longer diabetes goes\nuntreated, the greater your risk for serious complications.\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder of metabolism—the way\nthe body uses digested food for energy and growth.  The\norigin of the name “diabetes mellitus” is Greek, referring to\nsweetness or honey (mellitus) that passes through (diabetes).\nAfter a meal, food is broken down into simpler forms and\nabsorbed by the body.  Simple sugars, amino acids, and\nfatty acids are used by the body or converted by the liver into\nsugar (glucose), the preferred fuel the body burns for energy.\nFor cells to use this form of sugar, insulin—a hormone\nthat is produced by the pancreas—must “unlock” the cells\nto allow glucose to enter.  \nThe pancreas, a long, thin organ that is about the size\nof a hand, is located  behind the stomach.  Normally the\npancreas produces the right amount of insulin to accom-\nmodate the amount of sugar that is in the blood.  Diabetes\nis actually not a single condition but a group of diseases\nwith one thing in common—a problem with insulin.  In\na person with diabetes, the pancreas does not produce\nsufficient insulin to meet the body’s needs.  This insuffi-\nciency may develop if the pancreas stops producing the\nright amount and quality of insulin, if the rest of the body’s\ncells do not respond properly to insulin, or a combination\nof both.  Insulin is required for glucose to be metabolized\nproperly.  If there is not enough insulin, excess glucose\nbuilds up in the blood, and the resulting condition is called\nhyperglycemia. \nPersistent hyperglycemia causes almost all the symptoms\nthat may alert an individual to the development of diabetes.\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n57\nThese symptoms can include frequent urination, extreme\nthirst, blurred vision, fatigue, unexplained weight loss,\nrecurrent infection, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands\nor feet, and hunger. \nWith diabetes, the excess glucose spills into the urine,\nand the urine output increases.  Consequently, the person\nwith diabetes becomes dehydrated and thirsty.  Fatigue\nresults when the supply of glucose to cells is not available,\ncausing energy levels to decline.  To compensate for the\nlost fuel, the body burns stored fat, and weight loss and\nhunger may occur.  Left untreated, persistent hyperglycemia\nis also responsible for most of the long-term complications\nof diabetes (see Long-Term Complications of Diabetes,\nthis page).\nThere are several types of diabetes—different disorders\nwith different causes.  The two most common types are\ndescribed here.\nType 1 Diabetes\nType 1 diabetes occurs in 1 in 10 people with diabetes.  In\nthese individuals, the pancreas produces little or no insulin.\nTo control blood sugar, insulin must be taken.  Most people\nwhose diabetes is diagnosed before age 30 have the insulin-\ndependent type.  It used to be called insulin-dependent\ndiabetes mellitus or juvenile-onset diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes\naffects both sexes equally.  In most cases it is due to an\nautoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system\nattacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the\npancreas.  This type of diabetes commonly develops in child-\nhood, but it can occur at any age.  It can develop unnoticed\nfor several years and then suddenly become apparent, often\nafter an illness.  Some people—particularly children and\nteenagers—may first become aware of the disease when\nthey develop ketoacidosis.  This is a serious complication\nin which the blood becomes more acidic because of severe\ninsulin deficiency.  \nType 2 Diabetes\nType 2 diabetes accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of\ndiabetes in people older than 30.  It was previously  called\nnon-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes.  Most\npersons with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\nFor people with this type of diabetes, total absence of\ninsulin is not the problem.  The problem is that the body does\nnot make enough insulin to meet its needs and the insulin\ndoes not work normally to control glucose levels.  This is\ntermed “insulin resistance” and leads to hyperglycemia.\nExcess weight is by far the greatest risk factor for devel-\nopment of type 2 diabetes.  Most people who develop type\n2 diabetes are overweight, a condition that appears to impair\ninsulin action.  Someone who is overweight and has diabetes\nmay be able to achieve a normal blood sugar without\nmedication simply by losing weight.  Losing as little as 10\npercent of body weight has been shown to lower blood\nglucose.  Surprisingly, persons who are not overweight by\ntraditional criteria also may be at risk for diabetes.  Excess\nbody fat distributed mostly in the abdomen increases the\nchance for development of type 2 diabetes.  Other risk\nfactors include age, race, heredity, and lack of physical\nactivity.  \nType 2 diabetes may go undetected for many years,\nbecause hyperglycemia develops slowly and the disease may\nnot immediately produce the classic symptoms of diabetes.\nUnfortunately, even without symptoms, there are hidden\ndangers, including damage to major organs such as the\nheart and kidneys.  Because the disease usually develops\nafter age 40, and the incidence increases more steeply after\nage 55, it is important that people in middle age be screened\nfor the disease and see their physician if symptoms develop.  \nType 2 diabetes is more common among Native\nAmericans, Hispanics, African-Americans, and western-\nized Asians than among people of European ancestry.\nLong-Term Complications of Diabetes \nNumerous studies have shown that keeping the blood\nglucose level close to normal delays the onset and prevents\nthe progression of eye, kidney, and nerve diseases caused by\ndiabetes.  Even if blood glucose has not been controlled\nin the past, any improvement in diabetes control may help\nto avoid or delay complications of diabetes and their\nprogression. Treatment of high blood lipid values and high\nblood pressure, which are commonly associated with\ndiabetes, is also important.\nEye disease—In the absence of good glucose control, eye\ndisease develops in nearly everyone with diabetes.  Diabetic\nretinopathy occurs because high blood sugar (especially\ncoupled with high blood pressure) can damage the small\nblood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive area within the\neye). Diabetes also can lead to cataracts, damage the macula\n(the area in the eye where the optic nerve is located), and\nincrease the risk of glaucoma. \nIn addition to keeping your glucose levels under control,\nit is important to have regular eye examinations with an\nophthalmologist, who dilates the eyes and does a thorough\n58\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nexamination of them. A non-dilated eye test is not adequate\nfor screening.\nKidney failure—In the absence of good glucose control,\na person with diabetes is 20 times more likely to develop\nkidney failure than someone who does not have the disease.\nKidney disease results when chronic high blood sugar damages\nthe small vessels in the kidneys which are responsible for\nfiltering waste from the blood.  Ultimately, kidney failure\nmay occur, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. People\nwith diabetes should have the function of their kidneys\nevaluated routinely.\nNerve damage—Also called neuropathy, nerve damage\noccurs in 30 to 40 percent of people with diabetes.  Nerve\ndamage can cause numbness and tingling, pain, insensitivity\nto pain and temperature, and extreme sensitivity to touch.\nExperts think the damage results from the effect of chronic\nhigh blood sugar on blood vessels that supply nerve cells.\nThe feet are especially vulnerable to neuropathy.\nCardiovascular disease—Chronic high blood sugar is\nassociated with narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis),\nhigh blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.  It is also\nassociated with increased blood levels of triglycerides (a\ntype of blood fat) and decreased levels of  HDL (“good”)\ncholesterol.  Unless appropriately treated, an individual\nwith diabetes is 5 times more likely to have a stroke and 2\nto 4 times more likely to have coronary artery disease. Also,\nsmoking dramatically accelerates the development of these\ncardiovascular complications. Anyone with diabetes should\nstop smoking.\nInfections—High blood sugar impairs the function of\nimmune cells and increases the risk of infections.  The\nmouth, gums, lungs, skin, feet, bladder, and genital area are\ncommon sites of infection.  Nerve damage in the legs and\nfeet can make someone with diabetes less aware of injuries\nor infection, increasing the risk of amputation.  With prop-\ner care of the feet, foot complications can be minimized\nor avoided.\nCan Diabetes Be Prevented?\nAlthough an area of active research, there is currently no\nproven means of preventing type 1 diabetes.  However,\nthese lifestyle changes minimize the risk of, and may actually\nprevent, type 2 diabetes:\nMaintain a healthful weight—Most people who develop\ntype 2 diabetes are overweight.  Aggressive efforts aimed at\nachieving and maintaining a healthful weight may be bene-\nficial, especially in combination with exercise.  \nEat a balanced diet—A diet low in saturated fat and\nsugar and high in complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber\nalso has been linked to a reduced risk of diabetes.\nExercise—People who exercise regularly have a signif-\nicantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes.\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n59\nBlood sugar can be kept within normal \nlevels by balancing the main treatment \ntools for diabetes—nutrition, weight control, \nexercise, and medication.  In some people, blood \nsugar may be controlled by a combination of loss \nof excess weight, good nutrition, and regular exercise.  \nOthers may need medication.\nHow Is Diabetes Diagnosed?\nIt is important that diabetes be diagnosed early, before too\nmuch damage is done.  As a first step, the American\nDiabetes Association recommends that everyone should\nvisit a physician and get a fasting blood glucose test at age\n45.  A sample of blood is drawn after fasting overnight,\nand its glucose level is measured.  A normal fasting result\nis between 70 and 110 milligrams of glucose per deciliter\nof blood (mg/dL).\nA retest every 3 years is advised.  If an individual has\nany risk factors for diabetes or any symptoms, testing at\nmore frequent intervals or at an earlier age is recommended.\nDiabetes is diagnosed when a fasting blood glucose value\nis more than 125 mg/dL or a glucose value is more than 200\nmg/dL accompanied by symptoms of diabetes.  The diagnosis\nshould be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day.\nTools for Controlling Diabetes\nPersons with diabetes can live a full life by following a few\nbasic principles to control their disease.  Diabetes can be\nmanaged with at-home blood glucose tests, healthy nutrition\nhabits, weight control, routine exercise, and medications (if\nneeded).\nThe most important step is to learn to control the blood\nsugar value, which means maintaining it as near to normal\nas possible or in the goal range determined by your physician.\nVigilant control of blood sugar levels may dramatically\nreduce the risk of eye, kidney, and nerve damage.  This\nalso lowers the risk of heart attack, stroke, and\nlimb amputation, in addition to pro\nmoting a more desirable level of\nblood lipids. \nBlood sugar can be kept \nwithin normal levels by \nbalancing the main treat\nment tools for diabetes—\nnutrition, weight control, \nexercise, and medication.  In \nsome people, blood sugar may \nbe controlled by a combination of weight \nloss, good nutrition, and regular exercise.  Others may need\nmedication.\nBlood Sugar Levels\nThe level of glucose in the blood depends on several factors:\nwhen meals are eaten, how many calories are consumed,\nactivity level, and the dose of medication prescribed.  The\nstress of an illness may also alter the level of blood glucose.\nSuccessful daily management of diabetes may prevent or\nminimize emergencies that may result when blood sugar\nlevels are too high or too low.  Because these emergencies\ncan cause mental confusion or loss of consciousness, people\nwith diabetes should wear a medical alert identification\nand acquaint family members, friends, neighbors, and\ncoworkers with the signs and symptoms of an emergency\nand steps to a proper response.\nBlood sugar levels can be monitored with home testing\nmeters.  Testing not only measures the amount of sugar in\nthe blood but also enables the person to identify the reasons\nbehind high and low values so that adjustments can be made\nin the dose of diabetes medications.  Frequently the person\ncan learn how to adjust the dose of oral medication or\ninsulin to achieve the desired glucose value.  The health\ncare team caring for the person with diabetes can deter-\nmine reasonable blood sugar goals.\nNutrition\nThe old restrictive diets for diabetes no longer apply.  It is now\nknown that the best diet for diabetes control is consistent\nwith what everyone should eat for good health. How much\nyou eat is just as important as what you eat in controlling\nblood sugar.  To keep blood sugar on an even keel, people\nwith diabetes should not eat large meals or skip meals; they\nshould eat smaller servings at regular intervals instead.  As\nfor the menu, choices should follow Food Guide Pyramid\nrecommendations—emphasize whole grains, legumes, and\nvegetables.  These foods are higher in complex carbohy-\ndrate and fiber and can help control blood sugar.  Even\nthough fruit contains sugar, it should not be avoided.\nBecause people with diabetes are at higher risk for\ncardiovascular disease, it’s important to keep the fat intake\nto about 30 percent of total daily calories and to limit\ncholesterol-containing foods.  Items at the top of the Food\nGuide Pyramid—such as fats and sweets—should be eaten\nsparingly.  Research has shown that the total amount of\ncarbohydrate consumed at a given time, rather than the\ntype of carbohydrate, is the most important factor in control\nof blood sugar.  Therefore, if not present in excess, sugar can\nbe included as a part of a well-balanced meal.\nMany tools are available to help with meal planning.  For\nmost people, eating three meals at regular times and avoid-\ning excessive sweets are enough to control blood sugar.\nDietitians may provide a simple method, such as the Food\nGuide Pyramid, to encourage variety, proportion, and\n60\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nmoderation in food selections and to also ensure healthful\nfood choices.  Chapters 4 and 5 provide ideas for planning\nand preparing healthful meals.  Other techniques may be\nneeded and recommended by your physician, registered\ndietitian, or certified diabetes educator. \nWeight Control\nBecause many people who have diabetes are overweight,\nmaintaining a healthful weight and level of activity is the\nkey to keeping the disease under control and minimizing\nthe risk for serious complications.  The more overweight\npeople are, the more resistant their cells become to their own\ninsulin; losing weight decreases that resistance.  Often,\nweight loss of just 10 percent can improve blood sugar and\nhave lasting beneficial effects.  \nExercise\nWith exercise, some people with type 2 diabetes may even\nreduce or eliminate their need for insulin or oral diabetes\nmedication.  Anyone who has diabetes should check with\na physician before starting an exercise program.  Studies\nhave shown that those at high risk for diabetes who exercise\nhave a 50 percent lower incidence of type 2 diabetes.\nExercise helps control weight, makes cells more sensitive to\ninsulin, increases blood flow, and improves circulation in\neven the smallest blood vessels.  A leaner body also helps\nburn calories more efficiently.  Moreover, exercise lowers\nyour risk of cardiovascular disease. \nExercise can affect blood sugar levels up to 24 hours.  So\nif insulin is a part of the treatment plan, check with a\nphysician to receive guidelines for frequency of blood sugar\ntesting and insulin adjustment.\nMedications\nAlong with nutrition, weight control, and exercise, med-\nications may be necessary to achieve a desired glucose level.\nPersons with type 1 diabetes must take insulin by injection.\nInsulin cannot be taken by mouth because it breaks down\nin the digestive tract.  The type of insulin and number of\ndaily injections depend on individual needs.  Insulin also\ncan be administered by pump. \nIn some persons, type 2 diabetes can be managed by\nhealthful nutrition and exercise alone.  If the desired glucose\nlevel is not achieved, oral medications may be prescribed.\nThere are several classes of oral medications.  Some stimulate\nthe pancreas to produce more insulin, and some help insulin\nto work more effectively in the body by decreasing the\nsugar made by the liver and by increasing the sugar removed\nfrom the blood to the cells.  If oral medications do not\nachieve the glucose goal, insulin injections may be required. \nCORONARY ARTERY DISEASE\nKnowing your blood lipid (fat) levels—the various forms\nof cholesterol and triglycerides—is important.  But what\nthese numbers mean can be confusing, and how the\ndifferent types of cholesterol—not to mention other blood\nfats—relate to coronary artery (heart and blood vessel)\ndisease also can be a puzzle.\nCoronary artery disease is the number one killer of\nAmericans.  Studies point to certain abnormalities in cho-\nlesterol and triglyceride levels as a major contributor to\nthis problem.  There is plenty of good news to suggest that\npublic awareness of heart disease and its risk factors is\nmaking a difference.  Deaths from cardiovascular disease\ncontinue to decrease.  Much credit for this encouraging\ntrend goes to improved treatments and modification of\nthe risk factors for heart disease, including lowering\ncholesterol levels.  Despite these substantial improvements,\nthe American Heart Association reports that cardiovascular\ndisease still kills almost 1 million Americans each year. This\nis more than all cancer deaths combined.  More than 6\nmillion Americans experience symptoms due to coronary\nartery disease.  As many as 1.5 million Americans will have\na heart attack every year, and about half a million of them\nwill die. \nBlockage of the coronary arteries supplying the heart\nmuscle (which can lead to heart attack) causes more deaths,\ndisability, and economic loss than any other type of heart\ndisease.\nAtherosclerosis\nThe coronary arteries are the heart’s own circulatory system.\nThey supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients.\nThe heart uses this blood supply for energy to perform its\ncontinuous task of pumping.  Coronary artery disease can\ntake many different forms, but each has essentially the\nsame effect:  the heart muscle does not get enough blood\nand oxygen through the coronary arteries.  Consequently,\nits own demands for oxygen and nutrients are not met.\nThis condition can be either temporary or permanent.\nMost coronary artery disease is caused by atherosclerosis\n(also known as “hardening of the arteries”).  The term\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n61\n62\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nIn atherosclerosis, plaque deposits gradually accumulate\nin the lining of the arteries.  As the deposits enlarge,\nblood circulation is impaired.  This increases the risk\nfor heart attack, stroke, and other vascular problems.\n“atherosclerosis” comes from the Greek ather (meaning\n“porridge”) and sklerosis (meaning “hardening”).  Healthy\narteries are flexible, strong, and elastic.  The inner layer of\narteries is smooth, enabling blood to flow freely.\nAtherosclerosis can be a silent, painless process in which\ncholesterol-containing fatty deposits accumulate in the\nwalls of the arteries.  These accumulations occur as lumps\ncalled plaques.  As plaque deposits enlarge, the interior of\nthe artery narrows, and the flow of blood is then reduced\n(see the illustration below).  If reduced flow occurs in the\ncoronary (heart) arteries, it can lead to a type of chest pain\ncalled angina pectoris.\nAs a plaque enlarges, the inner lining of the artery\nbecomes rough.  A tear or rupture in the plaque may cause\na blood clot to form.  Such a clot can block the flow of\nblood or break free and plug another artery.  If the flow of\nblood to a part of the heart is stopped, a heart attack results.\nIf the blood flow to a part of the brain stops, a stroke occurs.\nAtherosclerotic\nplaque deposits\nA Closer Look at Blood Lipids\nMany factors influence the clogging of arteries, but cho-\nlesterol is a primary one.  Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like\nsubstance (a lipid). Although it is often discussed in negative\nterms, it is an essential component of the body’s cell mem-\nbranes.  It also serves to insulate nerves and is a building\nblock in the formation of certain hormones.  The liver uses\nit to make bile acids, which help digest food.\nConfusion about cholesterol is due in great part to the\nall-purpose use of the term.  Cholesterol has two sources:\nthe foods we eat (about 20%) and the cholesterol that is\nmade by the body (about 80%).  Dietary cholesterol is\nfound only in animal products, such as meat and dairy\nproducts, or foods made with animal products.  Examples\ninclude all meats, fish, and poultry, eggs, and milk\nproducts.  In addition, both the amount and the type of fat\neaten influence the blood cholesterol level.  Both saturated\n(primarily from animals) and trans-saturated (oils that have\nbeen processed to make them more solid) fats increase the\namount of cholesterol made by the liver.  (See Chapter 2,\npage 26, for further description of dietary fats.)\nUnique Roles: LDL and HDL Cholesterol\nand Triglycerides\nCholesterol and triglycerides are fats and are insoluble in the\nblood.  However, when they combine with protein they\nbecome lipoproteins and are able to dissolve in and be\ncarried by blood throughout the body.  (See sidebar:  Mini-\nGlossary of Lipid-Related Terms, above.)\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the main\ncholesterol carrier in the blood.  There is a direct relation-\nship between the level of LDL cholesterol (or total choles-\nterol) and the rate of coronary artery disease.  When there\nis too much LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood, it\ncan slowly build up in the walls of the arteries that feed\nthe heart and brain.  For this reason, LDL is often referred\nto as the “bad” cholesterol.  \nIf there are too many LDL particles in the blood, or the\nliver (the normal site of metabolism) does not remove LDL\nquickly enough from the blood, it builds, particularly in\nblood vessels.  It is the role of high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL) to counteract this effect. \nAbout a third to a fourth of blood cholesterol is carried\nby HDL.  HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries\nand back to the liver, where it is removed from the blood.\nIt is therefore often referred to as the “good” cholesterol.  A\nhigh level of HDL seems to protect against atherosclerosis\nand heart attack.  The opposite is also true:  a low HDL level\nindicates an increased risk of atherosclerosis.  Thus, the\ngoal is to have a high HDL cholesterol level and a low LDL\ncholesterol level.\nTriglycerides in the blood are derived from fats eaten in\nfoods or produced when the body converts excess calories,\nalcohol, or sugar into fat.  Most triglycerides are transported\nthrough the bloodstream as very low-density lipoprotein\n(VLDL).  Some cholesterol is also present in VLDL.\nA certain amount of triglycerides in the blood is normal.\nHormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat\ntissue to meet the body’s needs for energy between meals.\nHowever, at high levels, triglycerides may contribute to\nthe development of atherosclerosis.  Increased triglyceride\nlevels also may be a consequence of other diseases, such as\nuntreated diabetes mellitus.\nCalories ingested at a meal and not used immediately\nby tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to\nfat cells to be stored. \nBlood Testing\nThe only way to determine whether cholesterol and other\nblood lipids are in a desirable range is to have them measured\nby a blood test.  The National Cholesterol Education\nProgram guidelines recommend that total cholesterol, HDL\ncholesterol, and triglycerides be measured at least once\nevery 5 years in all adults age 20 or older.  However, your\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n63\n• Apolipoprotein—Proteins that combine with lipids to\nmake them dissolve in the blood.\n• Cholesterol—A soft, waxy substance in the blood \nand in all your body's cells.  It is used to form cell \nmembranes, some hormones, and other needed tissues.\nDietary cholesterol is found only in food derived from\nanimal sources.\n• HDL cholesterol—About 20 to 30 percent of blood\ncholesterol is carried by high-density lipoproteins\n(HDL).  HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries\nand back to the liver, where it is removed from the body.\nHDL seems to protect against heart attack.  This is why\nHDL cholesterol is referred to as the “good” cholesterol.\n• LDL cholesterol—Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \ncholesterol is the main cholesterol carrier in the blood.\nWhen there is too much LDL cholesterol circulating \nin the blood, it can slowly build up in the walls of the\narteries that feed the heart and brain.  This is why LDL\ncholesterol is often called the “bad” cholesterol.\n• Lipoproteins—Lipids combined with apoproteins.\n• Triglycerides—Triglycerides are derived from fats eaten\nin foods or made in the body from other sources such as\ncarbohydrates.  Calories ingested in a meal and not needed\nimmediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and\ntransported to fat cells to be stored.  Hormones regulate\nthe release of triglycerides from fat tissue to meet the\ndaily need for energy between meals.\n• VLDL cholesterol—In the fasting state, very low-density\nlipoproteins (VLDL) contain 15 to 20 percent of the total\nblood cholesterol, along with most of the triglycerides.\nMINI-GLOSSARY OF LIPID-RELATED TERMS\n64\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nphysician also may recommend that the screening include\nLDL cholesterol and triglycerides.\nTriglycerides must be measured after an overnight fast\nbecause eating can have a marked effect on blood triglyc-\neride levels.  Therefore, fast for at least 12 hours before\nblood is drawn.  Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before\nthe test.  If you have a risk factor(s) for heart disease, consult\nyour physician regarding the optimal frequency of testing.\n(See sidebar:  Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease\nOther Than LDL Cholesterol, below.)\nIn a sense, it is incorrect to think of a cholesterol (or\ntriglyceride) level as being strictly abnormal or normal.\nAlthough ranges of cholesterol levels have been identified\nwhich are considered “too high,” there is no “magic number”\nthat separates risky levels from safe levels.  Actually, the\nranges for adults are based on a consensus of experts.  They\nhave identified lipid levels in the blood above which the risk\nfor development of coronary complications is high enough\nto warrant medications or lifestyle changes. \nPeople with cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the\nhigher-risk zones are said to be hypercholesterolemic or\nhypertriglyceridemic (hyper means “high,” and emic means\n“in the blood”).  But, as with all risk factors, being in the\n“high” range does not guarantee that coronary artery disease\nwill develop, nor does being in the “low” range guarantee\navoiding it.\nBlood test numbers are only guidelines.  If the numbers\nstray from the desirable range, a physician can provide\nadvice on what to do.  Remember that each number takes\non greater meaning in light of the other lipid results and in\nthe presence of other cardiovascular disease risk factors (see\nsidebar:  Your Blood Lipid Test Results—What Do Those\nNumbers Mean? page 65).\nThe Reasons for High Blood Lipid Levels\nWhy do some people have high cholesterol and triglycerides?\nHigh levels may result from genetic makeup or lifestyle\nchoices or both.  Heredity may endow people with cells\nthat do not remove LDL or VLDL cholesterol from the\nblood efficiently, or with a liver that produces too much\ncholesterol as VLDL particles or too few HDL particles.\nLifestyle factors such as a high-fat diet, obesity, smoking,\nand physical inactivity also can cause or contribute to high\ncholesterol levels, increasing an individual’s risk for athero-\nsclerosis. \nFor a more complete picture of cardiovascular health,\nother risk factors—beyond cholesterol and triglycerides—\nmust be considered.  The more risk factors an individual has\nin combination with undesirable lipid levels, the greater\nthe chances for development of cardiovascular disease. \nThe risk factors for cardiovascular disease are divided\ninto those that can be changed and those that cannot. \nRisk Factors That Can Be Changed or Treated\nSmoking cigarettes damages the walls of the blood vessels,\nmaking them more receptive to the accumulation of fatty\ndeposits.  Smoking also may lower the HDL by as much as\n15 percent.  Quitting smoking may return the HDL to a\nhigher level.\nHigh blood pressure damages the walls of the arteries,\nthus accelerating the development of atherosclerosis.  Some\nmedications for high blood pressure increase LDL and\ntriglyceride levels and decrease HDL levels.  Others do\nnot.  Blood pressure that is properly managed decreases\nthe progression and risk for cardiovascular disease.\nSedentary lifestyle is associated with a decrease in HDL.\nAerobic exercise is one way to increase HDL.  Aerobic\nactivity is any exercise that requires continuous movement\nof the arms and legs and increases the rate of breathing.\nEven 30 to 45 minutes of brisk walking every other day\nhelps protect the cardiovascular system.\nObesity is a risk to cardiovascular health.  Excess body\nfat increases total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyc-\neride levels.  It also lowers the HDL cholesterol level.\nObesity increases blood pressure and the risk for diabetes,\nwhich can increase the chances of heart disease developing.\nLosing just 10 percent of excess body weight can improve\ntriglyceride and cholesterol levels.\nDiabetes can increase the triglyceride level and decrease\nthe HDL cholesterol level.  Good control of blood sugar\nhelps reduce increased triglyceride levels.\n•\nAge:  males 45 years or older and females age 55 years\nor older, or females who have had premature\nmenopause without estrogen replacement\n•\nFamily history of early coronary artery disease\n•\nCurrent cigarette smoking\n•\nHigh blood pressure\n•\nLow HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL)\n•\nDiabetes mellitus\nRISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE\nOTHER THAN LDL CHOLESTEROL\nEstrogen deficiency and menopause increase the risk\nof heart disease.  Conversely, estrogen replacement lowers\nthe risk in certain groups of estrogen-deficient women.\nRisk Factors That Cannot Be Changed\nAging—Aging usually increases the level of LDL cho-\nlesterol, although the reasons are not understood.  It could\nbe the aging process itself that causes this, or an increase in\nbody fat with advancing age.\nSex—Cardiovascular disease is not only a man’s disease, as\nonce thought.   It is the number one killer of women, claim-\ning the lives of 500,000 women every year.  Cardiovascular\ndisease occurs in women almost as often as it does in men.\nIt just happens later in life.  Before menopause, a woman’s\nrisk of  coronary artery disease is lower than that of  a man.\nMenopause results in an increase in LDL cholesterol and\na decrease in the protective HDL cholesterol.  After\nmenopause, a woman’s risk of heart disease is the same as that\nof a man.  Treatment with estrogen helps to return the risk\nto premenopausal levels.\nFamily history—A family history of abnormal lipid\nlevels or early heart disease increases the risk of heart attack\nand stroke. \nLifestyle Changes to Reduce Risk\nThere is significant opportunity to reduce the risk of getting\ncardiovascular disease.  Changes in nutrition along with\nincreased physical activity and learning to decrease stress can\nimprove blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Making\ndietary changes to improve blood cholesterol and triglyc-\neride levels involves these steps: \nMaintain a desirable weight—A diet that is high in fat\nalso can be unnecessarily high in calories and contribute to\nan unhealthy weight.  Decrease the total amount of fat\neaten.  Limit fat—saturated, polyunsaturated, and monoun-\nsaturated—to less than 30 percent of your total daily calories\n(see Chapter 2, pages 26 to 29, for a description of these\ntypes of fat).  Some individuals may need to restrict fats\neven more.  Because all foods with fats contain a combina-\ntion of these fats, it is important to reduce total fat.\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n65\nLEVEL (IN MG/DL)\nTEST\nOPTIMAL\nBORDERLINE\nUNDESIRABLE\nTotal cholesterol\nLess than 200\n200-240\nMore than 240\nHDL cholesterol\nConsidered \"good\"—the higher, the better\n60 or more\n–\nLess than 40\nLDL cholesterol*\nConsidered \"bad\"—the lower, the better\nLess than 100\n130-160\nMore than 160\nCholesterol/HDL ratio\nLess than 4.5\n4.5-5.5\nMore than 5.5\nLDL/HDL ratio\nLess than 3\n3-5\nMore than 5\nTriglycerides\nLess than 150\n150-200\nMore than 200\n*LDL may be measured directly or may be estimated from the other numbers if your triglyceride level is lower than 400 mg/dL.  \nYou can estimate LDL yourself by using this equation:  LDL = Total  Cholesterol - HDL + triglyceride level divided by 5.\nYOUR BLOOD LIPID TEST RESULTS—WHAT DO THOSE NUMBERS MEAN?\nUse this table as a general guide.  The importance of each number varies according to your sex, health status, \nand family history.  For example, if you already have heart disease, you will want to lower your \nLDL cholesterol level to less than 100 mg/dL.  Your health care provider can help clarify your specific risk.  \n66\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nReduce saturated fat—The major dietary culprit in an\nincreased blood cholesterol level and increased risk for\ncoronary artery disease, saturated fat is typically solid or\nwaxy at room temperature.  Minimize your intake of sat-\nurated fat.  Foods high in saturated fat include red meats\nand dairy products as well as coconut, palm, and other\ntropical oils (check the ingredient portion of the food label).\nReplace saturated fat with unsaturated fat—\nPolyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats should make up\nthe remaining fat allowance.  In the recommended amounts,\npolyunsaturated fats reduce LDL cholesterol, but at the\nexpense of the protective HDL cholesterol, whose levels\nalso may decrease.  Polyunsaturated fats are usually liquid\nat room temperature and in the refrigerator.  Vegetable oils\nsuch as safflower, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oil\nare high in polyunsaturated fat.  Monounsaturated fats\ntend to have the same effects on LDL cholesterol without\nlowering HDL cholesterol.  Monounsaturated fats are\nliquid at room temperature but may start to solidify in the\nrefrigerator.  Olive, canola, and nut oils are sources of\nmonounsaturated fats.  (See Chapter 2, pages 26 to 29,\nfor further discussion of unsaturated fats, and see sidebar:\nCholesterol-Lowering Margarine? below.)\nLimit trans fat—This fat is also called partially hydro-\ngenated vegetable oil.  This type of fat may be as harmful\nto your health as saturated fat because it increases blood\ncholesterol levels, among other effects.  Major sources are\nhardened vegetable fat, such as margarine or shortening, and\nproducts made from these fats, such as cereals, cookies,\nand crackers.\nReduce dietary cholesterol—The daily limit for dietary\ncholesterol is 300 milligrams.  Dietary cholesterol is found\nonly in foods made from or containing animal products.  A\ngood way to lower dietary cholesterol is to limit the amount\nof meat and dairy products.  Organ meats and egg yolks are\nalso high in cholesterol.  (See Chapter 2, page 27.)\nEat a plant-based diet—A diet that has generous\namounts of grains, vegetables, and fruits is naturally lower\nin fat and has good sources of soluble fiber and antioxidants,\nwhich may protect blood vessels from damage and plaque\nbuildup.  Chapters 4 and 5 present ideas for planning and\npreparing healthful meals.\nFruits and vegetables and whole-grain products are also\nnatural sources for folate—a B vitamin that controls the\namount of homocysteine in the blood.  Homocysteine is an\namino acid (a building block of protein) normally found in\nyour body.  Your body needs homocysteine to manufac-\nture protein to build and maintain tissue.\nProblems arise when there is too much homocysteine,\nwhich can cause the tissues lining the arteries to thicken and\nscar.  Cholesterol builds up in the scarred arteries, leading\nto clogged vessels and blood clots.  Adequate intake of this\nvitamin can help normalize homocysteine levels and may\nreduce the risk for cardiovascular disease (see sidebar: Folate\nand Heart Disease, page 67).  There is also accumulating evi-\ndence that vitamin E may reduce the risk of heart attack. \nCardiovascular Disease and Physical Activity\nUnfortunately, most of the population of the United States\nis sedentary.  Sedentary people have nearly twice the risk of\nhaving a fatal heart attack as active people of the same age\nwhen other factors—such as smoking and high choles-\nterol—are equal.  Consult a physician before embarking on\nan exercise program.  Then, follow these tips for maximal\nresults:\n•\nChoose an aerobic activity.  It can be something like\nwalking, jogging, bicycling, or swimming.\n•\nGradually increase the time and frequency of the exercise.\nWork up to exercising for 30 minutes daily.\nWhen Are Medications Necessary?\nIf changes in lifestyle have not brought lipid values into the\ngoal range, medication may be necessary.  Before recom-\nmending a medication, your physician will use careful judg-\nment and weigh many variables—sex, age, current health,\nfamily history of early heart disease or abnormal lipids,\nand the side effects of medication. \nWho would have thought a person could consume\nmargarine and possibly lower cholesterol? This functional\nfood was approved for use in the United States and was\nintroduced to the grocery shelves in 1999.  Two types are\navailable:  Benecol and Take Control.  Benecol is made\nwith a refined form of plant sterol called stanol ester, which\nis derived from wood pulp. Take Control contains sterol\nesters, which are made from vegetable oils, soybean, and\ncorn.  These new margarines may help lower LDL choles-\nterol when used as directed by a physician.  The margarines\nmay lower LDL cholesterol 7 to 10 percent.  Therefore,\nit is important that they be used in conjunction with a\nhealthful diet full of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and\none that is low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\nCHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MARGARINE?\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nThe word “osteoporosis” literally means “porous bones.”\nWith osteoporosis, bones become weak and brittle—so brit-\ntle that even mild stresses, such as bending over to pick up\na book, pushing a vacuum, or coughing, can cause a fracture.\nThe strength of your bones relates to their mass or den-\nsity and is in part due to the calcium, phosphorus, and other\nmineral levels.  In osteoporosis, the strength is decreased as\ncalcium and other minerals are slowly depleted and bone\ndensity is undermined.\nBone is living tissue that is continually changing—new\nbone is made and old bone is broken down, a process called\n“remodeling” or “bone turnover.”  The cells called osteoclasts\ndissolve or “resorb” old bone cells, leaving tiny cavities.\nAnother type of bone cells, called osteoblasts, line or fill these\ncavities with a soft honeycomb of protein fibers that become\nhardened by mineral deposits. \nA full cycle of bone remodeling takes 2 to 3 months.\nWhen you are young, your body makes new bone faster\nthan it breaks down old bone, and bone mass increases.\nPeak bone mass is reached in your mid-30s.  \nThe mineral-hardened honeycomb, which accounts for\nbone strength, depends on an adequate supply of calcium.\nEstrogen also plays a key role in bone health by slowing\nthe resorption of old bone and promoting new growth.\nWith aging, bone remodeling continues, but people\nlose slightly more than they gain.  At menopause, when\nestrogen levels decrease, bone loss accelerates to 1 to 3 percent\nper year.  Around age 60, bone loss slows again but it does\nnot stop.  Men can also have osteoporosis.  By an advanced\nage, women have lost between 35 and 50 percent of their\nbone mass, and men have lost 20 to 35 percent (see illus-\ntration on page 70).\nRisk Factors for Osteoporosis\nDespite the gloomy statistics, osteoporosis is not an\ninevitable part of aging.  With identification of the major\ncauses of the disease and their risk factors, osteoporosis can\nbe detected early and treated.  Moreover, a greater under-\nstanding of the role of nutrients and hormones and new and\ncontinually emerging medications are raising hopes for\nprevention of the disease.\nHow do you assess your personal chances for getting\nosteoporosis?  Listed below are several risk factors that\nshould be considered and evaluated:\nSex—One’s sex is the most significant indicator of risk.\nFractures from osteoporosis are about twice as common\nin women as in men.  Women build less bone than men by\nearly adulthood.  Women also generally consume less\ncalcium than men.  Prolonged calcium deficiency is a risk.\nMoreover, studies have documented a tendency for low\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n67\nFOOD\nSERVING\nFOLATE AMOUNT\n% DAILY VALUE\nSIZE\n(MICROGRAMS)\n(BASED ON 400\n(CUP)\nMICROGRAMS)\nBreakfast cereals\n1/2 to 1 \n100-400* \n25-100\n(check label)\nLentils (cooked)\n1/2\n180\n45\nChickpeas\n1/2\n140\n35\nAsparagus\n1/2\n130\n33\nSpinach\n1/2\n130\n33\nBlack beans\n1/2\n130\n33\nKidney beans\n1/2\n115\n29\n*Manufacturers of grain-based foods now fortify their products with folic acid—a synthetic form of the vitamin.\nFOLATE AND HEART DISEASE\nHomocysteine is an amino acid that is made from dietary protein.  Too much homocysteine can damage \narterial walls, allowing fatty plaque deposits to clog arteries and promote blood clotting.\nFolate can decrease homocysteine\nlevels.  About 400 micrograms a \nday is enough to lower your blood\nconcentration of homocysteine.  To\nget more folate, eat plenty of beans,\nfruits, and vegetables—preferably \nraw or lightly cooked.  Half the folate\nin foods can be lost in cooking.\ncalcium intake among adolescent girls—a time at which\ncalcium is especially needed for bone development.\nFamily history—Having a mother or sister with the\ndisease may increase your risk.\nRace—Whites are at greatest risk, followed by Hispanics\nand Asians.  African-Americans have the lowest risk.  Whites\nhave a higher risk because they generally attain a lower\npeak bone mass than the others.\nAge—The older an individual, the higher the risk for\nosteoporosis.\nSmall body frame—In general, the smaller the body\nframe, the thinner the bone.\nLifestyle choices—Smoking increases bone loss, per-\nhaps by decreasing the amount of estrogen the body makes\nand reducing the absorption of calcium in the intestine.\nIn addition, women smokers tend to enter menopause ear-\nlier than nonsmokers—a significant risk factor in itself.\nConsumption of too much caffeine or alcohol can lead to\nbone loss.  A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor. Weight-\nbearing physical activity strengthens bones.\nProlonged calcium deficiency does not merely mean\nthat newly consumed calcium is not going into the bones.\nBecause the body also needs calcium circulating in the\nblood, it will “rob” calcium from the bones to provide ade-\nquate calcium in the blood. \nEstrogen deficiency—The less a woman’s lifetime\nexposure to estrogen, the higher her risk for osteoporosis.\nFor example, a woman will have a higher risk if she has an\nearly menopause or began menstruating at a later age.  Early\nmenopause due to surgical removal of the ovaries also\nincreases the risk for osteoporosis. \nWomen generally experience a sudden drop in estrogen\nat menopause, which accelerates bone loss.  Men experience\na much more gradual decline in the production of testos-\nterone, and therefore they do not experience as rapid a loss\nof bone mass.  Recent evidence suggests that estrogen also\nmay play an important role in bone metabolism in men.\nThere also can be a deficiency of estrogen as a result of\nvery low weight caused by eating disorders such as anorex-\nia nervosa or excessive physical activity.  \n68\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nHOW YOU GROW SHORTER\nIn osteoporosis, bones become porous and weak.  \nBones in the spine can compress, causing loss in height. \nImmobilization—This robs bones of the weight-bear-\ning exercise that can help to build bone mass.  Someone who\nis bedridden or otherwise off their feet for any extended\nperiod could have such a problem. \nMedications—Some medications can contribute to\nosteoporosis.  Long-term use of corticosteroids, such as\nprednisone, cortisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone,\nis very damaging to bone.  People who need to take such\nmedications for other conditions (for example, asthma,\nrheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis) should have their bone\ndensity monitored because they may require treatment to\nslow the rate of bone loss.  Too much thyroid hormone\ncaused by an overactive thyroid gland or excess thyroid\nreplacement also can cause bone loss.  In addition, other\nmedications also can adversely affect bone health.  If you\nare at risk for osteoporosis, your physician will take this\ninto account when prescribing medications.\nBone Health\nAn individual’s risk for the development of osteoporosis\ndepends on how much bone mass has been attained by age\n25 to 35 (peak bone mass) and how rapidly it is lost after-\nward.  The higher the peak bone mass, the more bone a\nperson has “in the bank” and the less likely that person is\nto develop osteoporosis as bone is lost during normal aging\nor during menopause.\nThe decrease in bone mass and the microscopic dete-\nrioration of the skeleton can lead to an increased risk of\nbone fragility and fractures, back pain, and a loss of height\n(see illustration on page 70).  The most common fractures\nresulting from osteoporosis include vertebra, hip, forearm,\nand wrist.  Fractures can also easily occur in other bones.  \nFractures can severely compromise lifestyle and limit\nmobility.  If an older woman breaks a hip, for instance,\nshe has only a 25 percent chance of ever resuming her\nformer level of physical activity.  A broken hip can easily be\nthe end of an independent way of living or even contribute\nto an early death from complications of operation or immo-\nbilization.  Once you have had a fracture, there is an\nincreased risk of having another.\nAlthough osteoporosis generally is considered a disease\nthat plagues elderly women, it can begin in others in their\n40s and 50s.  This potential crippler affects 8 to 10 million\nAmerican women and about 2 million older American\nmen.  The cost of osteoporosis to the American economy\nis about $13 billion per year.  Given current aging trends,\nthese costs will increase dramatically in the coming decades.\nTesting for Osteoporosis\nPhysicians can detect early signs of osteoporosis with a\nsimple, painless bone density test.  This test uses x-ray or\nultrasound technology to measure bone density at likely\nsites for fractures.  The test also can predict the risk of\nfuture fractures.  Measuring bone density helps identify\nindividuals who have osteoporosis or the threat of osteo-\nporosis.  (See sidebar:  Recommendations for Measuring\nBone Mineral Density in Women, below.)  In addition,\nother tests for osteoporosis are being developed and tested.  \nReducing the Risk for Osteoporosis\nAlthough osteoporosis may not be fully preventable,\nresearchers are agreeing that the following steps can delay\nits onset or improve the treatment outlook and thereby\nthe quality of life.\nMaximal Bone Mass\nBuilding maximal bone mass will make bone fractures later\nin life less likely.  Maximal bone density depends partly on\nthe inherited ability to make bone, the amount of calci-\num consumed, and the level of exercise.\nEstrogen Replacement Therapy\nEstrogen replacement therapy is the single most important\nway for women to reduce their risk for osteoporosis during\nand after menopause, provided there is understanding of the\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n69\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists\nrecommends a bone density test to assess the risk of\nosteoporosis in women—around the time of menopause\nor after menopause—who are concerned about osteo-\nporosis and willing to accept available treatment.  \nThis includes women who:\n•\nhave x-ray findings that suggest the presence \nof osteoporosis\n•\nare beginning or receiving long-term glucocorticoid \ntherapy (such as prednisone)\n•\nare perimenopausal or postmenopausal and have\nparathyroid disease\n•\nare undergoing treatment for osteoporosis, as a way \nof monitoring the effects of therapy \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEASURING BONE\nMINERAL DENSITY IN WOMEN\nrisks and benefits of this type of therapy and it is closely\nmonitored by a physician.  Estrogen receptors are present\nin bone, and estrogen inhibits bone breakdown.  Estrogen\nreplacement therapy can decrease or prevent bone loss and\nreduce the risk of spine and hip fractures by as much as\n50 percent.  For women who already have osteoporosis (and\nwho have no conditions prohibiting the use of estrogen),\nstarting estrogen replacement therapy can increase bone\ndensity by as much as 10 percent in the spine and 5 percent\nin the hip.\nHowever, there are some risks associated with estrogen\nreplacement therapy.  Taking estrogen alone, without its\nnatural balancing hormone progesterone, increases the risk of\ncancer of the uterus.  And there may be a small increase in\nthe risk of breast cancer from long-term use of estrogen.\nHowever, estrogen treatment may help decrease the risk\nof heart disease in certain groups and may also decrease\nthe risk of other diseases, such as dementia.\nWomen who have breast or uterine cancer, uncontrolled\nhigh blood pressure, or a tendency to form blood clots\nshould avoid estrogen.  If blood triglyceride levels are high,\nwomen should consult their physicians to see if an alternative\nform of estrogen is an option.  There are new types of estro-\ngen (estrogen analogs) that may prevent or slow the rate of\nbone loss without the increased risk of breast cancer.\nHowever, these drugs may not be as effective as estrogen and\nmay not have all of the beneficial effects.  In addition to\nestrogen and estrogen analogs, other types of medications\nare available and new ones are under development to prevent\nand treat osteoporosis.\nCalcium and Vitamin D\nAdequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D are critical for\nbuilding peak bone mass in younger years and for slowing\nbone loss in later years (see sidebar:  How Much Vitamin\nD Is Enough? page 71).\nCalcium is a vital mineral in the body.  In addition to\nbeing one of the essential building blocks of bone, calcium\nis essential to the function of the muscles (including the\nheart) and the function of the nerves, and it helps the blood\nto clot in case of injury.  If people fail to get enough calcium\nin their diets, their bodies will take calcium from the bones to\nkeep the blood calcium level constant.  Recommendations\nfor calcium vary a bit according to age and medical status.\nFor ages 9 to 18, 1,300 milligrams of calcium daily is recom-\nmended.  For ages 19 to 50, the recommendation is 1,000\nmilligrams.  Finally, for ages 51 or older, 1,200 milligrams\nis recommended.  During pregnancy and lactation, the\nrecommendation is 1,300 milligrams.\n70\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nAlthough osteoporosis mainly affects women, 2 million\nmen have the disease, including one-third of men older\nthan 75 years.  Warning signs in men include a change \nin posture or sudden back pain.  But the most common\nway osteoporosis is diagnosed in men is because of a loss\nof height or a fracture.\nSmoking and drinking excessively are significant risk\nfactors for osteoporosis in men.  In addition, men have\nmost of the same risk factors as women—use of medica-\ntions that accelerate bone loss, lack of exercise, smoking,\nexcessive alcohol use, and inadequate calcium intake or\nabsorption.  Low testosterone also may increase the risk.\nYour physician can determine whether a bone mineral\ndensity test is needed.\nPrevention strategies include getting adequate\ncalcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise and\nconsuming no more than 2 alcoholic drinks a day.\nOSTEOPOROSIS IN MEN\n0\n10\n20\n30 \n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nBONE DENSITY OVER TIME\nBone density, which varies by sex and race, peaks in your\nmid-30s and then slowly declines with age.  In general, the\nhigher your peak bone mass, the lower your risk of having\nfractures caused by osteoporosis.\nMales\nBone Density\nAge, years\nFemales\nThe richest dietary sources of calcium are milk, cheese,\nand yogurt.  Other sources of calcium are broccoli, turnip\ngreens, canned fish with bones, and calcium-fortified orange\njuice and tofu.  Of course, if you are trying to get extra\ncalcium through your diet, you should monitor your weight;\nfoods such as whole milk, certain cheeses, and ice cream are\nrich in calories and fat (see sidebar:  Food Sources of\nCalcium, below).  Chapters 4 and 5 also present ideas for\nplanning and preparing healthful meals.\nDepending on dietary choices and habits, food alone can\nprovide the recommended amounts of calcium.  If you are\nunsure of the calcium content of foods, follow this simple\nformula for estimating intake of dietary calcium:  assign\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n71\nHOW MUCH VITAMIN D IS ENOUGH?\nRecommended Intake for Vitamin D\nAGE\nDAILY AMOUNT\nDAILY AMOUNT\n(YEARS)\n(MICROGRAMS)\n(INTERNATIONAL UNITS)\n9-50 \n5\n200\n51-70 \n10\n400\n71+ \n15\n600\nPregnancy \nand lactation\n5\n200 \nNote:  1 microgram = 40 international units (IU) of vitamin D.\nFOOD ITEM\nAMOUNT\nCALCIUM\nCALORIES\n(MILLIGRAMS)\nMilk  \nSkim \n1 cup\n300\n85\n2 percent \n1 cup\n300\n120\nWhole \n1 cup \n300\n150\nNonfat, dry \n1/3 cup\n285\n90\nYogurt  \nPlain, low-fat \n1 cup \n400\n145\nFruited, low-fat \n1 cup\n300\n225\nFrozen, low-fat \n1 cup\n200\n200\nPudding\nSkim milk\n1/2 cup\n150\n105\nIce cream\n1/2 cup\n90\n130\nIce milk  \n1/2 cup\n90\n90\nCheese\nSwiss \n1 ounce\n270\n110\nCheddar  \n1 ounce\n205\n115\nMozzarella (part skim) \n1 ounce\n185\n70\nCottage cheese\nWhole milk \n1 cup\n125\n220\n2 percent milk (low-fat)  \n1 cup\n155\n205\nAmerican cheese (processed) \n1 ounce \n105\n175\nSalmon (canned with bones) \n3 ounces\n205\n130\nSardines (canned with bones) \n4 sardines\n185\n100\nPapaya\n1 medium\n75\n120\nOrange\n1 medium \n50\n60\nMacaroni and cheese   \n1 cup\n360\n430\nPizza with cheese  \n1 slice\n230\n280\nTofu (calcium-fortified)  \n1/2 cup\n130\n90\nAlmonds  \n1 ounce\n75\n175\nFOOD SOURCES OF CALCIUM\napproximately 300 milligrams for the baseline diet, and\nadd 300 milligrams for each serving of a dairy product\n(cup or slice) and 160 milligrams for each serving of a\ncalcium-fortified food that you eat.

If\nelemental calcium is not listed on the label, the amount can\nbe calculated as follows:\n• Calcium carbonate (40 percent calcium):\nmultiply total amount of calcium carbonate by 0.4\n• Calcium citrate (21 percent calcium):\nmultiply total amount of calcium citrate by 0.21\n• Calcium lactate (13 percent calcium):\nmultiply total amount of calcium lactate by 0.13\n• Calcium gluconate (9 percent calcium):\nmultiply total amount of calcium gluconate by 0.09\nLook for “USP” on the label.  The U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)\nsets standards for quality that manufacturers must meet.\nThese supplements meet the requirements for quality, purity,\nand tablet disintegration and will be better absorbed.\nEnhance calcium absorption—Various factors may affect\ncalcium absorption:\n• Take supplements with meals—Although some foods\nmay interfere with calcium absorption, taking a\nsupplement with meals is more convenient.  Many\nolder adults also have reduced levels of stomach acid.\nEating stimulates acid production and may enhance\noverall absorption.\n• Add vitamin D—Be sure to get adequate vitamin D\nin your diet.  Vitamin D helps increase the absorption\nof calcium.  If you are in doubt, take a standard\nmultivitamin, which includes 400 units, the recom-\nmended standard. \nMinimize side effects—Some forms of calcium may be gas-\nforming and constipating.  To minimize these effects, drink\nplenty of water, take the supplement with a meal, and take\nseveral smaller doses during the day.  Try different calcium\ncompounds to find one with fewer side effects.\nTIPS FOR SELECTING AND TAKING A CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT\nIf a calcium supplement is indicated, here are tips to help decide which type of calcium to take and how to take it.\nWeight-bearing exercise increases bone\ndensity, muscle strength, and coordination,\nwhich can lower your risk for osteoporosis,\nfalls, and broken bones.\nmidday sun 2 or 3 times a week can provide sufficient\nvitamin D—although not from a winter sun in a northern\nclimate.  Older adults or persons with certain diseases\noften benefit from a supplement.  A multivitamin pill\nwith 400 international units of vitamin D provides an\nadequate amount.\nCaffeine\nLimiting caffeine is a prudent idea.  Too much caffeine can\ncause extra calcium to be lost in the urine.  If an individual\nhas only 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day and is consuming enough\ncalcium in the diet, there should be no problem.\nAlcohol\nConsuming more than 2 drinks a day can inhibit bone\nformation and interfere with calcium absorption.\nSmoking\nSmoking decreases your body’s ability to form healthy\nbones.\nWeight-Bearing Exercise\nWeight-bearing exercise is any activity done while the bones\nare supporting the body’s weight.  It can slow bone loss,\nstrengthen the bones and back, improve posture, and aid\nin balance, which helps prevent falls.  Exercises in which\nbone sustains repeated impact have added benefit because,\nfor example, the leg bones respond to the impact of the\nfeet striking the ground by slowing bone loss.  Remember,\nit is never too late to begin an exercise program.\nBone-building exercises for prevention of osteoporosis\ninclude walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skiing,\nand impact-producing sports.  Because strong muscles exert\nmore force, and bones respond by becoming stronger,\nweight lifting (or strength training) is another excellent\nway to forestall osteoporosis.  Of course, anyone with osteo-\nporosis may benefit by consulting with a physician to design\na safe exercise program.\nTrauma\nAvoiding trauma is a given at any stage of life, but even\nmore so for persons with osteoporosis.  Wear sturdy, low-\nheeled shoes with nonslip soles, and check your home for\npotential obstacles that could cause a fall, such as low tables,\nloose rugs, or inadequate lighting.  The broken bones that\ncome from tumbles and falls can produce serious, even\nlife-threatening, medical complications.\nCANCER\nMany people have a fear of cancer, perhaps because to them\nit is always an incurable disease.  The facts do not support\nthis idea. \nCountless numbers of Americans who are alive today\nhave had cancer and are now considered to be cured.\n(“Cured” is defined here as being free of any evidence of the\ndisease for 5 years or more.)  They may have the same life\nexpectancy as others of the same age and sex who have\nnever had cancer, and they can anticipate leading mean-\ningful and productive lives.\nDespite such impressive statistics, cancer remains a\nserious disease.  Annually, cancer is diagnosed in more than\na million people (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer)\nand is one of the most significant causes of mortality in\nthe United States. \nThere are more than 100 different types of cancer.  Some\ncancers affect just one organ, and others are more general-\nized.  In each of its types, however, cancer is characterized\nby the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells\n(see illustration on page 74).\nWhy cancer develops in some people who are exposed\nto potentially cancer-causing agents but not in others is\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n73\n“Cancer” is derived from a Latin word meaning “crab”\nand was first described in writings attributed to Hippocrates\nand other Greek physicians (500 B.C. to 200 A.D.).\nThese physicians described various tumors and classified\nthem as either “carcinos” (benign growths that do not\nspread) or as “carcinomas” or “crab-like” (growths that\ninvade surrounding tissues and cause death).  The term\n“neoplasm” was described by Galen (200 A.D.) as mean-\ning “new growth that is contrary to nature.”  The word\n“metastasis” is also a Greek word meaning “to change\nplaces.”  It is used to describe the ability of cancer to migrate\nto other tissues or organs and to form additional tumors.\nCANCER TERMS—ANCIENT AND MODERN\nCancer is a disease we have known about since \nancient times.  The terms used to describe cancer \ncome from ancient languages.\nneoplasm\nCancer\ncarcinos\nmetastasis\nAny number of dietary factors may be related to the risk\nof cancer.  \nThe Biology of Cancer\nA biomedical revolution is advancing knowledge of the\ncauses of cancer, yielding new and more effective treatments\nand inspiring greater hope for cancer prevention.  This\nrevolution is built on scientific investigation of the basic\nprocesses that cause cancer.\nThe body is a living, growing system that contains\nbillions of individual cells.  These cells carry out all of the\nbody’s functions, such as metabolism, transportation,\nexcretion, reproduction, and locomotion.  The body grows\nand develops as a result of increases in numbers of new\ncells and their changes into different types of tissue.  New\ncells are created through the process of cell division (mitosis).\nDifferent types of cells are created by a process called cell\ndifferentiation, by which they acquire specialized function.\nCell division results in the normal pattern of human growth;\n74\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nCancer cells, left untreated,\ninvade and penetrate the walls\nof blood and lymph vessels.\nOnce in these systems, they\ntravel to other sites, such as \nthe lungs, bone, or brain.\nPrimary tumor\nNormal tissue cell\nInvading tumor cell\nBlood vessel\nnot fully understood.  But what is known is that many\ncancers develop slowly.  It may be 5 to 40 years after expo-\nsure to a cancer-causing agent before there is any evidence\nof the disease.  Cancer of the lung, for example, may not\nappear until 25 years or more after sustained exposure to\ntobacco smoke.  This long delay between exposure and\ndevelopment of the disease may partly explain why so many\npeople ignore the warnings associated with smoking. \nThe Nutrition-Cancer Connection\nDuring the past 30 years, research has shown that nutri-\ntion plays a significant role in the development of many\ncancers and that proper food choices might help to reduce\nthe risk of cancer or even prevent it.  About a third of\nthe 500,000 cancer deaths that occur each year in the\nUnited States can be attributed to dietary factors.  The\ngood news is that in addition to engaging in regular exer-\ncise and not smoking, people have control over this impor-\ntant factor in cancer development—their food choices.\ncell differentiation makes possible the normal, orderly\npattern of growth and development.\nUnlike normal cells, cancer cells lack the control mech-\nanisms that stop, or “switch off,” growth.  They divide\nwithout restraint, displacing neighboring normal cells,\naffecting their normal function and growth, and compet-\ning with them for available nutrients.  These uncontrolled\ncells can grow into a mass called a tumor and invade and\ndestroy nearby normal tissue.  They also can migrate in a\nprocess called “metastasis,” spreading via the blood or\nlymph system to other parts of the body.  Not all cells that\nhave rapid or uncontrolled growth are cancerous.  Cells\nmay amass as benign tumors, which do not invade or\ndestroy surrounding tissues.\nAlthough science has yet to understand the processes by\nwhich all cells grow, divide, communicate, and differentiate,\nmuch has been learned about how normal cells are activated\nor altered into cancerous cells in both inherited and non-\ninherited forms of cancer.\nThe Causes of Cancer\nCancer is caused by factors that are external (chemicals,\nradiation, viruses, and diet) and internal (hormones,\nimmune and metabolic conditions, and inherited [genet-\nic] alterations).  Some of these factors are avoidable; oth-\ners are not.  Scientists have identified many of the\ncontrollable risk factors that increase the chances of get-\nting cancer.  A complex mix of these factors, acting togeth-\ner or in some cascade of events, promotes cancer cell growth.\nWhen the genetic programming of a normal cell is\ndisrupted, its malignant potential is released.  Everyone\ncarries this malignant potential within them in normal\ngenes known as proto-oncogenes.  Products of these genes\nperform useful functions, such as regulating cell division and\ncell differentiation.  These functions, however, may be\ncompromised with aging or by exposure to cancer-causing\n(carcinogenic) agents.  When this happens, they may be\nactivated to become oncogenes, coordinating the conver-\nsion of normal cells to cancer cells.\nNutrition can influence any of the steps involved in\nthe development of cancer.  The development of cancer\n(carcinogenesis) and its relationship to nutrition is a com-\nplex process.  Isolating and proving dietary cause-and-effect\nrelationships can be difficult.  In addition, studies can be con-\nfusing and sometimes show conflicting results.  Nevertheless,\nthe potential for nutrition to increase or decrease the risk of\nvarious cancers is compelling.\nDietary Guidelines to Reduce the Risk \nof Cancer\nJust as negative dietary and lifestyle choices can signifi-\ncantly increase the risk of cancer, evidence is mounting\nthat appropriate food choices can be powerful tools in\nreducing risk and even defensive shields in preventing\ncancer.  The American Cancer Society offers these four\nguidelines to reduce cancer risk: \n•\nChoose most of the foods you eat from plant sources.\n•\nLimit your intake of high-fat foods, particularly from\nanimal sources.\n•\nBe physically active: achieve and maintain a healthful\nweight (see Chapter 1, page 8).\n•\nLimit consumption of alcoholic beverages, if you drink\nat all.\nThe Society’s recommendations are consistent with the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid and\nthe Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see Chapter 1, pages\n8 and 11).  Although no diet can guarantee full protection\nagainst disease, the American Cancer Society believes that\nthese recommendations offer the best nutrition information\ncurrently available to help reduce your risk of cancer.\nChapters 4 and 5 provide ideas for planning and preparing\nhealthful meals.\nChoose Most of the Foods You Eat From Plant Sources\nChoosing foods from plant sources is vital to a healthful diet.\nMany scientific studies have shown that increased con-\nsumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains reduces\nthe risk for cancers of the gastrointestinal and respiratory\ntracts and for lung cancer.  This reduction is one of the\nreasons foods of plant origin form the basis of the Food\nGuide Pyramid.  \nPlant foods contain beneficial vitamins, minerals, fibers,\nand hundreds of other cancer-protective substances.\nAlthough more research is needed to understand what\nspecific properties or substances in plant foods may specif-\nically protect against cancer, there are already many\ncandidates under investigation—from vitamins and minerals\nto fiber and phytochemicals (including carotenoids,\nflavonoids, terpenes, sterols, indoles, and phenols).  Because\nthe positive effects from these components may derive from\nthe whole foods in which they are found, experts\nrecommend food over supplements (see sidebar:  Food\nVersus Supplements, page 76; and see Chapter 2,\nPhytochemicals—A Food Pharmacy That May Fight\nDisease, page 35).\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n75\nAntioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may help to\nprevent cancer.  These are nutrients that seem to offer the\nbody some protection against oxidation—damage done to\ntissue in the course of normal cellular function which may\ncontribute to the effects of aging and to increased cancer\nrisk.  Various antioxidant nutrients—including vitamin\nC, vitamin E, selenium, and carotenoids —may provide the\nbody with some defense against cancer.  Researchers are\nstudying the protective role of antioxidants (see sidebar:\nFood Sources of Antioxidants, page 32, and see Appendix,\nPhytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484).\nGrains provide vitamins and minerals, such as folate,\ncalcium, and selenium, which may also protect against\ncancer.  Whole grains are preferable to refined grains because\nthey have more fiber and an abundance of certain vitamins\nand minerals.  Beans and legumes are also good sources of\nnutrients that have cancer-protective qualities.  (See page\n20 for more information about fiber.)\nAlthough more research is needed to clarify the specific\nroles of these food components, there is still ample evidence\nto support eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegeta-\nbles a day (especially deep-green and dark-yellow to orange\nfruits and vegetables, those from the cabbage family, and\nlegumes and soy products) and 6 to 11 servings of grains\n(with an emphasis on whole grains).\nLimit High-Fat Foods, Particularly From Animal\nSources\nDecreasing the intake of high-fat foods, especially from\nanimal sources, is very important.  Studies show that people\nwho eat a high-fat diet have increased rates of cancers of the\ncolon, rectum, prostate, and endometrium (lining of the\nuterus).  Although these relationships exist, it is not clear\nwhether they are due to the total amount of fat in the diet,\nto a particular kind of fat (saturated, monounsaturated, or\npolyunsaturated), or to another, unknown, factor. \nBecause fat, by weight, contains twice the number of\ncalories than protein or carbohydrate, it is difficult to\nseparate the effects of the fat from the effects of its calories.\nPeople who eat a high-fat diet are often heavier and tend\nto eat fewer fruits and vegetables, which also increases\ncancer risk.\nConsumption of red meat, a major source of fat in the\nAmerican diet, is linked to an increased cancer risk,\nparticularly of the colon and prostate.  Scientists are unable\nto determine whether the connection between red meat\nand cancer is due to total fat, saturated fat, or other com-\npounds.  Meat contains compounds linked to cancer, such\nas heterocyclic amines, which are produced when it is\ncooked (see sidebar:  Meat—Cooking and Cancer, page 77).\nThis may be a link to colon cancer. \n76\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nA diet that contains ample amounts of fruits and vegetables \nis associated with a reduced risk for cancer. There is no\nevidence that mineral or vitamin supplements are better\nthan obtaining nutrients through whole foods.  In fact,\nstudies in which subjects received supplements of beta-\ncarotene showed conflicting and even harmful results.\nSmokers given supplemental beta-carotene had a higher\nincidence of lung cancer.  Other studies of supplemental\nbeta-carotene have shown neither benefit nor harm.\nThere are more than 500 known carotenoids.  Of these,\nonly a few have been analyzed:  alpha-carotene, beta-carotene,\ngamma-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.  At this\ntime, it is not known which exerts benefits—or risks.\nExperts recommend a diet rich in fruits, grains, and\nvegetables rather than taking supplements.  Plants contain\nhundreds of cancer-protective substances.  It is not known\nwhich of the substances may specifically protect against can-\ncer.  In addition, it is not known whether these substances\nwork independently or benefit from working together.\nPlus, relying on supplements rather than eating a variety \nof foods makes it impossible to benefit from these now\nunknown food compounds.\nFOOD VERSUS SUPPLEMENTS\nEvery day there seems to be a headline announcing that some nutrient or food compound has been linked \nto preventing some sort of cancer.  Driving this is the tremendous amount of research \nexploring specific food components and their role in the cancer process.\nDO SUPPLEMENTS OFFER CANCER PROTECTION?\nDifferent fats (such as omega-3 fatty acids and vegetable\noil) may have different effects on your risk of cancer.\nSaturated fat is a particular concern for cancer risk and for\ncoronary artery disease. \nHow food is prepared is also important.  Some cooking\nmethods, such as baking, stewing, boiling, and poaching,\nare healthier ways than frying, broiling, or grilling. \nLimit Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages\nPeople who drink excessive amounts of alcohol have an\nincreased risk of cancer, higher than that of the general\npopulation, especially cancer of the larynx, esophagus,\nstomach, and pancreas.\nThere is no question that limiting alcohol consump-\ntion reduces cancer risk.  The risk of cancer begins to\nincrease with an intake of as few as 2 drinks a day.  Alcohol\nChapter 3:  The Food-Health Connection\n77\nTYPE OF FOOD\nHCA is found in cooked muscle meats.  Other protein\nsources (milk, eggs, tofu, and organ meats such as liver)\nhave little or no HCA naturally or when cooked.\nTEMPERATURE\nCooking temperature is the most important factor in \nreducing the formation of HCA.  Cooking in an oven at\n400° Fahrenheit or less or stewing, boiling, or poaching \nat 212° Fahrenheit or less forms one-third of HCAs versus\nmeats prepared by frying, broiling, or grilling.\nCOOKING METHOD\nFrying, broiling, and barbecuing produce the largest amounts\nof HCA—these methods have higher than recommended\ncooking temperatures. Microwaving meats for 2 minutes\nhelps to decrease HCA.  Meats that are microwaved before\nfrying, broiling, or grilling have a 90 percent decrease in\nHCA content.  Marinating meats before cooking also\ninhibits the production of HCA.\nTIME\nMeats cooked well done (no pink remaining in center) have\nmore HCA than those cooked medium.\nMEAT—COOKING AND CANCER\nCooking meat at high temperatures creates chemicals that are not present in uncooked meats.  \nHeterocyclic amines (HCAs) are chemicals linked to cancer that are formed when meat is \nexposed to high temperatures.  Four factors influence HCA formation:\nalong with tobacco use produces a combined cancer risk that\nis greater than the sum of their individual effects.  The\nrisks for cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and\nlarynx are particularly increased.\nResearch also has noted a connection between alcohol\nconsumption and an increased risk of breast cancer.  Although\nthe causes are not known, scientists speculate that alcohol\nmay have a carcinogenic effect, perhaps reflected in its\ncapacity to alter hormone levels.\nDrinking too much alcohol also may negatively affect\neating habits.  The calories in alcohol—with little nutri-\ntional value—are perhaps being consumed in place of\ncalories in healthier foods with cancer-protective values.  A\ngeneral rule:  men should limit themselves to no more\nthan 2 drinks a day, women to 1.  (See page 387 for a\nfurther discussion about alcohol.)\nIn this chapter you will learn:\n•\nHow to plan and select healthful meals\nwhether eating at home or away\n•\nHow to shop for the healthiest foods\n•\nHow to read food labels and interpret\nnutrient and health claims\n•\nHow changes in technology, such as the\nuse of pesticides, irradiation, additives,\ngenetic engineering, and organic grow-\ning methods, affect our food\nW\nhatever your style of eating, several simple planning\ntechniques will help ensure that your food is varied,\nnutritious, and enjoyable. In this chapter you will learn\nhow to plan and select healthful meals—whether pre-\npared at home or eaten away from home.  You also\nwill be introduced to strategies to make your shop-\nping both efficient and effective.  Also discussed\nare some of the new (and not so new) issues in\nfoods that are of current interest.  The chap-\nter ends with 2 weeks of healthful\nmenus—just to get you started.\nPLAN TO “EAT WELL”\n“Eat” and “well” are the key\nwords.  To do so, you must\nbe conscious of what\nyou eat and how often\nyou eat.  Try to eat\nat regular times.\nFor most of us,\nthis means eating\nbreakfast, a mid-\nday meal, and an\nGuide Pyramid to help you make healthful selections.\nTry to be sure that your meals and snacks are rich in\nplant foods (fruits, vegetables, and grains), because,\nounce for ounce, plant-based meals are almost always\nlower in fat and calories than meat-based meals.\nAlthough meat and dairy foods contain\nmany nutrients, they also can be very high\nin unwanted saturated fat.  The key is to\navoid high-fat types of meats, make an\neffort to eat smaller amounts of the\nlower-fat meats, and focus on low-\nfat dairy products.  Vary your food\nchoices. Try foods that are new\nto you.  Remember that fats\nand sweets are at the top of\nthe Pyramid, which means\nenjoy them, but do so\nonly on occasion and in\nmoderation.  (See\nChapter 1, the Food\nGuide Pyramid,\npage 11.)\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nr\n \nf\no\nu\nr\nPLANNING\nMEALS\nSELECTING HEALTHFUL FOODS\nPLUS TWO WEEKS OF MENUS\nevening meal.  Healthful snacks can be part of your meal\nplan as well.  Going for long periods without eating can\naffect how you feel and how much you eat.  Use the Food\nEAT BREAKFAST\nWhether at home or away, start your day with breakfast.\n“Breaking the fast” provides your body with both nutrients\nand energy.  People who eat breakfast tend to have more\nenergy and, on average, are better able to regulate their\nappetite during the remainder of the day than their break-\nfast-skipping counterparts.\nUnfortunately, many Americans do not eat breakfast.\nSome skip breakfast because of their schedule, whereas others\ndo so in a misguided attempt to control weight.  However,\nyou can eat a healthful breakfast with the time you have.\nThere are many ways to make what is perhaps the day's most\nimportant meal a nutritious, fast, and convenient one.\nBuild a Better Breakfast\nBreakfast is the foundation of a healthful diet.  Use the\nFood Guide Pyramid as a practical resource for planning\nyour breakfasts regardless of whether you choose foods that\nrequire preparation or select ones that are ready-to-go.\nCereals are a good choice.  Simple whole-grain cereals with\nno added sugar or fat are best (see sidebar:  Cold Breakfast\nCereals, this page).  A breakfast that includes a whole-grain\ncereal, bread, low-fat milk, and a glass of orange juice is a\ngreat starter meal.  This breakfast supplies B vitamins, fiber,\niron, approximately one-third of the recommended calcium,\nand 100 percent of the recommended vitamin C for the day.\nBest of all, it does so in less than 300 calories.\nFor a change, try a breakfast bagel sandwich.  Top a\nwhole-grain bagel with 2 teaspoons of peanut butter and a\nsliced banana.  Add a cup of cold skim milk for a breakfast\nthat is about 400 calories.  This breakfast includes foods\nfrom most of the food groups, is low in cholesterol, and is\na good source of iron, folate, and fiber.  For even more\nvariety, top a flour tortilla with 2 ounces of leftover chicken\nbreast and tomato pieces and 1 ounce of low-fat cheese.\nAs a vegetarian option, top with rice and beans.  Wrap the\ntortilla tightly, microwave for a minute or so, and top with\nsalsa.  While you are at it, drink a glass of a spicy vegetable\njuice.  Both of these quick-fix breakfasts contribute servings\nfrom the vegetable, fruit, and grain groups in just 350\ncalories.  They also give you plenty of vitamins A and C.\nMaybe you prefer eggs for breakfast.  The current rec-\nommendation is to limit your intake of whole eggs to 3 or\n4 per week.  The reason to limit eggs is that the yolk of a\nlarge-sized egg  contains  about 210 milligrams of choles-\nterol—more than two-thirds of the daily cholesterol\nallowance.  However, eggs also have many nutrients.  People\nwith a low blood cholesterol level probably can safely eat a\nfew more eggs than those who have a high level.  \nCreate an omelet with 1 whole egg plus 2 egg whites,\nsweet peppers, and onions.  Serve with oven-browned\npotatoes and a slice of whole-grain toast topped lightly\nwith butter or margarine.  Or, better yet, top with jam or\njelly as a no-fat alternative.  Remember to include fruit\nor juice.  This 500-calorie meal—although it contains\ncholesterol—is a good source of iron and is high in fiber,\nfolate, and vitamin C.\nBreakfast Out\nMany people are too busy to sit down and eat breakfast at\nhome.  The next best bet is to eat breakfast on-the-run,\n80\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nBRANDS\nCALORIES\nFAT\nFIBER\nSUGAR\n(1 CUP SERVING)\n(GRAMS) (GRAMS) (GRAMS)\nAll-Bran\n160\n2\n20\n12\nCracklin’ Oat Bran\n150\n8\n8\n20\nFiber One\n120\n2\n26\n0\nGranola\n450\n17\n6\n32\nGrape-Nuts\n400\n2\n10\n14\nRaisin Bran\n200\n1\n8\n18\nShredded Wheat\n(1 cup or 2 biscuits)\n170\n0\n5\n0\nWheaties\n110\n1\n3\n4\nWhole Grain Total\n150\n1\n4\n7\n*Most breakfast cereals are\nfortified to provide about \n25 percent of most daily\nnutrients.

Be sure to\nread the label.*  Choose those that are higher in fiber (more\nthan 3 grams/serving) and lower in calories, fat, and sugar.\nIngredients are listed in amounts by weight.  Check for\nhydrogenated fats.  If hydrogenated fat is listed near the\nbeginning of the list of ingredients, the product contains trans\nand saturated fats, which can increase blood cholesterol levels.\nwhich at times can pose a nutritional challenge.  Fortunately,\nif you know what you are looking for, a nutritious breakfast\ncan be found almost anywhere food is served.  If you are\ntraveling and have time for a “sit-down” breakfast, choose a\nrestaurant that offers a varied menu.  If not, try bagel shops,\nfast-food establishments, the company cafeteria, or even a\nnearby vending machine.  Some may have a “buffet break-\nfast” that has everything you need, including hot and cold\ncereals, breads, bagels, fresh fruit and fruit juices, low-fat\nmilk, and yogurt.  Others also may offer options such as\nlow-fat burritos, low-fat granola, or low-fat muffins.  (See\nsidebar: Best Bets When Eating Breakfast Out, below.)\nWHAT’S FOR LUNCH?\nThe midday meal is the meal most often eaten away from\nhome.  Your options include bringing a lunch from home\nor purchasing foods in a cafeteria, vending machine, or\nlocal delicatessen.\nThe same rules apply for “eating well” at lunch:  plan to\neat foods low in saturated fat and high in nutrients.  This\nmidday meal helps you meet your goal of 5 fruits and veg-\netables every day, and it is the perfect time to include whole\ngrains.  Lunch helps you to distribute your intake of calories\nand nutrients evenly throughout the day.  It can keep energy\nlevels high and help prevent unplanned snacking on foods\nthat may not be the best choices.\nBrown Bagging \nBringing a lunch to work can save you money and help\nyou eat what you really want to eat.  To be sure that your\nlunch tastes good and is good for you, try to incorporate\neach of the food groups in your lunch.  If you bring too\nlittle food, you will likely be hungry later in the day.  You\nthen increase the chance that you will snack before supper\nor eat too much at supper.\nTo keep brown-bag fare interesting and healthful, pack\nmore variety.  Think of the options:\nGrains—Instead of the usual sandwich bread, try pita\n(pocket) bread, tortilla wraps, crackers, pretzels, or rice\ncakes.  Or, try salads made with nutritious grains.  \nFruits—Include fresh fruits.  Every now and then,\nchoose an “exotic” fruit to add interest.  Try star fruit, kiwi,\npapaya, mango, or passion fruit.  (See Part II, Fruits, page\n153.)  Fruit juices can be nutritious and refreshing.\nVegetables—Expand your repertoire from raw carrots\nand celery sticks to potentially more satisfying vegetable\nsoups and salads.  Stuff pocket bread with a variety of\ncooked vegetables.  Use vegetables to make your sandwich\nmore filling:  fresh spinach or romaine, and slices of cucum-\nber, tomato, mushrooms, and sweet or chili peppers.  A\nvegetable juice makes a great lunchtime drink.\nDairy—Some days drink milk.  Other days eat yogurt\nor a bit of cheese.  Choose the low-fat forms more fre-\nquently to be sure your meal is rich in nutrients and not fat\nand calories.\nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n81\nCHOOSE THESE\nBEST BETS WHEN EATING BREAKFAST OUT\nINSTEAD OF THESE\nCALORIES\nFAT (GRAMS)\nCALORIES\nFAT (GRAMS)\nToast (2 slices)\n150\n2\nDoughnut (1) \n250\n12\nEnglish muffin (1) \n135\n1\nBran muffin (1 medium)\n360\n10\nBagel (1 half) \n150\n1\nCroissant (1 small)\n230\n12\nHard roll (1) \n100\n1\nSweet roll (1 small)\n350\n15\nCold cereal, bran type (1/2 cup) \n160\n2\nGranola (1/2 cup)\n250\n10\n4-inch pancake, plain (1) \n74\n1\nHash browns (1/2 cup)\n170\n9\nEgg substitute (1/4 cup) \n30\n0\nScrambled egg (1)\n100\n7\nMeat — Meat (which includes poultry, fish, and also\nbeans, legumes, and nuts) is good for you, but remember\nthat “moderation” is the key word.  To help take meat off\ncenter stage, be sure that you also include plenty of fruits,\nvegetables, and grains in your lunch.  Eat only lean meats.\nWhen possible, instead of meat, try to substitute foods\nsuch as hummus, lentils, beans, tofu, and nut spreads,\nwhich contain large amounts of plant protein (see sidebar:\nSandwich Fixings, below).\nVary the temperature of your lunch by including both\nhot and cold items.  A thermos will preserve heat more\neffectively if you first rinse it with hot water.  Likewise,\nrinsing with cold water will help keep foods cold longer.  If\nyour workplace does not have a refrigerator, a thermal\nlunch bag can help keep your food fresh and safe.  A frozen\nbox of juice can help keep your lunch cold, and the juice\nwill thaw by lunchtime.\nGoing Out for Lunch?\nIf you know what you are doing, eating lunch out increases\nyour options rather than your temptations.  Most fast-food\nrestaurants, eager to please the ever-growing number of\npeople who insist on eating more nutritious foods, now\noffer “lighter” fare such as salads and chicken.  But be careful\nthat you don’t choose foods that are healthful in name only.\nMany foods that at first glance seem to be good choices in\nfact are loaded with fat and calories.\nSalad Savvy\nSimple salads are best.  To construct a nutritious salad,\nincorporate lots of fresh vegetables and fruits.  Remember\nthat the word “salad” is not synonymous with “healthful.”\nTry to eat salads that are low in calories and fat but high in\nmuch-needed nutrients (see sidebar:  Salad Fixings, page 83).\nMany taco salads contain at least 900 calories, more than\nhalf of which comes from fat.  High-fat meats and cheeses\nheaped on a chef salad can dominate the vegetables.\nChicken and seafood are low in fat; however, this advantage\nis lost when they are covered with high-fat dressings and oils.\nMany of today’s salad bars look like delicatessens.  Pasta\nsalad, potato salad, guacamole, and tortellini are popular\nitems.  Depending on how they are made, they too can be\nhigh in fat and calories.\nUnless used sparingly, some dressings can provide up to\n400 calories to your salad.

Stick with lean meat without\nmayonnaise or cheese.  If salt is not a concern, ketchup or\nmustard adds very few calories.  Request extra lettuce or top-\npings such as tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, or sweet peppers.  \nSNACK TIME\nCarefully chosen, snacks can be healthful and nutritious.\nCheck out the options.  Look for “food machines” stocked\nwith fresh fruit, juices, cut-up vegetables or mini-salads,\nnonfat or low-fat milk, yogurt, cereals, or small bagels.\nSnack items such as pretzels or baked chips, although high\nin salt, are relatively low in calories.  Negotiate with your\ncoworkers:  instead of doughnuts and sweet rolls (which can\nprovide about 250 calories and up to 15 grams of saturated\nfat), offer to bring fresh fruits, vegetables, mini-sized bagels,\nor bread with a low-fat cream cheese.

Unfortunately, a leisurely\nsupper usually gives way to evening demands such as a\nschool meeting, a child’s soccer game, or your own “home\nwork.”  Sometimes the very thought of preparing a nutri-\ntious supper seems overwhelming after a hectic day.\nHowever, with a little planning, you can still eat well.\nMake Time for the Evening Meal\nIf possible, make time for supper.  The evening meal is\noften the main meal of the day.  It therefore can go a long\nway to ensure that you get all of your daily nutrient require-\nments.  In addition, a satisfying supper decreases your\nchances of eating an unplanned after-supper snack.\nEnticing Evening Meals\nTry to incorporate food from each food group into your\nevening meal.  Make an effort to eat more plant-based\nfoods.  These nicely complement smaller servings of lean\nmeats and low-fat dairy products.  Try cuisine from other\nparts of the world—particularly those that feature grains,\nvegetables, and fruits as the centerpiece of the meal.  Make\nyour meals interesting by varying the colors, textures, and\nshapes of foods.  You do not have to be a great chef to give\nsupper the visual appeal that everyone wants to eat.  Fruits\nand vegetables add color and all the vitamins, minerals,\nand fiber your body needs.\nBreads come in a broad variety of shapes and textures—\nfrom long, thin French baguettes to braided challah bread\nto the blackest of pumpernickels.  The same goes for pasta.\nIn addition to your usual favorites, try whole-wheat spaghetti,\nfarfalle (bow-tie), fusilli (little springs), orzo (rice-shaped),\nor ziti (large tubes).

Instead of plain white rice,\ntry basmati, jasmine rice, or nutrient-rich brown rice.  Wild\nrice (not really a “rice” but a seed from a type of grass) adds\nboth crunch and a nutty flavor to a meal.\nInstead of red meat, eat fish and poultry more often.\nSeafood cases are stocked with a wide variety of fish fillets\nand “steaks” from around the world.  In addition to domes-\ntic chicken or turkey, poultry choices include wild game\nbirds and small “hens.”   When you choose a red meat, eat\na lean cut and vary the seasonings.  Try to have some meat-\nless meals.  A supper containing legumes, beans, and other\nvegetarian fare is high in protein and low in saturated fat.\nTop off the evening meal with fresh fruit and a selection\nof low-fat cheese, a fresh whole-grain cake, frozen low-fat\nyogurt, ice cream, or sherbet.  A fine wine, a cup of café au\nlait, and a delicious dessert, if part of the day’s meal plan, can\nnicely complement a well-prepared and well-presented meal.\nMake It Quick\nEvening meals can be quick and yet still contain the fresh-\nest of ingredients.  Keep in mind that fruits and vegeta-\nbles are tasty, nutritious, and easy to prepare.  Quick but\nhealthful suppers can be made from carefully selected dried,\ncanned, frozen, or bottled foods.  Plan to eat leftovers at times\nwhen you know you won’t have time to cook.  Cooking more\nwhen you are able, freezing a portion or two, and having it\non hand when time is tight all can help you avoid skipping\nsupper or grabbing something that you know you should\nnot eat.\nDining Out\nEating out is an American passion.  In fact, Americans\nspend almost half their food dollars in restaurants.  With\nthe wide array of restaurants that are available in most com-\nmunities, dining out should be a pleasure rather than a\nthreat to your resolve to eat well.\nListed here are five points to remember when you eat out.\nThink of these as five tips for eating well when eating out.  \nChoose restaurants that help you achieve your daily 5\nor more servings of fruits and vegetables\nChoose restaurants that offer a wide selection of fruits and\nvegetables.  Look for fruit and vegetable selections in the\nappetizer, entrée, and dessert menus which are prepared\nwithout added fat.  Choose ethnic and vegetarian restau-\nrants that feature grain- and vegetable-based meals.  \nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n85\nLower the fat in four ways\nWhen ordering, consider these four methods to lower the\namount of fat in your meals:\nCooking method—If the menu item is described as fried\nor sautéed, ask that it be baked or broiled.  This simple\nrequest can save 10 to 30 grams of fat and about 100 to 300\nunwanted calories.\n“On the side”—Ask for the sauce, condiment, salad\ndressing, or topping to be put “on the side.”  If a dish is pre-\npared with a high-fat sauce (such as Alfredo, cream sauce,\ncheese, or gravy), request that it be placed on the side or ask\nfor a lower-fat alternative such as a marinara sauce.  Other\nhigh-fat condiments and toppings (such as butter or sour\ncream) should also be on the side so you can control how\nmuch you use.\nServing size—Bigger is not necessarily better, especially\nwhen it comes to calories, fat, and your health.  Terms such\nas “mammoth,” “deluxe,” and “hearty” are your tip-offs.\nOrder smaller portions.  Ask for a “take-home” container,\nor plan to share your meal with your dinner companion so\nyou do not feel obligated to eat it all.  \nSubstitute lower-fat choices—Make sure that your meal\nhas plenty of grains, vegetables, and fruits.  Take meat away\nfrom center stage by starting with a tossed salad.  Ask for\nextra steamed vegetables.  The bread basket generally offers\na whole-grain choice.  Don’t forget to finish the meal with\nfresh fruit, sherbet, or sorbet and a glass of low-fat milk.  Try\nto avoid the high-fat, calorie-rich desserts that you will\nlater wish you had not eaten.\nLimit meat to 3 ounces per serving (or no more than \n6 ounces per day)\nHealth experts agree that Americans eat too much meat\n(including poultry and fish), especially in light of the fact\nthat our bodies need only a relatively small amount of\nprotein.  Large portions of meat almost invariably contribute\nexcess calories, fat, and cholesterol to the meal.  A 3-ounce\nportion is about the size of a deck of cards.  Whenever you\neat meat, poultry, or fish, try to be sure that you eat a total\nof only 6 ounces per day (see sidebar:  “Cut” Your Portions\nof Meat, this page).\nLimit alcohol to 2 drinks (1 if you are a woman)\nMost authorities suggest that alcohol be limited to 2 drinks\nper day if you are a man, 1 drink per day if you are a woman.\nAll alcohol-containing drinks contain calories (see sidebar:\nA Drink Defined..., page 87).\nMake eating well your number 1 priority\nRestaurants are in the business of satisfying their customers.\nAsk your server to recommend the most healthful foods\nthe kitchen can prepare.  Do not rely on “heart-healthy”\nsymbols on the menu.  These foods may be low in choles-\nterol, but they still may be high in total fat, saturated fat,\nand calories.  Feel free to request low-fat foods or that more\nvegetables and fruits be added to your meal.  Ask your\nserver to clarify unfamiliar terms and to answer any of\nyour questions.\nEthnic Cuisine:  Your Passport \nto Healthful Meals\nEthnic restaurants and grocery stores offer a wide variety of\nculinary alternatives.  Often, ethnic cuisines are plant-\nbased, and thus many people assume they are healthful.\nHowever, that is not always the case.  Some guidelines\nbelow, in addition to the suggestions previously mentioned,\nwill help you to savor the exotic flavors while keeping\ncalories, fat, cholesterol, and sodium under control.  \nAsian cuisine features rice, noodles, and vegetables with\nlittle or no meat.  However, it may not be as healthful as one\nbelieves.  For example, fried rice is just what it says—fried.\nTherefore, white rice or, even better, brown rice would be\na healthier option.  If you are dining at an Asian restaurant,\nmake sure to request that little oil be used in preparation,\n86\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\n8-OUNCE\n3-OUNCE\nPORTION\nPORTION\nCALORIES\nFAT\nCALORIES\nFAT\n(GRAMS)\n(GRAMS)\nPrime rib of beef\n960\n83\n360\n31\nLamb chop\n775\n66\n298\n25\nSirloin beef steak\n745\n59\n280\n22\nPork chop\n454\n20\n175\n8\nRoasted chicken \nbreast (with-\nout skin)\n380\n8\n145\n3\nBroiled fish\n240\n2\n90\nTrace\n“CUT” YOUR PORTIONS OF MEAT\nNote the savings in calories and fat with smaller portions of meat.\nand if your portion is large, split it with someone.  Stir-\nfry, grilled meat, or chicken skewers are healthful choices.\nTo decrease sodium, limit foods with soy sauce, salt, and\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG).\nMany staples of the Middle Eastern, Indian, and\nPakistani cuisines are low-fat, low-sodium items such as\npita bread, rice, couscous, and lentils.  However, keep in\nmind that these foods often are combined with large\namounts of butter, coconut oil, or palm oil.  Request foods\nwithout the added fats and that sauces be put on the side.\nHealthful selections include kabobs or fish that is grilled, rice,\ncouscous, or orzo.\nGreek and Mediterranean food is based on pasta, bread,\nand rice.  It is often the sauce that accompanies the grain\nthat adds calories and fat.  Sauces to watch out for include\npesto and cream-based sauces.  Red sauces are usually quite\nlow in calories and fat.  If ordering a pizza, remember that\nthe meat and cheese are the culprits for calories and fat.\nOrder a pizza with one meat item at the most, request half\nthe cheese, and load on the vegetables.\nFinally, Caribbean, Mexican, and Central and South\nAmerican cuisine includes whole grains, corn, rice, flour\ntortillas, beans (pinto, red, black), and salsa.

Never drink and drive.\nare an issue, so be sure to request less cheese, and have sour\ncream and guacamole on the side.  Grilled fish and chicken\nare best bets as main courses.  Fresh vegetables and fruits\naccompany most meals.\nGROCERY SHOPPING:\nANOTHER KEY TO HEALTHFUL MEALS\nWhen it comes to eating at home, your meals can only be\nas good as the food you have in your kitchen.  Stock your\nkitchen with foods that help you eat well.  Be sure you\nhave plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains on hand\nso you translate your plan for healthful eating into enjoy-\nable and nutritious meals.\nMake a List\nMake a grocery list.  A mental list may work, but a struc-\ntured plan generally is more effective.  A written list helps\nensure that you select the ingredients and foods that you\nwant rather than things you select on impulse.  A checklist\nalso can save time by avoiding the need to come back to pick\nup forgotten items.\nAt the Store\nMost Americans make one or more trips to the grocery\nstore every week.  Some people consider grocery shopping\na form of entertainment, but others regard it as a chore.  No\nmatter how you feel about shopping, a few strategies can\nmake your investment of time worthwhile.\nShop the perimeter—The freshest foods generally are\nlocated along the perimeter of the store.  These include\nfresh fruits, vegetables, breads, dairy products, and meats.\nChoose whole-grain breads from the bakery, low-fat products\nfrom the dairy section, and lean cuts from the meat section.\nHigher-fat foods often are stocked in the interior of the\nstore.  However, grains, legumes, pastas, and canned fruits\nand vegetables also are frequently located in the interior.\nShop from your list—A list helps ensure that you stick\nto your plan.  Items purchased on impulse generally are\nmore expensive and less nourishing than foods from a well-\nplanned shopping list.\nDo not shop when hungry—If you go to the store\nwith a growling stomach, you are apt to make purchases to\nsatisfy your immediate hunger rather than what you will\nneed in the days ahead.  You also tend to buy more.\nShopping on a full stomach helps you stick to your list and\nto keep your resolve.\nMake bargains count—A bargain is only a bargain\nwhen you buy what you want rather than what someone else\nis trying to sell you.  Select bargains that fit your menu, such\nas in-season fruits and vegetables or bulk quantities of rice,\nbeans, and legumes.  Use coupons to reduce the cost of\nfoods that you intend to buy.  \nLabel Smarts\nUnderstanding food labels helps you become a savvy shop-\nper.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established\nrequirements for food labels in order to make nutrition\ninformation accurate, clear, consistent, and useful to con-\nsumers.  Food labels provide four different types of infor-\nmation:  nutrition facts, a list of ingredients, nutrients,\nand health claims.\nNutrient facts and ingredients\nLabels tell you almost everything you need to know about\nwhat is contained in the food.  The Nutrition Facts panel\ntells you how many calories and how much fat, choles-\nterol, protein, and carbohydrate are in a single serving of the\nfood.  It also tells you the fiber, vitamin (A and C), and\nmineral (sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron) contents\nof the food.  This information allows you to compare the\nnutrients found in similar foods.  For example, you can\ncompare two yogurts for their calorie and fat content.\nIngredients are listed in descending order by weight, with\nthe first item listed being the predominant one in the food.\nBy reading the label, you can tell which foods have added\n88\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nUse labels to compare similar foods\nand to make the healthiest choices.\nsaturated fats or  ingredients to which you may be intolerant.\nUse the label to select the best choices—foods  that are\nhigh in nutrients and low in calories and fat.\nTo help you make the wisest choices, acquaint yourself\nwith each of the components of the label (see sidebar:\nAnatomy of a Food Label, below).  Some foods, such as\nfresh fruits, vegetables, and bulk items, do not have nutrition\nlabels.  The nutrition information for these foods generally\neither is on display nearby or is available elsewhere in the\nstore as a handout.  When in doubt, ask the store personnel\nfor assistance.\nNutrient and health claims\nIn addition to the amounts of various nutrients and ingre-\ndients found in foods, food labels may carry other types\nof information.  The label may state that the food is a “good\nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n89\nANATOMY OF A FOOD LABEL\nAt first glance, a food label may look intimidating.  But as you become familiar \nwith the format, you’ll see how the label can help you compare products for nutritional quality.\nSERVING SIZE:\nNutrition information\nis based on consistent\nand realistic serving\nsizes that include \nboth household and\nmetric measures.  \nThis makes it easier \nto compare products.\nCALORIES FROM FAT:\nThis information\nunderscores the fat\ncontent per serving\nof foods to help you\nmeet the recom-\nmendation of no\nmore than 30 percent\nof calories from fat.\nRemember, it’s your\ntotal fat intake over \na period of time\n(such as 24 hours),\nand not the amount\nin one food or meal,\nthat’s important.\nPERCENT DAILY VALUE:\nThe percent daily\nvalues show the\npercentage of a \nnutrient that is \nprovided by this \nproduct serving, \nbased on a 2,000-\ncalorie diet.  Use \nthe percent daily \nvalue figures to\ncompare products \neasily and to tell\nwhether a food \nis high or low \nin nutrients.\nNUTRIENTS:\nAt a minimum, all\ncalories, calories\nfrom fat, total fat,\nsaturated fat, choles-\nterol, sodium, total\ncarbohydrate, dietary\nfiber, sugars, protein,\nvitamins A and C,\ncalcium, and iron\nare listed.  Experts\nbelieve that too much\nor too little of these\nnutrients has the\ngreatest impact on\nyour health.\nCALORIES PER GRAM:\nThis shows the calorie\ncontent of the energy-\nproducing nutrients.\nNutrition Facts\nServing size 1/2 cup (114 g)\nServings per container 4\nAmount per serving\nCalories 90\nCalories from fat 30\nPercent Daily Value*\nTotal fat 3 g\n5%\nSaturated fat 0 g\n0%\nCholesterol 0 mg\n0%\nSodium 300 mg\n13%\nTotal carbohydrate 13 g\n4%\nDietary fiber 3 g\n12%\nSugars 3 g\nProtein 3 g\nVitamin A\n80%\nVitamin C\n60%\nCalcium\n4%\nIron\n4%\n*Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet.

Nutrient claims help guide you\nmore quickly to certain products.  Products also may claim\nthat they benefit certain health conditions.  Health claims\nmay suggest that eating a food alters your risk for certain\ndiseases such as heart disease, cancer, or osteoporosis.  The\ngovernment regulates these claims so they are truthful and\nmeet certain criteria.  Manufacturers are not required by law\nto carry nutrient or health claims.  (See sidebars:  Nutrient\nClaims, page 92, and Health Claims, page 93.)\nFOODS AND ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE\nWONDERED ABOUT\nFarming methods are rapidly evolving.  New foods and\nnovel ingredients are continuously being introduced into the\nmarketplace.  Pesticides and fertilizers are used to increase\nyields.  Genetic engineering potentially can produce safer,\nmore nutritious, and cheaper forms of foods.  Substitutes\n(such as sugar, fat, and salt substitutes) enable some people\nto eat foods that would otherwise endanger their health.\nHowever, not everyone would agree that these changes are\nan advance because many have been accompanied by uncer-\ntainty and, in some instances, controversy.  What about\nadditives?  Organic foods?  Irradiated foods?  What does it\nmean when a food is enriched or fortified?  Read on.\nWhat About Pesticides?\nPesticides and modern pest management practices have\nhelped to ensure that we have a reliable, affordable, varied,\nnutritious, and safe food supply.  Pesticides are chemicals\nthat kill or prevent the growth of weeds (herbicides), bac-\nteria (disinfectants and antibiotics), molds and fungi (fungi-\ncides), and harmful insects (insecticides).  Some pesticides\noccur naturally in soil, whereas others are found in com-\npounds isolated from particular plants.  Many farmers try\nto control pests in the most effective, least disruptive manner\nby practicing what is known as integrated pest manage-\nment.  This approach includes companion planting with\nplants that contain natural pesticides, crop rotation, use\nof sterile strains of insects or insect pheromones (to alter\nreproduction patterns and thereby reduce the insect pop-\nulation), natural insect predators, pest-resistant plant strains,\nmathematical forecasting techniques, and, when necessary,\nchemical pesticides.\nShould you worry about pesticide residues?  The answer\nis a qualified “no.”  The upper limit of the amount of pesticide\nresidue permitted on both raw and processed foods has\nbeen carefully established and is enforced by several gov-\nernment agencies.  These upper limits are far less than the\nlevels of exposure that are considered harmful.  However,\nto reduce your exposure to pesticide residues further, you\ncan take the following steps:\n• Carefully select the produce you buy (avoid cuts, holes,\nor signs of decay).\n• Thoroughly wash all produce with water (not soap)\nto remove surface residues.\n• Scrub carrots and potatoes and other root vegetables\nthoroughly.  Wash other fresh fruits and vegetables\nwith a brush.  Resist the temptation to peel apples,\npears, cucumbers, potatoes, and other produce with\nedible skin, because peeling removes a valuable source\nof fiber.\n• Remove the outer leaves (and any inner leaves that\nappear to be damaged) from leafy vegetables such as\nlettuce and cabbage.\n• Eat a variety of foods rather than large amounts of a\nsingle food.\nWhat About Food Additives?\nContrary to what many of us think, food additives have\nbeen used for centuries (and until the past 100 or so years,\nwithout much regard for health considerations).  Additives\nplay various roles in foods.  Some additives act as preserv-\natives, preventing spoilage, loss of flavor, texture, or nutri-\ntive value.  These include antioxidants such as vitamin E,\nBHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), BHT (butylated hydroxy-\ntoluene), citric acid, and sulfites; calcium propionate; sodi-\num nitrite (which prevents infection by the dangerous\nbacteria that causes botulism); and other antimicrobials\n(germ-fighting additives).  Other additives are used as\nemulsifiers to prevent foods from separating.  Emulsifiers\ninclude lecithin from soy, egg yolks, or milk and mono-\nglycerides and diglycerides.  The leavening agents sodium\nbicarbonate (baking soda and powder) and yeast allow\nbaked goods to rise.  Stabilizers and thickeners create and\nmaintain an even texture and flavor in foods such as ice\ncream and pudding.  Many foods are also fortified or\nenriched with vitamins, minerals, or proteins or their com-\nponent amino acids (see page 25).\nThe government strictly regulates food additives.  The\nsafety and effectiveness of each newly proposed additive\nmust be rigorously tested.  Some 700 additives belong to\na group of substances referred to as GRAS substances\n(Generally Recognized As Safe) because\nextensive testing and use have shown no evi-\ndence of adverse effects.  Continued approval\nrequires that all additives, including GRAS\nsubstances, must be reevaluated regularly with\nthe latest scientific methods.  According to\nlaw, additives and preservatives must be list-\ned on food labels.  People who are sensitive\nto certain additives such as sulfites or mono-\nsodium glutamate should be sure to read\nlabels for additive information.\nOrganic Foods:  \nAre They Really Better?\nIf pesticides and food additives pose any\npotential risk at all, would we be better off\neating only “organically grown” foods?  What\nis an organic food?  Organic farming methods\nare those that use only nonsynthetic products\n(substances that are naturally found in the\nenvironment).\nCan you be sure that the organic products you buy are\nreally grown and produced organically?  In 1998, Congress\nenacted the Organic Foods Production Act, which regulates\nproduction and processing standards for organic foods.\nThis act specifies that foods sold as “organically grown” or\n“organically processed” must be certified by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture.  However, organically pro-\nduced foods may not be 100 percent organic.  By law, they\nmust have at least 50 percent of their ingredients produced\nnaturally, and organically processed foods must contain at\nleast 95 percent organically produced ingredients.  \nAre these foods better?  Not necessarily.  Nutritionally,\norganically grown foods may not be significantly different\nfrom the same products grown with conventional farming\ntechniques.  The nutrient content of a product is determined\nby many factors, including the composition of the soil, the\ngenetic makeup of the plant, the degree of maturity at\nharvest, and methods of handling after harvest.  The taste\nof organic products may or may not differ from that of\nconventionally grown foods.  Organic methods tend to be\nmore costly (in terms of both labor and materials),\nproduction is lower, and consumer prices tend to be high-\ner.  In addition, organic methods are not always safer.  Some\npesticides reduce the risk of exposure to certain harmful\norganisms that represent a much greater potential risk than\ndoes exposure to the pesticide.  In most instances, personal\npreference rather then proven benefit determines whether\nyou choose to eat an organic food.  \nWhat About Irradiated Foods?\nUntil the 1800s, soaking in salt and natural fermentation\nwere the most commonly used methods for food preservation.\nThis changed with the introduction of canning in the 1800s.\nPasteurization began to be used in the late 1800s to kill harm-\nful bacteria, freezing in the early 1900s to extend the shelf\nlife of foods, and freeze drying in the 1960s to preserve foods.  \nFood is irradiated when it is passed through a beam of\nradiant energy.  Irradiated foods are not radioactive.\nIrradiation does not diminish the importance of safe food\nhandling (see Chapter 5, Food Safety, page 148), nor does\nit improve the quality of food.  However, irra-\ndiation can extend the shelf life, reduce\nfood wastage, and reduce food prices.\nMost importantly, irradiation can\ndestroy bacteria that cause food-\nborne illness.  Food irradiation is\nstrictly controlled by the Food and\nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n91\nGovernment regulations require irradiated food at the retail\nlevel to be labeled \"Treated with Radiation\" or \"Treated by\nIrradiation\" and to bear this international logo, the radura. \nDrug Administration (FDA).  All irradiated foods carry a\nsymbol and the phrase “Treated by Irradiation.”  However,\nwhen irradiated foods are used  in a restaurant, they are not\nrequired to be labeled.\nWhat About Genetically Engineered Foods?\nModern genetic-engineering techniques are a refinement of\ntraditional plant-breeding methods.  Genetic engineers\nfirst select a desired plant  trait.  They then isolate and\nmodify the gene(s) responsible for the trait.  Finally, they\nattempt to introduce the altered gene into other plants.\nIn essence, genetic engineering accelerates the natural mix-\ning of genes that normally would occur among various\nplant species.\nGenetic engineering of plants has yielded several\nbenefits.  Farmers can protect crops against weeds with\ngenetically engineered biodegradable herbicides that need\nfewer applications.  Genetic engineering also can extend the\ntime before spoilage begins, enabling growers to harvest\nfoods closer to peak freshness.  Crops can be genetically\nengineered to be drought- and temperature-resistant.\nGenetic engineering can increase crop yields and enable\nplants to tolerate a wider range of climates.  Genetic engi-\nneering also can increase the amount and quality of protein\nin beans and in grains such as rice.\nAlthough there are benefits associated with genetically\nengineered foods, there also are lingering questions about\nthe long-term effects on the environment and the ability\nof producers and the government to ensure the safety of\nthe process. Therefore, the debate continues regarding\nhow genetically engineered foods should be developed and\nregulated.\nWhat Do the Terms “Fortified” and\n“Enriched” Mean?\nDo you know the difference between the terms “fortified”\nand “enriched”?  Both words indicate that nutrients have\nbeen added to the food.  Fortified means that nutrients\nwere added that were not there originally.  Enriched means\nthat nutrients lost during processing are replaced.  Fortified\nand enriched foods have helped eliminate many once-\ncommon nutritional deficiency diseases.\nSalt was the first commercial food item in the United\nStates to be fortified with additional nutrients.  Since 1924,\npotassium iodide has been added to table salt to help prevent\ngoiter (an enlarged thyroid that may result from iodine\ndeficiency).\n92\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nTERM\nPER SERVING SIZE ON LABEL\nFree\nContains no, or only “physiologically or\ninconsequential” amounts of, fat, satu-\nrated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sugars,\nand calories\nReduced\nAt least 25 percent lower in the nutrient\nthan the standard product\nLite, light\nAt least 50 percent less fat\n50 percent less sodium; one-third fewer\ncalories (must also contain less than \n50 percent of calories from fat)\nLow\nLow fat:  3 grams or less \nLow cholesterol:  20 milligrams or less\nLow saturated fat:  1 gram or less \nLow sodium:  140 milligrams or less\nVery low sodium:  35 milligrams or less\nLow calorie:  40 calories or less\nHigh\n20 percent or more of the Daily Value\nFiber:  5 grams or more\nPotassium:  700 milligrams or more\nVitamin A:  1,000 IU or more\nVitamin C:  12 milligrams or more\nFolate:  80 micrograms or more\nIron:  3.6 milligrams or more\nGood source\n10 to 19 percent of the Daily Value\nFiber:  2.5 to less than 5 grams\nPotassium:  350 to less than 700 milligrams\nVitamin A:  500 to less than 1,000 IU\nVitamin C:  6 to less than 12 milligrams\nFolate:  40 to less than 80 micrograms\nIron:  1.8 to less than 3.6 milligrams\nHealthy\nFood that is low in fat and saturated fat,\n480 milligrams or less sodium, and at least\n10 percent Daily Value for vitamin A,\nvitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber\nLean\nLess than 10 grams total fat, 4.5 grams\nsaturated fat, and  95 milligrams choles-\nterol per 100 grams (about 3 ounces)\nExtra lean\nLess than 5 grams total fat, 2 grams satu-\nrated fat, and 95 milligrams cholesterol\nper 100 grams (about 3 ounces)\nNUTRIENT CLAIMS\nVitamin D was first added to milk in 1933.  Rickets, a\ndeforming bone disease, can result from too little vitamin\nD.  Rickets was very common during the early part of the\ncentury when working children were deprived of nutri-\ntious diets and sunlight.\nFlour, and products made with flour, were first fortified\nwith vitamins and iron in 1940 at the start of World War\nII.  The goal was to build strong, healthy armies by feeding\ntroops well-fortified diets.\nMost breakfast cereals are fortified to provide about 25\npercent of most daily nutrients.  Many of these vitamins\nmay dissolve into the milk that you pour over the cereal, so\nit is important to drink the milk at the bottom of the bowl.\n(Plus, milk itself provides its own nutrients.)\nMost recently, folic acid has joined the list of fortifiers\nadded to grain-based (bread, cereal, pasta, rice) foods to\nhelp meet nutrient needs and to reduce the incidence of\nbirth defects and possibly the risk of heart disease.\nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n93\nDISEASE/NUTRIENT OR FOOD\nEXAMPLE OF A HEALTH CLAIM\nOsteoporosis/calcium\nRegular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium help teens and\nyoung adult white and Asian women maintain good bone health and may\nreduce their high risk of osteoporosis later in life.\nCancer/fat\nDevelopment of cancer depends on many factors.  A diet low in total fat\nmay reduce the risk of some cancers.\nCancer/fiber-containing foods\nLow-fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables\nmay reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with\nmany factors.\nCancer/fruits and vegetables\nLow-fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and\nmay contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) may reduce the risk\nof some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors.  Broccoli\nis high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber.\nHeart disease/fiber-containing foods\nDiets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and rich in fruits, vegetables,\nand grain products which contain some types of dietary fiber, particularly\nsoluble fiber, may reduce the risk of heart disease, a disease associated\nwith many factors.\nHeart disease/saturated fat and cholesterol\nWhile many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and\ncholesterol may reduce the risk of this disease.\nHypertension/sodium\nDiets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease\nassociated with many factors.\nBirth defects/folic acid\nHealthful diets with adequate folate may reduce a woman’s risk of having\na child with a brain or spinal cord defect.\nHEALTH CLAIMS\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strictly regulates health claims.  They must be supported by \nscientific evidence to appear on food labels.  The foods must also meet specific nutrient requirements.  \nBelow are several examples of FDA-approved health claims.\n94\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nChapter 4:  Planning Meals\n95\nTwo Weeks of Menus\nT\nhe following pages contain 14 days’ worth of nutritionally balanced menus. The menus emphasize whole grains,\nfresh fruits, and vegetables.  They are low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, moderate in sodium, and high \nin taste.  In addition, they are a great source of health-enhancing phytonutrients.  \nThe actual guidelines for the menus are listed below. \nThe serving sizes are based on the Food Guide Pyramid (see \nChapter 1, page 11). For each day, the breakdown of servings \nfrom the Food Guide Pyramid is provided.\nAccompanying each menu, there is one recipe.  Use these \nmenus as a guide to begin to eat a more nutritiously balanced \ndiet.  As needed, make adjustments to suit your needs.  If you \nneed additional (or fewer) calories, simply add or take away \na serving.

Recipe modification is one of the\nmore useful cooking skills.  In some instances, modification\nof the fat, sugar, or salt content actually can make the food\ntastier, moister, and more satisfying than it was originally.\nWhen Should a Recipe Be Modified?\nSometimes it is difficult to know whether a recipe can be\nadjusted without sacrificing taste, texture, and appeal.\nTry modifying a recipe if you answer “yes” to any of the\nfollowing questions:\n•  Is the recipe high in fat, sugar, or salt?\n•  Is this a food I eat frequently?\n•  Is this a food I eat in large amounts?\nKeep in mind that not every recipe needs to be modified.\nIf, for example, a certain high-fat dessert is a family favorite\nand it is prepared infrequently, there is no need to change\nit.  As long as it is treated as an item from the top of the\nFood Guide Pyramid (see Chapter 1, page\n11)—the occasional food—enjoy it in its\nfamiliar form.\nExperiment\nBecause every recipe is different,\nexperimentation is necessary.  There\nare numerous ways to make a recipe\nhealthier.  Of course, not every experi-\nment works.  It may take several attempts\nto achieve the desired taste and consistency.\nOnce the modified recipe meets your expec-\ntations, file it for future use.\nM\nuch has been learned about how to prepare healthful\nfoods that are enjoyable, convenient to make, and\neconomical.  Many of the leading chefs of Europe and the\nUnited States have abandoned cooking styles that once\ndepended on fats and oils and are now using healthier\ncooking methods.  This “new” cuisine uses the cook's culinary\nskill to create delicious meals that bring fruits, vegetables, and\ngrains to center stage.\nSimple yet innovative techniques can be used to modify\nfavorite recipes to maximize the nutritious value of the\nmeal without jeopardizing its taste.  When you modify an\nexisting recipe, it is generally best to start slowly, making one\nchange at a time.  Persistence, willingness to experiment, and\na few tried-and-true hints can help you prepare healthful\nand flavorful meals.\nCHANGE IS GOOD\nRecently, fat, sugar, and salt have been vilified for the roles\nthey play in increasing the risk of certain dis-\neases such as obesity, diabetes, coronary artery\ndisease, and high blood pressure.  However,\nthey are only “bad” when eaten in excess. The key\nis not to banish them from the kitchen but to\nuse them in moderation.\nFat provides flavor, substance,\nand a mouth-pleasing creamy\ntexture.  Sugar adds sweetness,\ncrispness, tenderness, and color.\nSalt heightens the flavor of foods\nand is necessary in baked goods\nmade with yeast.\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nr\n \nf\ni\nv\ne\nPREPARING\nHEALTHFUL MEALS\nAs a start, try these five methods:  \n• Reduce the amount of  fat, sugar, or salt.\n• Delete a high-fat ingredient or seasoning.\n• Substitute a healthier ingredient.\n• Change the method used to prepare the recipe.\n• Reduce the amount of meat in the recipe.\nCan the Amount of an Ingredient Be Reduced?\nStart by reducing the amount one ingredient at a time.  In\nmost baked goods, sugar generally can be reduced by one-\nthird to one-half without substantially changing consistency\nor taste.  Because sugar increases moisture, as a rule retain\none-fourth cup of sugar, honey, or molasses for every cup\nof flour in baked goods.  To maximize the sweetness of\nfoods, when appropriate, serve the dish warm or at room\ntemperature rather than cold.  In addition, there are spices\nthat can enhance sweetness.  Some possibilities include\ncinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and vanilla and almond\nextract or flavoring.  Eliminating a cup of sugar in a recipe\nsaves about 800 calories.\nFat also can be reduced by one-third to one-half in baked\ngoods.  Use puréed fruit or applesauce to replace the fat\nin a 1:1 ratio.  For example, use one-half cup of oil plus one-\nhalf cup of unsweetened applesauce (instead of 1 cup of oil).\nEliminating 1 cup of oil or fat saves about 2,000 calories and\n225 grams of fat.  Another way to decrease fat and cholesterol\nis to substitute egg whites or egg substitute for a whole egg.\nFor every egg, use 2 egg whites or a quarter cup of egg\nsubstitute.  With this replacement, approximately 5 grams\nof fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 200 milligrams of choles-\nterol, and 60 calories are saved.  \nReduce but do not totally remove salt because a small\namount of salt frequently is required to facilitate the chem-\nical reactions that occur during cooking. Salt is always\nrequired with yeast-leavened items.  The cooler the food,\nthe saltier it will taste.  Try under-salting hot foods that\nwill be chilled before serving.  Using a half teaspoon of salt\ninstead of 1 teaspoon in a recipe saves about 1,200 mil-\nligrams of sodium.  (See sidebar:  Tips for Using Spices\nand Herbs, this page.)\nCan an Ingredient Be Omitted?\nDetermine whether any ingredients can be omitted.  Sugar,\nfat, and salt are likely candidates because in many instances\nthey are used mainly for appearance or by habit.  To reduce\nsugar, omit candy coatings, sugary frostings, and syrups.\nNuts, although nutritious, are high in fat and contribute sig-\nnificant calories.  Additional condiments that add unwanted\nfat and calories include coconut, whipped cream, mayon-\nnaise, butter, margarine, and sour cream.  Pickles, catsup,\nolives, and mustard are low in calories.  However, because\nthese condiments are high in salt, persons who have high\nblood pressure or heart disease generally should limit their use.\nCan a Substitution Be Made?\nSubstituting ingredients that are lower in fat, sugar, and\nsalt can make a significant difference in a recipe.  For exam-\nple, use skim milk rather than whole or 2 percent milk.\nProducts made from pureed prunes and apples or mashed\nbananas often can be used as a replacement for butter,\nmargarine, or oil.  These products also can be used in\nhomemade baked goods or box mixes.  (See sidebar:\nChoose These Alternatives to Reduce Fat, Sugar, and Salt,\npage 127.)\nBe cautious when using fat-free spreads (such as fat-\nfree margarine or cream cheese), “artificial” sweeteners, or\nsalt substitutes in cooked foods.  Most fat-free spreads contain\na significant amount of water.  This can change the outcome\nof the recipe by affecting its leavening or by leaving the\nfood runny.  Some sweeteners (such as aspartame) lose\ntheir sweetness when exposed to heat.  Heat can make\nsome salt substitutes (such as those containing potassium\nchloride) strong or bitter tasting.  For these reasons, these\nproducts generally should be restricted to recipes that do not\nrequire cooking or are used as condiments when foods are\n126\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\n• Conversion:  1 tablespoon fresh herbs = 1 teaspoon dry\n= 1/4 teaspoon powdered\n• Use sparingly:  1/4 teaspoon per pound of meat or pint\nof sauce.  You can always add more.\n• When doubling a recipe, add only 50 percent more\nseasoning.\n• Crush or rub dry herbs between your fingers to\nenhance flavor before adding them to a recipe.\n• In long-cooking entrées such as stews, add herbs\ntoward the end of the cooking time.\n• In chilled foods such as dips, salads, and dressings, add\nherbs several hours before serving.\n• For maximal freshness, purchase herbs in small quantities\nand store in airtight containers away from light and heat.\nTIPS FOR USING SPICES AND HERBS\nserved at the table.  In most instances, success depends on\npatience and a bit of creativity.  If one substitution does not\nyield the desired result, try again.  Another substitute or a\ndifferent amount of the same substitute may work better.\nWould Another Cooking Method Be Healthier?\nThe choice of cooking technique is important.  If the usual\nmethod of cooking uses fat, try grilling, broiling, braising,\nor roasting the food instead.  Instead of deep-fat frying,\ntry oven baking.  French “fries” seasoned with chili powder\nor oregano are both tasty and low in fat when baked.\nAlthough stir “frying” can be a healthful cooking technique,\nuse of generous amounts of oil negates some of the possible\nbenefit.  Always measure the oil to be used or, better yet,\nreplace it with wine or a broth that adds flavor but little fat\nand only a few calories.  Cooking food for the proper time\n(avoiding overcooking) not only makes it taste better but\nalso preserves nutrients.\nChapter 5:  Preparing Healthful Meals\n127\nFOR FATTY FOODS\nChoose:\nInstead of:\nTwo percent, 1 percent, or skim milk; low-fat or fat-free yogurt; \nFull-fat milk, yogurt, sour cream, or cheese\nlow-fat or fat-free sour cream or cheese\nLean, trimmed cuts of the loin and round; remove the skin from  \nFatty and highly marbled meat\npoultry before eating\nApplesauce or fruit purée in place of half the oil or shortening\nShortening, butter, margarine, or oil in baked \nthat is normally used; use the rest of the fat as instructed\ngoods\nPuréed vegetables (carrots or potatoes), mashed potato flakes, \nCreamed soups and gravy-based stews\nor puréed tofu as a thickening agent\nWine, fruit juice, broth, or balsamic vinegar \nOil-based marinades\nVegetable spray \nButter, oil, or margarine to prevent sticking\nTwo egg whites or egg substitute\nA whole egg in a recipe\nRoasted garlic; jam, jelly, or honey (although high in sugar, \nButter or margarine on bread or crackers\nthey have half the calories of butter or margarine and no fat)\nSalsa, low-fat sour cream with chives, low-fat cottage cheese, \nButter or sour cream\nyogurt, herbs, or spices on baked potatoes\nFat-free mayonnaise or salad dressing, mustard, cranberry \nMayonnaise or butter on a sandwich\nsauce, chutney\nFOR FOODS WITH A HIGH SUGAR CONTENT\nChoose:\nInstead of:\nFruit purée, chopped fresh fruit, or applesauce\nSugar, syrup, or honey\nFruit canned in its own juice, fresh fruit\nSweetened fruit \nFOR FOODS WITH A HIGH SALT CONTENT\nChoose:\nInstead of:\nLower-sodium versions \nSoups, sauces (barbecue, soy, tartar, cocktail),\ncanned meat or fish, and crackers\nHerbs, spices, or marinades\nSalt\nCHOOSE THESE ALTERNATIVES TO REDUCE FAT, SUGAR, AND SALT\nTry these ideas for decreasing fat, sugar, and salt when preparing or eating foods.\nMany cooking techniques make it possible to prepare\nmore colorful, flavorful, and healthier dishes.  These include\nthe following:\nBraising—Food is browned, then cooked in a tightly\ncovered pan in a small amount of liquid at low heat over a\nlong period.\nBroiling—Food is placed beneath the heat source; bast-\ning may be needed.\nGrilling—Food is positioned above the heat source;\nbasting may be needed.\nMicrowaving—This is a quick way to cook food with\nlittle added liquid or fat.\nPoaching—Food is cooked in a liquid at the simmer-\ning point. \nOven roasting—Food is cooked in an uncovered pan\nby the free circulation of dry air, until the exterior is well\nbrowned.\nSteaming—Food is placed on a rack in a basket above\nboiling liquid.  Food should not touch the liquid.\nStir frying—Small pieces of food are cooked over high\nheat and constantly stirred.  Use wine, broth, or fruit juice\nas the liquid instead of the traditional oil.\nMarinating food adds flavor and does not have to add\nfat.  Some tips for successful marinating include piercing large\ncuts of meat, poultry, or fish with a fork to help the marinade\npermeate the food.  Always marinate food in a glass or ceramic\ndish in the refrigerator.  Never place the food in a metal\ncontainer.  Most marinades feature an acid base that may\nreact with metal and change the flavor.  Finally, a food safety\ntip:  reserve some of the marinade before you put meat in it.\nMarinade that has been in contact with raw meat should not\nbe used to baste meat, poultry, or fish during the last 15 minutes\nof cooking.  If you plan to use leftover marinade as a table\nsauce, it must be boiled for 5 minutes to eliminate bacteria.\nThere is more that can be done once the food is out of\nthe oven or off the stove.  Skim the fat off pan juices, stews,\nand soups.  Instead of topping vegetables with butter or\nmargarine, sprinkle them with lemon juice or herbs.  Remove\nany visible fat (and any skin from poultry) before serving.\nNo special, expensive equipment is needed to cook\nhealthful foods.  A good set of non-stick pans, a skillet, a\nroasting pan, a baking sheet, measuring cups and spoons,\nand sharp knives are enough to get you started.  Quality,\ndurability, ease of use, and cost should be the primary con-\nsiderations when outfitting a kitchen. \nCan the Amount of Fruits, Grains, and\nVegetables in the Recipe Be Increased?  \nIncreasing the amount of vegetables, grains, and fruits in\na recipe can both improve taste and increase the nutritional\nquality of the food.  For example, when cooking a soup or\nstew, use three times as many vegetables (by measure) as meat.\nAdd generous portions of mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli,\nand green pepper to pizza.  Make pizza even lower in fat and\ncalories by omitting or decreasing the cheese.  Alternatively,\nchoose a lower-fat cheese, such as mozzarella (made from\nskim milk), and use less of it.  If possible, eliminate the\nmeat or add only a small amount of  lean meat.  If you are\nmaking your own crust, make it thin and use whole-grain\nflour.  Pizza, if served with a salad and eaten in moderation,\ncan be an enjoyable and nutritious meal. \nTo get at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day,\nadd them to foods that do not typically include these ingre-\ndients.  For example, add chopped pieces of fruit or vegetables\nto rice, add fruit toppings to toast or pancakes, or top meats\nwith chopped vegetables.  For each serving of meat (a serv-\ning is 2 to 3 ounces of meat), try to eat at least 1 serving each\nof fruit, vegetables, and grains.  When possible, start your\nmeal with a healthful salad.  This often helps you decrease\nthe amount of high-calorie food that you eat later in the meal.\nThe more servings of grains, vegetables, or fruit, the better,\nbecause these are both filling and high in nutrients (see side-\nbar: Nutrition Boosters, page 129).\nCREATING HEALTHFUL MENUS\nPlan menus so that each meal complements what you plan\nto eat later in the day or what you have eaten earlier in the\nday.  Include plant-based entrées as often as possible.\nExamples that can result in satisfying meatless meals include\npasta with marinara sauce and lots of vegetables, stir-fried\nvegetables with tofu over rice, or lentil soup with a side dish\ncontaining grains, beans, or vegetables.  Plant-based entrées\ncan be tasty, filling, and nutritious.\nWhen you choose to eat meat, fish, or poultry, remember\nthat your goal is to eat 6 ounces or less per day.  If you ate meat\nfor lunch, appropriately decrease your dinner portion. Avoid\nred meats that contain a large amount of fat.  Instead,\nemphasize poultry or fish.  When you eat red meat, choose\na “choice” grade and a cut from the loin or round, because\nthese generally are the leanest types of meat.  The skin on\npoultry holds in moisture and flavor during cooking.\n128\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nHowever, the skin is high in fat and calories.  Contrary to\npopular belief, the skin does not need to be removed before\ncooking.  There is minimal fat absorption if the skin is left on.\nJust make sure to remove the skin before the poultry is eaten.  \nMany fish are low in fat.  Those that are not low in fat\ngenerally contain omega-3 fatty acids that may help prevent\nheart disease.  However, remember, all fats are high in calories,\nso the less fat added during cooking, the better. \nCondiments and sauces can add nutrition and enhance\nflavor.  Keep in mind, however, that some are high in fat,\nsodium, and calories (see Chapter 4, “On the Side,” page 86).\nAn example of a high-fat sauce is gravy over mashed pota-\ntoes.  Instead, try sprinkling mashed potatoes with garlic or\nother herbs.\nWhen choosing a topping, look for a lower-fat alternative.\nIf none are available, then use less of the original topping.\nSliced, chopped, or puréed vegetables can make a nour-\nishing low-fat condiment.  Fruits are a delicious complement\nto almost any meal.  They can top meats, enrich salads, or be\nserved for dessert. \nA dessert can be a pleasant end to a healthful meal.\nHowever, a dessert should not be an “extra.”  Be sure it is\nincluded in your overall meal plan.  Make the dessert a\nbonus by emphasizing fruit, whole grains, and lower-fat\nitems.  If you do not have a recipe that emphasizes fruits and\nwhole grains, look for one that can be readily modified.\nSorbets and low-fat frozen yogurts or ice creams are good\nchoices.  Even cookies, pies, cakes, and chocolates have their\nplace.  However, remember, because\nthese desserts generally are high in fat and\nsugar, they are at the pinnacle of the Food\nGuide Pyramid.  Therefore, they should\nbe the exception rather than the rule.  If\nyou plan to eat a dessert, take a small\nportion.  If you are preparing a dessert for\na special occasion, make just enough to\nserve you and your guests.  Leftover\ndessert is a powerful temptation. \nWith a little thought and planning,\nyou know what foods to emphasize and\nwhat foods to limit.  You are ready to\nmake a commitment to improve the way\nyou and your family eat.  Now it is time\nto put your plan into action.  To help you\nget started, examples of  “makeovers” for\nbreakfast and noon and evening meals\nare shown on the following pages.\nChapter 5:  Preparing Healthful Meals\n129\nInstead of:\nSubstitute:\nSyrup\nSliced fruit or a purée of a favorite\non pancakes\nfruit such as apples, berries,\npineapple, or peaches\nSugar on \nFresh fruit or low-fat yogurt\nbreakfast cereal\nWith or in:\nUse:\nChicken breast\nKabobs with fruit and vegetables\nTraditional or\nWhole-grain breads, cooked\ncornbread stuffing\napples, raisins or other dried fruit\nRice\nDiced vegetables, dried fruit, or \nother grains or legumes\nCasseroles\nDecrease meat and add more \nvegetables, grains, bran, legumes, \nor dried fruit\nMeat-based stews\nDecrease meat, and add more \nand soups\nvegetables, legumes, or grains\nPasta\nIn place of meat sauce, use a meat-\nless tomato sauce and add \nsteamed vegetables\nNUTRITION BOOSTERS\nThere are many ways to help you get more fruits, vegetables,\nand grains in the foods you eat.

The final step is to ensure that the food you\nserve is safe to eat.\nBacteria in the Kitchen\nApproximately 7 million cases of food poisoning are reported\nevery year in the United States.  Many other cases are mis-\ntaken for stomach flu or some other infection and therefore\nare never reported.  Food poisoning can be a serious and\npotentially fatal illness.  Fortunately, such severe cases are\nrare.  Bacterial contamination of food can occur if food is\nhandled improperly.  Thus, food safety is of paramount\nimportance.  \nKitchens are replete with chances for passing along the\nbacteria (germs) that cause food poisoning.  It is the respon-\nsibility of the person preparing the meal to make certain that\nfoods and utensils are washed properly.  Unclean kitchen\nutensils can promote food poisoning by growing unwelcome\nbacteria (see sidebar:  Sources of Bacteria, below).\nHand Washing\nSometimes in the rush to prepare meals, it is easy to over-\nlook one of the simplest and most important rules in food\npreparation: wash your hands before handling any food.\nBacteria tend to accumulate on your hands, especially\naround the cuticles and under the fingernails.  To actually\nkill the bacteria, it would take water so hot that it would\nharm your skin.  At least 10 seconds of vigorous rubbing\nwith soap or detergent and warm water is required to rid\nyour hands of germs.  You also should wash your hands\nduring meal preparation if they become contaminated by\nthe food you are handling.\nCross-Contamination\nCross-contamination can lead to food poisoning.  If\nuncooked food has been on a plate or cutting board, that\nplate or cutting board could transfer a potentially infectious\nagent to any other food that comes in contact with it.\nTherefore, always use separate utensils, plates, and cutting\nboards for raw and cooked foods. \nEnsuring Food Safety\nFood safety begins as soon as you purchase the food. Ideally,\nperishable foods should be promptly taken home and\nimmediately refrigerated or frozen.  However, if you need\nto make a stop before reaching home, plan to store meat,\nfish, poultry, and dairy products in a cooler on ice.  Always\nobserve the refrigeration recommendations on packaged\nfoods.  To decrease the total amount of bacteria found on\nraw chicken and other poultry, thoroughly rinse, inside\nand out, under cold water.  After a complete rinse, use hot\nwater and soap to wash out the sink.  Before freezing meat,\npoultry, or fish, divide it into the portion size that you will\nneed to prepare one meal.  When you need to cool a food\nthat you have cooked, quickly transfer it to a shallow\ncontainer.  Cover it and refrigerate it immediately.  Bacteria\nthrive at temperatures between 40° and 140° Fahrenheit,\npotentially doubling in number every 20 to 30 minutes.\nTherefore, the most important food safety rule in the\nkitchen is:  Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.\nDefrosting Food\nThaw poultry, fish, and meat in the refrigerator.  Defrosting\nat room temperature promotes thawing on the outside\nwhile the core remains frozen.  The soft outer portion pro-\nvides a fertile site for bacterial growth.  Instead, put frozen\nfood in the refrigerator (which is cool but above freezing)\n148\nPart I:  A Guide to Healthy Nutrition\nBACTERIA SOURCE\nSOLUTION\nCutting boards\nKeep two on hand—one for\nmeat and the other for produce\nor breads*\nSponges, dish cloths,\nChange and wash frequently\nand towels\nKnives and utensils\nUse separate knives and utensils\nfor raw and cooked foods.\nWash all utensils with hot water\nand soap\nCountertops\nWash frequently with soap and\nhot water, particularly after\nworking with meat, poultry,\nand fish \n*A simple cleaning solution that helps to keep bacteria \nin check is to mix 1 tablespoon of bleach to 1 gallon of\nwater.  Generously spray the surface and let it stand for\nseveral minutes.  Rinse and dry with a clean towel.\nSOURCES OF BACTERIA\n1 or 2 days before it is to be used.  For faster thawing, run\ncold water over the item or use a microwave for quick\ndefrosting.\nMarinade Savvy\nMarinate poultry, seafood, and meat in the refrigerator.  To\nplay it safe, set some of the marinade aside (to use for basting\nor as a sauce at the table) before adding it to the raw meat.\nAvoid using the liquid that the raw meat has been marinating\nin for basting.  If you do, discontinue basting at least 15\nminutes before the meat is done so that the marinade can\nbe heated to a high enough temperature to kill any bacteria\nthat may be present.  Do not use the leftover marinade as\na sauce unless it has not come in contact with the raw meat\nor you have boiled it for at least 5 minutes.  \nCooking Food\nAlways be sure to cook recipes at the appropriate temper-\nature.  Cooking foods to an internal temperature of at least\n160° Fahrenheit kills most dangerous bacteria.  Uncooked\nor undercooked meat can harbor pathogens such as the\nnotorious E. coli bacteria (see sidebar:  Cooking It Safe,\nthis page).\nUsing Slow Cookers\nUsing a slow cooker is a popular way of preparing soups,\nstews, roasts, and other hearty dishes.  Because this device\ncooks at relatively low temperatures—compared with the\noven or stovetop—it is vital to exercise safe cooking habits.\nFor example, thaw meat thoroughly and cut it into small\npieces.  Use recipes that call for plenty of liquid.  Bring to\na boil quickly and then reduce heat to simmer.  Do not\noverfill the cooker.  Be sure to use a thermometer to make\ncertain the temperature stays at 160° Fahrenheit or higher.\nSERVING SAFELY\nAfter taking care to prepare and cook food as safely as\npossible, don’t contaminate it while it is being served.  Here\nare a few tips. Avoid letting cooked foods cool on the table.\nDo not allow foods that contain perishable ingredients\n(such as raw eggs, homemade sauces, eggnog, or home-\nmade Caesar dressing) to remain at room temperature for\nlonger than a few minutes.  Once finished serving, always\npromptly place cooked or perishable foods in the refriger-\nator or freezer.  At a picnic or party, keep cold foods on\nice and hot foods properly heated. \nDishes, serving bowls, or other items made of glazed\nlead-containing pottery can cause poisoning, particularly\nin young children.  Make sure that the container that is\nused for cooking and serving is properly glazed (manufacture\nby a domestic pottery dealer should ensure this).  If in\ndoubt, use the pottery for decoration rather than for cooking\nor serving food.\nREFRIGERATING OR FREEZING FOOD\nIf warm or hot food is headed for storage in the refrigerator\nor freezer, do not allow it to cool on the countertop.  Place\nwarm or hot food into a shallow pan to facilitate cooling and\nthen put it directly into the refrigerator or freezer.  If the\nquantity of food is large, distribute it in two or more\ncontainers to enable quicker cooling.\nCLEAN IT\nWhen you have finished eating, thoroughly wash pots and\npans, utensils, and all kitchen surfaces (counter, stove tops,\nand sink) with soap and hot water.  Let cutting boards and\nutensils air dry.  Wash or replace sponges and dish towels\nfrequently.  If you have an automatic dishwasher, it may be\nhelpful to have two sponges so you can wash one with each\nload of dishes. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE ON FOOD SAFETY\nWith a little care, you can minimize the risk that you or\nothers will develop a food-borne illness.\nChapter 5:  Preparing Healthful Meals\n149\nTEMPERATURE\nTYPE OF FOOD\n(DEGREES FAHRENHEIT)\nFish and seafood\n145 \nRed meat or pork \n(including ground)\n160 \nGround chicken or turkey\n165 \nPoultry—breast\n170\nWhole poultry and thighs\n180\nEggs\nCook until egg white and \nyolk are firm, not runny\nCOOKING IT SAFE\nENCYCLOPEDIA\nFOODS\nOF\nP\na\nr\nt\n \nI I\nP\nart I of this book reviewed the relationship of diet to health and provided recommenda-\ntions for choosing foods and planning diets that contribute to health.  The healthiest\ndiets are based on a variety of plant foods—whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and\nnuts.  Animal products and added fats and oils, sugars, and other sweeteners are best consumed\nin small quantities.  The Food Guide Pyramid reviewed earlier in this book graphically\nemphasizes the proportions of these foods in the daily diet.  Accordingly, we have arranged\nthis section with priority given to grains, fruits, and vegetables—those items that should\npredominate at every meal and that most people need to consume in greater quantities.\nAnimal products—meat and other high-protein foods and dairy foods—are also discussed.\nHowever, these are the foods that should make up relatively smaller parts of our diets.  \nPart II introduces you to many foods from which you can choose and provides you with\nknowledge about the nutrients these foods have to offer.  In addition, we provide informa-\ntion about the sources of the foods you purchase and eat—the individual plants and animals,\nhow they are processed to the products that appear on store shelves, and some of the history\nof these foods in our diet.\nBefore we introduce the foods themselves, we want to explain the arrangement and\npresentation of food items in these sections.  Because this book is written for a North American\naudience, we have included food products that are available to most North Americans.\nWithin the sections on Fruits and Vegetables, we have listed items by their common names\nin alphabetical order; when a food has more than one common name, the index should help\nin locating the item.  Where there is a difference between the cultural or common use or\nperception of an item and its botanical nature, we have listed it according to common usage\nand mentioned the difference in the text.  For example, although cucumbers, eggplant,\nsquash, and tomatoes are botanically fruits, they are listed within\nthe vegetable section, because most American consumers\nthink of them as vegetables.  \nThe nutrient compositions of foods are derived\nfrom the current version of the U.S. Department\nof Agriculture (USDA) nutrient composition\ndatabase.  This database is maintained and updated\nregularly by USDA laboratories and is the basis of\nmost systems for estimating the nutrient content \nof foods and diets.\n151\n152\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\n153\nFruits\nO\nur earliest ancestors built their diets entirely of vegetables, fruits, seeds, grains, legumes, and\nnuts.  Throughout history, “fruit” has referred to any plant used as a food.  More recently,\n“fruit” has come to mean the edible pulp or fleshy layer around a seed.  In the 18th century, the\nword acquired a botanical definition:  the organ derived from the ovary and surrounding the\nseed.  At the same time, culinary custom defined fruits by their sweetness (or the balance of sweet\nto sour) and by how they are used in the meal, primarily as dessert.  Thus, even though eggplant,\ncucumber, squash, and tomatoes are technically fruits, we call them vegetables.  \nUntil recently, the availability of a fruit during the year depended on its growing season.  For\nexample, strawberries appeared in April and May, melons in August and September, whereas\nsome fruits, such as apples and bananas, were available year-round.  Today, reliable transporta-\ntion brings fruit of every type to our markets year-round, although some imported fruits may be\nmore costly during the winter than their domestic counterparts are in the summer when they\nare in season.\nThe revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans includes as 1 of its 10 principles the advice to\neat a variety of fruits (and vegetables) daily.  (For a discussion of the Dietary Guidelines and the\n5 a Day program, see Chapter 1, page 8.)  \nTo help you to be better informed and better plan your menus, this section provides information\non the origin and nutrient content of many fruits.  [(See the Appendix, page 434, for further\ninformation about the nutrient content of fruits.)]  Fruit is a valuable source of fiber, vitamin\nC, some of the B vitamins, vitamin A, and other antioxidants and phytonutrients.  (See the\nAppendix, Phytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484).\nThe tables of nutrient values in the Fruits section are based on serving sizes specified by the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid.  Nutrient values are rounded (milligrams\nand micrograms tend to be rounded to one decimal point, grams are rounded to whole numbers).\nNutrient claim statements listed beneath the common name of each fruit are based on the serving\nsize specified and the definitions in Chapter 4 (see sidebar:  Nutrient Claims, page 92).  For\nexample, 1 medium apple is considered a good source of vitamin C, because an apple provides 13\npercent of the Daily Value for vitamin C.  A food that is high in a particular nutrient provides 20\npercent or more of the Daily Value for that nutrient per serving.\n154\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nThe Florida Sweet variety, commonly\ngrown in California, yields large, juicy\nfruits that have a taste similar to apples.\nManoa Sweet, a variety developed in\nHawaii, has orange-red fruits that are espe-\ncially sweet.  A dwarf variety, which grows\nto a height of only 2 feet, can tolerate lower\ntemperatures than the other varieties and\nis suited for container cultivation.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe acerola is believed to have originated\nin the Yucatán peninsula of Mexico.\nSince its discovery, the plant has been\nintroduced throughout the tropical and\nsubtropical regions of the world, but it is\nstill primarily grown in and around the\nWest Indies.\nThe acerola is a large, bushy shrub that\ncan attain a height of 15 feet.  Although\nthe plant grows best in hot tropical low-\nlands with medium to high rainfall, it is\nalso very drought-tolerant.  Acerolas need\nprotection against frost and winds because\ntheir root system is shallow and they can\nbe toppled by high winds.  The leaves  are\ncovered with hair, are light to dark green,\nand become glossy when mature.  The\nsmall, white to pink flowers bloom\nthroughout the year.  Because up to 90\npercent of the blossoms fall from the\nplant, only a few of the flowers set fruit.\nWhen grown from seed, plants begin to\nfruit after 2 or 3 years.  An 8-year-old tree\nmay yield 30 to 60 pounds of fruit a year.\nUses\nBecause acerolas deteriorate quickly and\nundergo rapid fermentation once removed\nfrom the tree, they should be refrigerated\nif not used immediately. Unrefrigerated\nfruits can develop mold within 3 to 5\ndays.  Acerolas can be eaten raw, made\ninto jams and jellies, or puréed into juice.\nThey have been used as a supplemental\nsource of vitamin C, to make  baby food,\nand as an ingredient in ice cream.\nNutrient composition\nAcerolas contain  the most concentrated\nsource of natural vitamin C of any known\nfruit, 100 times the vitamin C content\nof  oranges and 10 times that of the guava.\nGreen (unripe) fruits have twice the vit-\namin C content of ripe fruits.

As a result, apples are avail-\nable in a seemingly endless array of colors,\ncrispness, texture, size, sweetness, and aroma.\nSome of the more popular varieties in the\nU.S. marketplace are the Red and Golden\nDelicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, and\nRome Beauty.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe apple is native to Asia and eastern\nEurope.  The earliest recorded descrip-\ntion of apples appears in Greek literature\nof the 4th century B.C.  The first apples\ncultivated in the New World were grown\nfrom seed brought by the Pilgrims.\nToday, the leading apple-producing\nnations are Russia, China, the United\nStates, Germany, France, and Italy.  In\nthe United States, nearly half the domestic\ncrop is grown in Washington, and New\nYork, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania,\nNorth Carolina, and Virginia produce for\nmuch of the rest of the domestic market.\nSERVING\nSIZE:1 medium (138 g)\nApple\nbreakfast cereal.  Characteristics of flavor\nand texture determine the optimal varieties\nfor each use.  Crisp, crunchy, juicy, sweet\nor sweet-tart apples such as the Granny\nSmith, Fuji, Gala, or Red Delicious are\nbest for eating.  In general, firm-fleshed,\ntart apples such as the Golden Delicious\nand Rome Beauty are best for baking\nwhole.  Tart or slightly sour varieties are\ngood for pies and applesauce.\nNutrient composition\nA medium-sized fresh apple is a good\nsource of vitamin C; however, most of\nthe vitamin C is lost when the apple is\ncooked or made into juice.\nApples are a good source of dietary\nfiber in the form of pectin.\nFamily Rosaceae\nScientific name Malus pumila, \nMalus sylvestris, Pyrus malus\nCommon name apple\n♥Good source of pectin, a soluble fiber\nthat helps reduce blood cholesterol\n♥A good source of vitamin C\nThe apple is a pome, a round fruit that consists of firm, juicy flesh covered by a\nthin, tough, edible skin and surrounding a cartilaginous, seeded core.  The skin\ncolor of apples can range from dark green to yellow to bright red, or some\ncombination of these colors.  Apples that are \njust ripe are crisp and juicy, whereas \nthose that are overripe attain \nan aromatic flavor and a \nslightly mealy texture.\nApples can grow virtually anywhere\nwith a moderate climate, although some\nvarieties are better suited to a particular\nregion.  Because fruit-bearing seasons vary\nby variety and region, apples are available\nall year.  Standard-sized trees reach a\nheight and spread of 25 feet and require\n5 to 10 years to fruit.  Recently, dwarf\nand semidwarf trees have emerged; these\nrequire as few as 2 years to bear fruit.\nUses\nWhen selecting apples, choose those with\nfirm flesh and tight skin that is free of\nbruises, soft spots, and holes.  Larger\napples tend to be more mealy than small\nones.  To ripen apples, keep them at room\ntemperature.  Apples store well for long\nperiods refrigerated or in a cool, dry place.\nSliced apples quickly turn brown on expo-\nsure to air; however, this can be prevent-\ned by dipping the fruit into acidulated\nwater (dilute lemon juice).\nAs one of the most popular fruits in\nthe United States, apples are widespread\nin the American cuisine.  They are used\nin salads, alongside meats, and in pilafs,\ndesserts, preserves, juices, cider, pies,\nbreads, cakes, and alcoholic beverages\n(such as the liqueur calvados).  Dried\napples make tasty snacks or additions to\n156\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nApproximately 12 varieties of apricots\nexist, with flesh that varies from yellow\nto deep orange.  Some of the better\nknown varieties are the Blenheim, the\nTilton, the Patterson, and the Castlebrite.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe world’s leading producers of apricots\nare Turkey, Italy, Russia, and Greece.\nNinety percent of the U.S. domestic\nmarket is supplied by growers in\nCalifornia; Utah and Washington supply\nthe rest.  During the off-season, apricots\nare imported from Chile and New\nZealand.  Apricot trees grow to about 20\nfeet in height and spread to a width of 30\nfeet.  The white or pink flowers  appear in\nearly spring and give way to  fruits in late\nsummer.  Because of this early flowering,\napricot yield may be limited by late frosts\nthat kill the flowers.  The domestic crop\nis available from mid-May to mid-August,\nand imports arrive in December and\nJanuary.\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n34\nWater (%) \n86\nDietary fiber (grams)\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n8\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n10\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n207\nMagnesium\n6\nPhosphorus\n13\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n183 RE\nVitamin C\n7\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n6 μg\nVitamin E\n1\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n2, raw (70 g)\nApricot\nFamily Rosaceae\nScientific name Prunus armeniaca\nCommon name apricot\n♥Good source of vitamin C\n♥High in vitamin A (beta-carotene)\nThe apricot is a round, fleshy fruit that is closely related to the peach, plum,\nalmond, and cherry.  It has a single seed enclosed \nin a stony shell.  The edible, pale-orange skin \nis smooth and velvety.  The flesh \nis drier than that of most \nother fruits.\nUses\nApricots are best when purchased ripe or\nslightly underripe and allowed to ripen\nin a paper bag.  Green-tinged fruits will\nnot ripen properly and should be avoided.\nRipe apricots can be stored in the refrig-\nerator up to a week, but apricots that are\nsoft and juicy should be eaten within a\nday or two of purchase.  Apricots should\nbe washed just before they are eaten.\nThey are excellent eaten out of hand or\nused in any recipe that calls for peaches or\nnectarines.  Apricots should not be\ncooked for an extended time because they\ntend to lose their flavor rather quickly;\npoaching is an ideal cooking method.\nDried apricots are a convenient, nonper-\nishable snack.\nNutrient composition\nFresh apricots are high in vitamin A (beta-\ncarotene) and are a good source of vita-\nmin C.

The\nFuerte avocado, a Guatemalan-Mexican\nhybrid, has a more pronounced pear\nshape and is slightly larger than the Hass.\nIt has a shiny, thin, dark-green skin with\nsmall, raised, pale spots.  Florida-grown\nvarieties, which are Mexican in origin and\ninclude the Booth, Waldin, and Lula, are\nlarger, less costly, and more perishable\nthan California avocados.  In addition,\nthey contain less fat and fewer calories\nand lack the rich, creamy flavor of the\nCalifornia varieties.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe avocado, native to the tropics and sub-\ntropics of Central America, was first cul-\ntivated in the United States in the mid-\n1800s in Florida and California.  Ninety\npercent of today’s domestic crop of avoca-\ndos is grown in California.  With a har-\nvest of 168,000 tons, the United States is\nthe second-largest grower of avocados in\nthe world, behind Mexico at 718,000 tons.\nThe avocado tree, a popular shade tree\nin rural and suburban Hawaii, California,\nand Florida, is a dense evergreen that may\nreach a height of 80 feet.  \nAvocados do not ripen on the tree;\nripening is inhibited by hormones pro-\nduced by the leaves.  This delay in ripen-\ning is a commercial advantage because\nthe fruit may be left unharvested for long\nperiods (up to 7 months).  However, over-\nripe avocados may seed internally and\nbecome moldy.\nUses\nAvocados that are unblemished and heavy\nfor their size are best.  Ripe avocados yield\nslightly to finger pressure, but if the finger\nleaves a dent, the avocado may be over-\nripe. Ripening can be hastened by enclos-\ning the fruit in a paper bag and leaving at\nroom temperature.  Ripe avocados should\nbe refrigerated and used within 1 to 2 days.\nBecause cooking destroys the flavor\nof avocados, it is not recommended.\nFresh avocados can be sliced and added\nto cooked dishes just before serving.  They\ncan be diced and mixed into salads,\nmashed to use in toppings or dips, puréed\nto use in cold soups and desserts, or\njulienned to include in sushi rolls.  When\nexposed to air, avocado flesh discolors\nquickly.  Addition of lemon or lime juice\nto mashed or puréed avocados can delay\ndiscoloration.  Placing an avocado pit in\na bowl of mashed avocados will not\nprevent discoloration.\nNutrient composition\nAvocados are known for their high fat\ncontent; however, most is monounsaturated\nfat.  They are low in saturated fat and are\nsodium- and cholesterol-free.  Avocados are\na good source of dietary fiber.  They also\ncontain lutein, one of the carotenes that is a\nphytochemical with antioxidant properties.\nFamily  Lauraceae\nScientific name Persea americana \nCommon name avocado, alligator pear\n♥Rich source of monounsaturated fat\n♥Good source of fiber\nThe avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with skin that can be thick or thin, green \nor purplish black, and smooth or bumpy, depending \non the variety.  The flesh of the avocado is pale \nyellow-green and has the consistency of firm \nbutter and a faint nut-like flavor.\n158\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nThe familiar yellow banana sold in the\nUnited States is the Cavendish variety,\nwhich is 5 to 10 inches in length and\navailable all year.  Red bananas from Latin\nAmerica are slightly wider and are heavier\nand sweeter than yellow bananas.  Their\nred skin turns purple when ripe. Manzano\nbananas (also called finger or apple\nbananas) are short and chubby with a\nmild, strawberry-apple flavor.  They turn\nfully black when ripe. Plantains (also called\ngreen or cooking bananas), thick-skinned\nbananas that range from green to yellow\nto brown-black, are a staple food in many\nparts of the world.  When unripe plan-\ntains are cooked, they have no banana\nflavor; however, when cooked ripe, they\nhave a sweet banana taste and a slightly\nchewy texture.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nOriginating in the Malaysian region about\n4,000 years ago, the banana was not intro-\nduced to the Americas until the Philadelphia\nCentennial Exhibition of 1876.

The United States\ngrows about 4,000 tons of bananas annu-\nally and imports a total of 1.6 million tons\nannually from South America.  Worldwide,\nIndia is the largest banana grower, followed\nby Africa, where bananas are mostly kept\nfor local use.\nA banana tree is technically not a tree,\nbut rather a tree-like herb that belongs to\nthe grass family.  It can attain a height of\n10 to 40 feet when fully grown.  The banana\nis actually a berry that has been cultivated\nto have no seeds.  The non-woody banana\nstalk develops a flowering stem and seven\nto nine buds that each sustain one cluster\n(hand) of 10 to 20 bananas (fingers).  The\nstalks are cut after producing the fruit, and\nnew stems grow from buds in the rootstock.\nUses\nRipening of green bananas can be hastened\nby putting the fruit into a paper bag. Ripe\nbananas can be stored in the refrigerator\nfor up to 2 weeks; although the skin turns\ndark brown, the fruit remains edible.\nUnripe bananas should not be refriger-\nated.

The term is loosely applied \nto a range of fruits belonging to vastly diverse botanical families.  Aside \nfrom the more popular berries such as the blackberry, blueberry, \ncranberry, currant, raspberry, and strawberry, there are a host of \nless common species, each with its own distinctive shape, color, \nfragrance, and taste.  Berries were a staple in the diets of \nour hunting-and-gathering ancestors and still play an \nimportant role in the culinary traditions of many \npeoples around the world.  American Indians used \nvarious types of berries as food, medicine, dyes, and food \npreservatives.  Early American settlers developed a taste for \nthe many varieties growing wild in woods and fields of North \nAmerica, and they learned to use the berries for food and medicine.\nResearch has shown that several berries have medicinal properties.  \n(Cranberries and blueberries help prevent urinary tract infections.)  \nMost berries contain generous amounts of vitamin C, and some \nare a good source of fiber because of the skin and seeds.\nFruits\n159\nBlackberries are high in vitamin C, are\na good source of dietary fiber, and contain\nellagic acid, a phytochemical that may help\nprevent cancer.\nBlueberry\nFamily  Ericaceae\nScientific name Vaccinium myrtillis\nCommon name blueberry\nthe Marion (a tart variety).

Borne in loose\nclusters on stems that grow from the\ncanes, the berries change from green to\nred and then to purplish black as they\nripen.  Blackberry bushes are so vigor-\nously invasive that they are considered a\nweed in some areas.\nPlump, deeply colored blackberries\nare the most delicious to eat, and immature\nred berries are tart. Blackberries are best\nused immediately, because they spoil\nquickly.  They can be lightly covered and\nrefrigerated for 1 to 2 days.  Blackberries can\nbe eaten fresh; used as a topping for\nyogurt, ice cream, and pancakes; tossed\ninto a fruit salad; puréed to make a dessert\nsauce; or made into blackberry pie.  About\n98 percent of commercially produced\nberries are processed into jams, fillings,\njuices, wines, and brandies.\nBlackberry\nFamily  Rosaceae\nScientific name Rubus fructicosus\n(European), Rubus villosus (American)\nCommon name blackberry, bramble berry,\ndewberry, goutberry\nBerries\nAlso called bramble berries because they\ngrow on thorny bushes (brambles), black-\nberries range from one-half to an inch\nlong when mature and are purplish black.\nLike raspberries, to which they are related,\nblackberries are oblong and are made up\nof small edible seeds that are encased in\njuicy globules adjoining a fleshy base.\nThe most common varieties of black-\nberry are the Cherokee (a sweet variety) and\nBlueberries, a species native to North\nAmerica, grow in shades varying from light\nblue to dark purple.

The berries are very perishable\nand easily damaged by improper handling\nand extreme temperatures.\nBlueberries are one of the most popu-\nlar berries in the United States, second\nonly to strawberries.  They can be eaten\ndried or fresh as a snack food; added to\ncereals, salads, yogurt, or ice cream; used\nas an ingredient in pancakes, muffins,\npies, breads, or sauces or as cake topping;\nor puréed to make jam or jelly.  Although\nthe blueberry season is short, berries can\nbe bought in the off-season in frozen,\ncanned, or dried form.\nBlueberries are a good source of\nvitamin C.\nRecent research has shown that blue-\nberries may help prevent urinary tract\ninfection by increasing the acidity of\nurine, which helps destroy bacteria, and\nby preventing bacteria from colonizing\non the bladder walls.\nCranberry\nFamily  Ericaceae\nScientific name Vaccinium macrocarpon,\nVaccinium oxycoccus\nCommon name cranberry, bounceberry,\nlingonberry\nor “bloom.” Blueberries were once called\nstar berries because of the star-shaped calyx\non the top of each fruit. Cultivated blue-\nberries can be as large as 3/4 inch in diame-\nter, although the “wild” varieties are only\n1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter.\nAt least 50 species of blueberries, both\ncultivated and wild, have been identified.\nThe two types of cultivated blueberries are\nhighbrush and rabbiteye.  Highbrush\nblueberries, V. corymbosum L., are grown\nthroughout North America, whereas the\nrabbiteye varieties, V. ashei Reade, are better\nadapted to southern regions of the United\nStates. Lowbush (wild) blueberries, V.\nangustifolium Ait., grow naturally in Maine,\nNova Scotia, and Quebec. These plants\nproduce blueberries that are prized for their\nintense flavor.  The lowbush (wild) blue-\nberry varieties grow to about 3 feet in\nheight, whereas the highbush and rabbiteye\ncultivars can grow to more than 10 feet if\nnot pruned.  The desirable flavor, color,\nand texture of today’s cultivars are the result\nof nearly 100 years of hybridization.\nBlueberries have been used as a source\nof food and folk medicine for thousands of\nyears.  Early explorers of North America,\nsuch as Lewis and Clark, noted that\nAmerican Indians smoked the berries to pre-\nserve them for winter and pounded the\nberries with beef to make a jerky called pem-\nmican.  Blueberries were also appreciated\nby the early American settlers as both a food\nand a medicine.\nThe blueberry plant is a compact,\nwoody shrub that is related to the bilberry,\ncranberry, and huckleberry. Blueberries\ngrow in clusters, but because the berries\nripen at different times,  they must be\nhandpicked to harvest the best of the early\nfruit.  Later, a harvesting machine is used\nto gently shake each bush so that only the\nripe berries fall off.  The blueberry sea-\nson lasts only from mid-April to late\nSeptember, beginning in the southern\nstates and moving north as the season\nmaroon.  About one-third of an inch in\ndiameter and half-inch to an inch long, the\ncranberry has seeds that are attached to the\ncenter of the fruit and are surrounded by a\ntart white pulp.  Also called bounceberries,\nbecause they bounce when ripe, cranberries\nbelong to the same family as blueberries\nand huckleberries; but unlike these fruits,\ncranberries are too tart to eat raw.\nCranberries are divided into three\ntypes.  The most common is the large\nVaccinium macrocarpon, grown for com-\nmercial purposes.  Vaccinium oxycoccus,\ncommonly called the mossberry or small\ncranberry,  is found wild in some areas.\nVaccinium vitis-idaea, or the lingonberry,\ngrows well in very cold climates and is\ncurrently being developed as a crop in\nseveral eastern European countries.\nCranberries grow on a flat, woody,\nevergreen “vine” that thrives in acidic soil.\nCranberry vines are planted in peat bogs\nprepared in a way that allows the plants\nto be covered with water to protect them\nfrom cold damage.  The pink or purple\ncranberry flowers can be self-pollinated,\nbut crop yield is much greater when bees\nare used to facilitate pollination. The\nberries are borne on short uprights 6 to 8\ninches in length that rise from a dense\nmass of stems on the soil surface.\nCranberries are extensively cultivated\nfor commercial use in the northern states.\nMassachusetts is the largest producer,\nfollowed by Wisconsin, New Jersey,\nWashington, and Oregon.  Cranberry\ncultivation is also common throughout\nCanada. Harvested between Labor Day\nand Halloween, cranberries enjoy their\npeak market season from October\nthrough December.\nThe Pilgrims dined on cranberry\ndishes at the first Thanksgiving in 1621.\nOnce only a traditional holiday food,\ncranberries are now consumed through-\nout the year as juice drinks, dried snacks,\nsauces, and relishes.  Because of their sour\nCranberries, which are native to North\nAmerica, are small, smooth-skinned, round\nberries that are glossy deep red to red-\nFruits\n161\nleaves resemble those of the maple tree\nin shape, but they are pale green on black\ncurrant bushes and dark blue-green on\nred currant plants.  Some varieties are\nupright, and others spread.  The self-\nfertilizing flowers that give rise to red\ncurrants are green, and those that\nproduce black currants are pink.  Plants\nare generally pollinated by insects.  The\nberries, averaging about a fourth of an\ninch in diameter, hang in clusters from\ndelicate, drooping stems called strigs.\nCurrants prefer cold climates, heavy,\nmoist, enriched  soil, and full sun or light\nshade.  Although they can be propagated\nby seed in the spring or by cuttings in\nthe early fall, bushes grown from seed\nproduce no fruit for 2 to 3 years.\nPruning to remove wood that is more\nthan 3 years old encourages the growth\nof new shoots.\nBlack currants are harvested selectively\nas they ripen and before they shrivel and\nfall from the bush.  Red and white cur-\nrants are pulled by the cluster to avoid\ndamaging the delicate fruit.  If the berries\nare going to be used for jams or jellies,\nthey must be picked before they ripen\nfully because that is when the fruit pectin\nlevels are highest.  Berries grown for eat-\ning are allowed to ripen on the bush for\nseveral weeks after achieving  full color.\nA mature currant bush can produce up\nto 4 quarts of fruit each year.\nBecause of their tartness, currants,\nparticularly black currants, are rarely eaten\nas fresh fruit. Instead, they are made into\njams and jellies or used in pies and sauces.\nBlack currants are sometimes soaked in\nbrandy or made into wine, sometimes\nmixed with honey and spirits. Black cur-\nrants are the basis for the French liqueur\ncrème de cassis.  An infusion of the young\nleaves of the black currant shrub makes\na drink similar to green tea.\nCurrants are high in vitamin C.  Black\ncurrants are a good source of potassium.\ntaste, they must be combined with sweet\nfoods such as sugar or orange juice to\nmake them palatable.

They have a soft, juicy\npulp that contains several edible seeds.\nThe flavor of currants varies from slightly\nto exceedingly tart. True currants are not\nto be confused with the zante currant, a\nvariety of small, dried grape (raisin).\nCurrants are categorized by their\ncolor. Common red currants include the\nRed Lake, a mild-flavored, bright-red\nberry, and the Perfection, a medium to\nlarge, flavorful variety.  The White\nImperial, a small, round, white berry that\ngrows on a spreading bush, has the lowest\nacid content of any currant.  The most\ncommon pink currant is the Gloire des\nSablons, an ancient French variety with\npink flesh and colorless skin.  The\nBoskoop is a well-flavored black currant,\nproduced on a vigorous, upright bush.  The\nWilloughby is a mild, black Canadian\ncurrant that is hardy to cold and sun and\nresists mildew.\nCurrants appear to have originated in\nnorthern Europe, northern Africa, Siberia,\nand in the Western Hemisphere, where\nthey were eaten by American Indians well\nbefore their first contact with Europeans.\nAmerican Indians historically have used\ncurrants for both food and medicinal\npurposes.  The Coast Salish Indians of\nVancouver Island boiled the fruit and dried\nit into rectangular cakes for use as a win-\nter food.  The Woodlands Cree Indians\nused currant jam as a condiment for fish,\nmeat, and bread. Before 1550, the English\ncalled this fruit ribes, a name of ancient\nIndo-European origin.  Subsequently, the\nberries came to be called currants, a word\nderived from the berry’s resemblance to\nthe dried Greek raisins that are made from\nsmall seedless grapes.  English and\nEuropean colonists in the Americas found\ncurrants growing wild in woods and fields\nand quickly developed a taste for them.\nToday, currants are commonly cultivated\nin Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and the\nUnited States.  Europeans and Canadians\nseem to prefer black currants, and the less\ntart red and white varieties are more pop-\nular among Americans.\nCurrant plants are fast-growing,\ndeciduous, perennial shrubs that can\nreach 5 feet in height and width.

The eastern elderberry Sambucus\ncanadensis and the Western Sambucus\ncoerulea are two common varieties.\nThe elder tree, which belongs to the\nhoneysuckle family, has been around for\ncenturies and may date back to the Stone\nAge.  The Egyptians harvested its flowers\nand extracted their essence to use as\nmedicine and to beautify the skin. In the\nMiddle Ages, it was believed that the elder\ntree was home to witches and that cut-\nting it down would create trouble by\ndisturbing those residing in the branches.\nIn contrast, the Russians and the English\nbelieved that the elder tree warded off evil\nspirits.  Hence, it was considered good\nluck to plant an elder tree near one’s\nhome.

Raspberries are\nfragrant and sweet, with a slight tartness.\nThe raspberry is sometimes considered\nthe most intensely flavored of the berry\nfamily.\nTraces of wild raspberries have been\nfound at prehistoric sites in Asia, and\nAmerican Indians used wild raspberries\nmedicinally.  Red raspberries have been\ncultivated in Europe for more than 400\nyears, brought home by Crusaders who\nfound them growing in the Mount Ida\nregion in Turkey. During the 18th\ncentury, the cultivation of raspberries\nimproved, and by the 19th century, they\nwere being grown widely throughout\nEurope and North America.  By the 1860s,\nmore than 40 varieties were known.  Today,\nabout 90 percent of all domestic rasp-\nberries are grown in Oregon, Washington,\nand California, with some imported from\nCanada and Chile during the off-peak\nseason.\nRaspberries are thorny, perennial\nbushes that can reach heights of 10 feet.\nThey prefer cool summers, mild winters,\nand a dry harvest season.  Three years is\nrequired for the bushes to begin produc-\ning the delicate white flowers from which\nthe berries form on erect stalks or canes.\nMature berries must be handled carefully\nbecause they are fragile and easily damaged.\nSome are packed in small containers for\nthe fresh market, but the bulk of the har-\nvest is processed into frozen, concentrated,\nor canned forms.\nRaspberries are best eaten within 1 to\n2 days of purchase.  If possible, they should\nnot be washed, because they absorb water\nMulberry\nFamily  Moraceae\nScientific name Morus species\nCommon name mulberry\nBotanically, the mulberry is not a berry\nbut a collective fruit.  After the flowers\nare pollinated, they and their fleshy bases\nswell and become succulent and full of\njuice, like the drupes of a blackberry,\nwhich the mulberry resembles in size and\nshape.\nThere are three principal species, the\nnames of which refer not to the color of\nthe fruit but to the color of the buds.  The\nblack mulberry (M. nigra) is native to\nwestern Asia and has been grown in\nEurope and the Middle East since ancient\ntimes for its fruits. Large, juicy, and bluish\nblack, the black mulberry is no doubt the\nmost flavorful, with its refreshing com-\nbination of sweetness and tartness.  The\nAmerican, or red, mulberry (M. rubra),\nindigenous to the eastern United States,\ngrows wild from Massachusetts  to the Gulf\nCoast. Usually a deep red-purple, the red\nmulberry is not as tasty as its black cousin.\nThe white mulberry (M. alba) is the least\ntasty of the three, with an unpleasant\nsweetness that lacks the pleasing tartness\nof the black mulberry.  The plant is native\nto eastern and central China, where the\ntree has long been cultivated for its leaves,\nRaspberries are small aggregate fruits,\ncomposed of numerous, small drupelets,\neach containing a small seed and\nclustering together around a central core.\nThey range from a half to an inch or more\nin diameter.  When the berry is picked\n164\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nBerries\nand become mushy, but they can be rinsed\nquickly just before serving.  Whole berries\ncan be frozen for up to 1 year.\nFresh raspberries make a delicious top-\nping for cereals, pancakes and waffles,\nyogurt, puddings, cake, and ice cream; a\ncolorful, sweet addition to fruit or green\nsalads; and an excellent snack eaten right\nout of hand.  They can be preserved in\nbrandy or syrup or added to vinegar to make\na delicious salad dressing.  Raspberries make\nwonderful tarts, jams, jellies, compotes,\nwine, and beer and are an elegant addition\nto champagne and punch.  Cooked rasp-\nberries, mixed with a touch of lemon or\norange juice to enhance their color, make\na tasty sauce for chicken and fish dishes.\nRaspberries are high in vitamin C and\nare also a good source of both soluble and\ninsoluble fiber.\nSTrawberry\nFamily  Rosaceae\nScientific name Fragaria vesca, Fragaria\namericana\nCommon name strawberry\nare pollinated.  The real fruits are the 200\nseeds, called achene, that cover the berry’s\nsurface.  The plant itself is a low-grow-\ning perennial that produces horizontal\nrunners, or stolons, that spread out from\nthe base and take root to form new plants.\nThe hundreds of varieties of straw-\nberries in the United States, which vary in\nsize, color, and taste, are distinguished\nprimarily by their locale. Some California\nvarieties include Chandler, Selva,\nSeascape, and Camaroso.  Florida vari-\neties include the Florida 90, with large,\nred, flavorful fruit; the Tioga, a large,\nvigorous plant with medium-quality\nberries; the Florida Belle, a disease-resis-\ntant variety with red, conical fruit; and\nthe Sequoia, with high-quality fruit that\ntends to be soft when ripe.\nStrawberries, which are native to\nEurope and North and South America,\nthrive in temperate zones throughout the\nworld and have a history more than 2,000\nyears old.  Wild strawberries, which are\nsmaller but more fragrant and flavorful\nthan cultivated varieties, grew in Italy as\nearly as the 3rd century B.C.  American\nIndians are known to have cultivated\nstrawberries by the 17th century to eat\nfresh and also dried and added to winter\nsoups.  They also used them medicinally,\nto make dyes, and as preservatives for\nother food.  In the early 18th century, the\nFrench developed larger strawberries by\ncrossing two wild varieties.  These plants\nare believed to be the source of the large\ncultivated strawberries we enjoy today.\nAlthough the source of the name\n“strawberry” is unknown, it may derive\nfrom the practice of placing straw around\nthe plants for protection, from the\nrunners that the plant sends out, or from\nthe Anglo-Saxon verb “to strew,” which\ncould have led to names such as strea-\nbergen, streberie, straibery, and, finally,\nthe English strawberry.\nStrawberries prefer well-drained,\nmoist, sandy soils, warm days, and cool\nnights.  The flowers, usually white but\nsometimes pink, give rise to berries that\nripen about a month after the blossoms\nform.  Most varieties of strawberry con-\ntinue to bloom and produce fruit\nthroughout the harvest season.  The fruit\nis picked at the peak of its freshness and\ndoes not ripen after harvesting.  Because\nstrawberries are easily bruised, they are\ncarefully hand-picked, sorted, and packed\nin the field and then rushed to cooling\nfacilities.  They are stored for only 24\nhours before being shipped in refrigerated\ntrucks to markets.\nIn California, where strawberries have\nbeen cultivated since the early 1900s, the\nfruit grows 10 months of the year, from\nJanuary through November; the peak\nseason falls between April and June.  In\nfact,  California produces more than 80\npercent of all domestic strawberries, about\n1 billion tons per year.  In Florida, the\nsecond-largest producing state, straw-\nberries are grown in the winter months\nonly, and Oregon cultivates berries mostly\nfor frozen products.  Although other states\nproduce strawberries, they usually are\navailable only in the warm summer months\nfor local markets.  Some strawberries are\nalso imported from Mexico and New\nZealand.\nThe freshness and flavor of strawber-\nries can be preserved if they are not\nwashed until just before they are to be eaten.\nFresh strawberries are most frequently\nserved sliced over small shortcakes, topped\nwith whipped cream; used as a garnish\nfor appetizer and cheese platters; or added\nto fresh fruit tarts. Whole, long-stemmed\nstrawberries dipped in chocolate make an\nelegant dessert.  Strawberries are also\nadded to rhubarb pies and made into pre-\nserves. Mixed in a blender with low-fat\nmilk or yogurt, honey, and other fruits,\nthey make a refreshing, nutritious shake.\nStrawberries are high in vitamin C.\nThe sweet, juicy, bright-red strawberry\nis actually not really a fruit in the\nbotanical sense but a swelling of the\nplant’s stalks that occurs after the flowers\nFruits\n165\nNutrient Content\nBlack-\nBlue-\nCran-\nCurrant\nElder-\nGoose-\nMul-\nRasp-\nStraw-\nberry\nberry\nberry\n(red)\nberry\nberry\nberry\nberry\nberry\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n37\n41\n23\n31\n53\n33\n30\n30\n22\nWater (%) \n86\n85\n87\n84\n80\n88\n88\n87\n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n4\n2\n2\n2\n5\n3\n1\n4\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n9\n10\n6\n8\n13\n8\n7\n7\n5\nProtein (grams)\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n23\n4\n3\n18\n28\n19\n27\n14\n10\nIron\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\nZinc\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nManganese\n1\n0\n0\n0\n–\n0\n–\n1\n0\nPotassium\n141\n65\n34\n154\n203\n149\n136\n93\n120\nMagnesium\n14\n4\n2\n7\n4\n8\n13\n11\n7\nPhosphorus\n15\n7\n4\n25\n28\n20\n27\n7\n14\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A (RE)\n12\n7\n2\n7\n44\n22\n2\n8\n2\nVitamin C\n15\n9\n6\n23\n26\n21\n25\n15\n41\nThiamin\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.1\n0\n0\n0\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.1\n0.1\n0\nNiacin\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n0\nFolate (μg)\n24\n5\n1\n4\n4\n5\n4\n16\n13\nVitamin E\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient value is not available.\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup \n166\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nOn the island of Maui in Hawaii, almost\n100 varieties of breadfruit, called “ulu,”\nare grown at Kahanu Gardens of the\nNational Tropical Botanical Garden.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nNative to the Pacific, particularly Polynesia\nand southeast Asia, the beautiful, smooth-\nbarked breadfruit tree grows to about 60\nfeet tall, with dark-green, palmate leaves\nup to 3 feet long.

The fruit\nwas brought to Florida from Panama via\nChile in the late 1800s. It is cultivated in\nFlorida and in California and is mostly\nrecognized for its ornamental value.\nAccording to ancient Chinese beliefs, a\nflourishing calamondin tree will bring\ngood luck to the household.  Unlike\nmany of its cousins in the citrus family, it\nis able to withstand mild cold tempera-\ntures. However, it thrives best in filtered\nsunlight and acidic soil at temperatures\nranging between 60° and 85° Fahrenheit.\nExcess moisture may damage its roots.\nThe dwarf tree produces very decorative,\nfragrant white flowers about an inch in\ndiameter, and it is valued as an ornamen-\ntal houseplant whose beauty lasts through\nthe year.  Its golden fruits can take up to\n12 months to mature and ripen.\nUses\nAside from its use as a garnish, cala-\nmondin is appreciated for its distinctive\nflavor.  The entire fruit, except for the\nseeds, can be consumed.  The fruit is best\nused within a week of  harvesting when it\nis still green.  Once it reaches deep yellow,\nit must be kept refrigerated to retain its\ncrispness and aroma. The fruit can be\nkept refrigerated up to 2 weeks.  This tiny\nfruit releases a highly acidic (almost caustic\nin taste) juice that works wonderfully as\na flavor enhancer  in a variety of dishes,\nfrom fish to noodles, soups, sauces, and\ndesserts. It also is used to make preserves.\nCalamondin juice serves as a base in many\nbeverages.\nCalamondin, also called “acid orange,” is a citrus fruit resembling a miniature\norange. It is a slightly oblong fruit about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.  The edible\npeel is smooth and tender and varies in color, ranging from yellowish green when\npremature to deep orange when ripe.  The flesh \nis juicy and orange and forms a segmented\ncrown around a small semi-hollow\naxis.  Calamondin contains a \nsmall number of seeds with \ngreen cotyledons.  The fruit \nis extremely sour but can \nalso be very bitter if picked \nbefore maturity.\nVarieties\nCalamondin is one of several hundred\nsubspecies of the genus Citrus.  It belongs\nto the family that includes lemons, limes,\nand kumquats. Cross-breeders believe\nthat it may be a hybrid of lime and man-\ndarin.  Others think it resembles a cross\nbetween the kumquat and the tangerine.\nIt is a close relative to the “kalamansi,”\nalso known as “musk lime,” which is used\nextensively in southeast Asian cuisine.\n168\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nTwo types of carambola are available:  the\ntart varieties and the sweet.

The fruit can be refrigerated in a\nmoderately humid area for about 3 weeks\nwithout damage or loss in fruit quality.\nWhen transferred to room temperature,\nfruits that have been picked before fully\nripe will turn yellow.  The sweet variety is\ngenerally eaten fresh, either whole or sliced.\nJuiced, preserved, dried, and canned ver-\nsions also are available.  The tart variety\nis used for making jams.  Before the fruit\nis served, the darker edge of the cells (or\nridges) should be removed and the fruit\nsliced crosswise.  The star-shaped sections\nare often used as garnishes for light summer\nentrées.  Rubbing a very small amount\nof salt onto the exposed flesh will prevent\nthe darkening that is caused by exposure\nto the air.  Other uses for the fruit include\npickling, adding it to salsa and salads,\npuréeing it for chutney, grilling it on\nskewers with seafood or chicken, using it\nas a garnish, and adding it to puddings,\ntarts, stews, and curries.

Its length ranges from 2 to \n6 inches with four to six prominent vertical lobes \n(cells) that result in star-shaped slices when cut \ncrosswise.  The flesh is light to dark yellow, \ncrunchy, juicy, and translucent.  The flavor \nresembles a blend of the flavors of many\nfruits.

The large, dark-green leaves\nhave velvety undersides and prominent\nveins. Cherimoya trees can grow in a wide\nrange of soil types but seem to grow best\nin well-drained, medium soil of moderate\nfertility. They do not flourish in hot, humid\nclimates, but prefer sunny exposure, light\ncoastal air, and cool nights. The trees can\ntolerate a light frost and require some\nchilling to produce well.\nCherimoyas generally are propagated\nby seed or grafting.  A tree grown from\nseed will produce fruit after 5 or 6 years,\nbut grafted trees will produce fruit in 3\nto 4 years.  The greenish brown flowers\nof the cherimoya tree open first as female\nflowers for 36 hours, and later as male\nflowers.  However, they usually are hand-\npollinated.  The fruits are clipped from\nthe tree while they are still firm, because\nthey usually crack open and decay if left\nto ripen on the tree.\nUses\nBecause the pulp of the cherimoya is the\nonly edible portion, the peel and seed\nmust be removed before eating.  Unripe\nfruits can be ripened at room tempera-\nture.

Disagreement\neven exists about the origins of the name\n“grapefruit.”  One theory holds that it\nwas so named because the growing fruits\nresemble a cluster of grapes.\nThe grapefruit tree is a large evergreen\nwith dark, glossy, green leaves.  The grape-\nfruit prefers warmer climates and there-\nfore thrives best in the southern states.\nToday, Florida, Texas, and California\nsupply 90 percent of the world’s grape-\nfruit.

Although modern farm\nmachinery is used, some aspects of grape\ngrowing, or “viticulture,” are still done\nby hand.  Grapevines generally are prop-\nagated from grafts and cuttings rather\nthan from seed.  Five years is required for\na young grapevine to reach optimal pro-\nduction.  The woody vines must be staked\nto support the weight of the fruit.  Like\nmost fruit, grapes develop sugar as they\nripen, but they do not get sweeter after\nthey are picked.  Domestic grapes are\navailable from May through January or\nMarch, and imported grapes fill the gap\nduring late winter and spring.\nUses\nWhen selecting grapes, it is best to choose\nthose with a powdery-looking coating\ncalled “bloom.”  Green grapes should have\na slight gold cast, and dark grapes should\nbe uniform in color.  Grapes can be refrig-\nerated in a perforated plastic bag for up\nto 3 days. Table grapes such as Thompson\nMore grapes are grown than any other fruit in the world.

Strong trel-\nlising is necessary to support the size and\nweight of the plant when it is heavy with\nfruit.  The plants are dioecious, meaning\nthat male and female flowers develop on\ndifferent plants.  Thus, both male and\nfemale plants are needed for pollination.\nThe male plant does not produce fruit\nbut is sometimes used as a landscape dec-\noration because of its attractive flowers.\nKiwi is propagated by seeds, cuttings,\nand grafting.  Plants grown from cuttings\nor grafting take 1 year to produce fruit,\nwhereas vines propagated from seeds need\nmore time to mature and will produce\nfruit only after 2 to 3 years.  The plants\nrequire a long, frost-free growing season of\nabout 220 days for fruit ripening.  In\nCalifornia, the vines leaf in mid to late\nMarch and flower in May.

The pulp is pale \ngreen and is divided into 10 to 12 segments.  \nThe fruit has an aromatic taste but is too \ntart for eating out of hand. Its \nprimary use is to flavor \nother foods.\nVarieties\nThe many varieties of lime are nearly iden-\ntical in shape and appearance, but their\ndegree of acidity ranges from nearly\nneutral to extremely tart.  Among the\nhigh-acidity varieties are the small Mexican\nor Key lime, which has a sweet-tart taste.\nThe Tahitian lime comes in two strains, the\nPersian and Bears, all of unknown origin\nand nearly seedless.  These limes are grown\ncommercially in California and the coastal\nareas of Florida.

In 1903,\ntheUnited States Department of Agriculture\nintroduced the Chinese varieties of the\nlongan to Florida, and cultivation was\nbrought to Bermuda, Cuba, Puerto Rico,\nand Hawaii.  Today the longan is cultivated\nthroughout southeast Asia, in Central\nAmerica, and in the United States, where\nthe leading producers are Hawaii and\nFlorida.\nThe longan tree is a tropical to sub-\ntropical evergreen that can reach heights\nof up to 35 feet and widths to 45 feet.\nAlthough it prefers warm weather, the\nmature tree can tolerate brief exposure to\ntemperatures slightly below freezing.  The\ntree’s large leaves, up to a foot long, create\na dense, dark green foliage.  The tree\nblooms once a year with small, greenish\nyellow flowers.  The fruit develops in\nlarge, drooping clusters over about a 4-\nmonth period.  Even in the best growing\nconditions, fruit yield can be erratic.\nThe tree is propagated easily from\nseed, but because the tree must be 6 to 9\nyears old before bearing fruit (and even\nthen the quality is not predictable),\ncommercial propagation is usually accom-\nplished by air layering or grafting.\nUses\nThe longan is particularly popular in\nChina and southeast Asia, where it is\neaten fresh, dried, and canned.  The fruit\nalso stores well when frozen.  Because it\nis similar to the lychee, the longan can be\nused as a substitute in a variety of recipes.\nIn addition to providing delicious fruit,\nthe longan tree is an attractive addition\nto the garden, furnishing significant shade\nbecause of the length and density of its\nfoliage.\nLONGAN\nFamily  Sapindaceae\nScientific name Nephelium \nlongana\nCommon name longan\n♥High in vitamin C\nNutrient composition\nLongans are high in vitamin C.

Because cooking softens\nthe fruit and enhances its sweetness, nec-\ntarines are sometimes used in recipes that\nrequire baking, grilling, broiling, or\npoaching.

Olive trees bloom in\nMay, producing delicate cream-colored\nflowers, and the fruit is harvested from\nearly autumn to winter.  The Mediterranean\ncountries account for 95 percent of the\nworld’s olive cultivation.\nUses\nFresh olives contain tannins that render\nthem inedible; hence, all olives are\nprocessed or cured.  Table olives are\nprocessed by four methods.  With the\nSpanish method, unripe olives are fer-\nmented in brine for up to 7 months.  The\nbrine-soaking method is used on Italian\nand Greek olives such as Kalamatas, often\nadded to Greek salads.  Brief soaking (1\nto 2 weeks) produces crunchy olives, and\nprolonged soaking (a month or more)\nresults in chewier, sweeter olives.  A third\nmethod, typically used in Greece, involves\npacking and aging olives in salt or oil,\nwhich produces olives with shriveled skins\nFruits\n193\nThe orange is a reddish yellow, round fruit of the citrus family with a rich, juicy\npulp that varies in flavor from very sweet to sour.  The pulp of the orange is a\nsegmented ball, each segment wrapped tightly in a thin semi-opaque membrane\ncalled the albedo.  The flesh is encased in a sturdy, glossy skin composed \nof two layers.  The outer layer, called the zest, has a \npungent but pleasant fragrance, and the inner \nlayer, called the pith, is white, spongy, \nand bitter.  Although some varieties \nare seedless, most have seeds.\nVarieties\nThere are two common types of oranges:\nthe sweet orange, which is the more\ncommon, and the sour orange.  The sour\norange has a thick skin and is used pre-\ndominantly in making marmalades and\nliqueurs.  The sweet varieties are prized\nboth for eating and for their juice.  The\ntwo most common varieties of sweet\norange are the navel and the Valencia.\nThe navel orange has a thick, easy-to-peel\nskin, is seedless, and has a mild flavor.\nValencia oranges are more commonly\nknown as juice oranges because of their\nabundant juice content and thinner skin,\nwhich makes them easy to squeeze.  Other\nsweet oranges include the blood orange,\nwith its red pulp, and the Jaffa, imported\nfrom Israel.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe name orange, “naranga” in Sanskrit,\ncomes from the Tamil “naru” and means\ngood guide to quality because some\noranges are artificially colored to preserve\nshelf life and to enhance appeal and\nmarketability.  \nThe fruit is a great snack, although\nmost Americans consume oranges in the\nform of juice.

The largest producers of\npears today are China, Italy, Russia, and\nthe United States. California, Oregon,\nand Washington account for 98 percent of\nthe United States pear crop.  Pears are\nclosely related to apples in that both are\npome fruits (fruits with a distinct seed-\ncontaining core) and members of the rose\nfamily.  However, pear trees tend to be\nmore upright than apple trees (commer-\ncially grown trees are usually pruned to\nabout 20 feet high).  Ideal growing con-\nditions require a combination of warm\ndays, cool nights, rich volcanic soil, and\nample water.  Between 100 and 170 days\nare required from bloom to harvest.  Like\nbananas and avocados, pears are usually\npicked before they are fully ripe, because\nthey do not ripen well on the tree.\nPears are bell-shaped fruits, wide and round at the bottom, narrowing toward the\nstem; however, some varieties are nearly round.  Pears range in size from less than\n1 inch to 3 inches in diameter.  They have a smooth, thin skin that may be green,\nyellow, brown, or red when ripe.  The juicy, sweet flesh is usually white with a\ntinge of yellow.  The flesh of some pears is sandy in \ntexture.  Enclosed within the flesh is a cartilaginous \ncore that contains as \nmany as 10 seeds.\n198\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nPersimmons are divided into two types,\nbased on flavor and texture.

Unlike\nmost other fruits (with the exception of\nsome melons), pineapples do not have a\nreserve of starch that converts to sugar after\nharvest. Instead, the starch is stored in the\nstem of the plant and enters the fruit as\nsugar just before it ripens completely.  As\na result, the fruit will not become any\nsweeter after harvest, so growers must\nallow the pineapple to ripen on the plant\nto maximize the sugar and juice content\nof the fruit.\nUses\nWhen selecting a pineapple, choose one\nwith fresh, green leaves and no obvious\nsoft or brown spots, especially at the base.\nWhen ripe, the rind can be dark green,\nyellow, or reddish yellow; however, most\npineapples on the market are already ripe,\nregardless of their color, and should be\nrefrigerated in a plastic bag after purchase.\nFreshly cut pineapple may be kept, sealed\nairtight, in the refrigerator for up to a week.\nPineapples are consumed fresh and\ncanned and as juice.  Fresh pineapple\nThe pineapple is a cylindrical fruit that is approximately \n4 to 8 inches in diameter and can reach a length of \n12 inches, weighing up to 10 pounds.  It has a \nwaxy, tough rind covering a juicy flesh that \nsurrounds a fibrous core.  The flesh \nand core range from nearly white \nto yellow, and the flavor is \na combination of apples, \nstrawberries, and peaches.\nPineapple\nVarieties\nThree varieties of fresh pineapple are avail-\nable in the United States.  The popular\nSmooth Cayenne, from Hawaii, weighs 3\nto 5 pounds, and its flesh ranges from pale\nyellow to yellow.  The Red Spanish is nearly\nsquare and has a tougher shell that makes\nit well suited to shipping.  Its flesh is pale\nyellow and has a pleasant aroma.  Weighing\nup to 10 pounds, the Sugar Loaf is the\nlargest of the three varieties.  Its white flesh\nlacks the woodiness often found in the core\nof other varieties.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe pineapple is indigenous to southern\nBrazil and Paraguay.  Columbus encoun-\ntered the pineapple on his 1493 journey\nto the Caribbean and took it back to\nEurope, from where it spread to many\nother parts of the world on ships that\ncarried it as protection against scurvy, a\ndisease caused by a deficiency of vitamin\nC.  The name is derived from piña, a\nname given by the Spanish, who thought\nthat the fruit resembled a pinecone.\nPineapples do not grow on trees. They\ngrow on a plant that is technically an herb,\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup, diced, \nraw (78 g)\nVarieties\nOf the more than 1,000 varieties of plums\nin Europe and 140 in North America,\nabout 20 dominate the commercial supply\nof plums in the United States, most of\nwhich are Japanese or European varieties.\nThe Japanese types have juicy yellow or\nreddish flesh and skin colors that range\nfrom crimson to black-red.  The Santa\nRosa and Red Beaut are two of the more\npopular Japanese varieties.  European\nplums, or Prunus domestica, are smaller,\ndenser, and less juicy than their Japanese\ncounterparts.  Their skin color is always\nblue or purple, and their pits are usually\nfreestone, which means that they separate\neasily from the flesh.  Among the better-\nknown varieties are Italian, President,\nEmpress, Stanley, and Tragedy.  In the\nUnited States, the bulk of European\nplums are grown in the Pacific Northwest,\nbut some varieties are successfully culti-\nvated in the eastern states.  With its firmer\nflesh and higher sugar and acid contents,\nthe European variety is best suited for\nprunes (also called dried plums).  The\nmost common variety of plum used for\nprunes is the California French, also known\nas d’Agen.  A few varieties of prune plums\nare sold fresh and are called fresh prunes\nor purple plums.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nAlthough plums are native to several tem-\nperate regions around the world, including\nNorth America, early colonists brought\nEuropean varieties with them that sup-\nplanted native American plums.  In the\nlate 19th century, dozens of varieties from\nEurope and Asia were cultivated in the\nUnited States, primarily in California.\nOne of the most influential plum breeders\nwas the famed horticulturist Luther\nBurbank, who in 1907 developed the\nSanta Rosa variety, which now accounts\nfor about a third of the total domestic\ncrop.  The California French plum is a\ndescendant of the first prune plums\nbrought to California from France by\nLouis Pellier in the 1850s.  The domestic\nplum season extends from May to\nOctober, beginning with the Japanese vari-\neties and ending with the European types.\nToday, about 70 percent of the world’s\nprune supply and nearly 100 percent of\ndomestic prunes come from California.\nUses\nThe majority of plums are eaten fresh.\nPlums are a nutritious, low-calorie food\nthat can be eaten out of hand or added\nto fruit salads, baked goods, compotes,\nand meat dishes.  Plums also can be made\ninto jams, purées, or sauces.

The tree bears\nsmall, ball-shaped white flowers borne\non slender stalks at the leaf bases.  A\nresinous sap called “chicle” was once\ncollected from sapodilla tree trunks for\nmaking chewing gum. This practice has\nlargely been replaced by the use of syn-\nthetic ingredients.  The mature sapodilla\ntree can yield from 2,000 to 3,000 fruits\nin a single year.  Because the fruits are\neasily perishable and fragile, they do not\nship well and therefore are relatively\nunknown outside their areas of origin.\nUses\nBecause the high tannin and latex contents\nof unripe fruits make them astringent and\nunpalatable, sapodillas should be eaten\nonly when ripe.  Unripe sapodilla fruits\nshould be left to ripen at room tempera-\nture and refrigerated after ripening.  The\nsapodilla is best eaten raw and chilled, by\ncutting in half and spooning the pulp out\nof the skin.  It can be added to salads or\ndesserts such as ice cream and sorbet.  In\nMalaysia, the fruit is stewed with lime\njuice or fried with ginger.  In India, it is\neaten as a dried fruit.\nThe sapodilla is nearly round and about 2 to 4 inches in diameter.

Its rough, fragrant rind is generally orange or red-orange,\nthin, and loose on the fruit, so that it peels \nvery easily.  Inside, numerous fibers \nloosely hold the 8 to 15 easily separated \nsegments, or carpels, that contain the \njuice sacs and white seeds.  The center is \nhollow. Although the terms “tangerine” \nand “mandarin orange” are sometimes used \ninterchangeably, tangerines actually are a \nsubgroup of the mandarin.\nwere crossed with other citrus fruits, pro-\nducing numerous hybrids such as the\ntangelo (a cross between a tangerine and\na grapefruit) and the tangor (a hybrid of\na tangerine and an orange).\nThe tangerine tree is an evergreen that\ngrows to a height of about 10 feet.  The\nfive-petaled tangerine blossoms are white\nand fragrant.  It takes 6 to 10 months\nfrom the time the blooms appear until\nthe fruit is ready for harvest.  Tangerines\ngrow year-round in warmer climates, and\nthey are a traditional Christmas or New\nYear treat in some parts of the world.\nUses\nTangerines are always picked when they\nare ripe, so they are ready for immediate\nconsumption.  Fruits should be heavy for\ntheir size and free of bruises.  Color is not\na reliable indicator of the quality of tan-\ngerines. The fruit is most often eaten as a\nsnack or dessert or used in green salad or\nfruit salad.  Tangerine slices also make an\nattractive garnish for cakes and other\ndesserts.

Honey tangerines, with\ntheir slightly green-tinged peel, are true to\ntheir name.  They have a high sugar\ncontent and a rich taste.  The Fallglo is a\nlarge tangerine with dark-orange rind and\nflesh.  Two smaller sized varieties are the\nClementine, also called the Algerian tan-\ngerine, and the Sunburst, which has a\nthin skin and deep-orange flesh.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nTangerines are native to China, but today\nthey are grown all over the world.  In the\nUnited States, the leading producers are\nCalifornia, Arizona, and Florida.\nThe name “tangerine” is derived from\nthe ancient, walled Moorish town of\nTangier in northern Morocco, where the\nfruit grows in abundance.

Some fragrant, highly flavored vegetables,\nsuch as scallions, garlic, ginger, parsley, basil, oregano, fenugreek, and dill, are really used as herbs\nand spices in sparing amounts as flavorings for other foods.  Only a few of these “vegetables” are\ndescribed in this section.  Other herbs and spices are discussed on pages 363 to 375. \nSome plant foods that we consider vegetables are, botanically, fruits (for example, avocado,\nsquash, cucumber, olives, tomatoes, and eggplant), that is, edible flesh surrounding seeds.  Nevertheless,\nthe term “vegetable” has come to denote plant foods eaten as side dishes or used in the preparation\nof any part of the meal except dessert.  Vegetables tend to be less sweet than foods considered fruits.\nIn addition, some foods that are served as vegetables are really grains (corn), legumes (green beans,\nlima beans, peas), or fungi (mushrooms, truffles).  So what is a vegetable, really? A vegetable is essen-\ntially any edible part of the plant (leaves, roots or tubers, and stalks) except, in most cases, the fruit.\nMultiple parts of some plants are eaten as separate vegetables with very different nutrient contents.\nThe most common example is beet roots and their greens.\nVegetables contribute significant amounts of vitamins, minerals, soluble and insoluble fiber,\nand other phytonutrients to our diets.  The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise us to eat a\nwide variety of vegetables and fruits every day, because the nutrient content varies considerably\nfrom one to another.  (For a discussion of the Dietary Guidelines and the 5 a Day program, see\nChapter 1, page 8.)  With the exception of olives and avocados, which are really fruits, few vegetables,\nby themselves, provide significant amounts of fat.  The fat provided by olives and avocados is high\nin monounsaturated fatty acids, which may help prevent heart disease (see Chapters 2 and 3).  \nTo assist you in menu planning, the following section provides information regarding the nutrient\ncontent of many vegetables.\nThe tables of nutrient values are based on serving sizes specified by the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid.  Nutrient values are rounded (milligrams and micrograms\ntend to be rounded to one decimal point, grams are rounded to whole numbers).  Nutrient\nclaim statements listed beneath the common name of each vegetable are based on the\nserving size specified and the definitions in Chapter 4 (see sidebar:\nNutrient Claims, page 92).  For example, asparagus is consid-\nered a good source of vitamin C, because it provides about 18\npercent of the Daily Value for vitamin C.  A food that is high\nin a particular nutrient provides 20 percent or more of the\nDaily Value for that nutrient per serving.\nSee the Appendix, Nutrients in Foods, page 434, and\nPhytochemical Contents of Selected Foods, page 484, for a\nmore complete listing of nutrient and phytonutrient contents\nof selected vegetables.\n212\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n14\nWater (%) \n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n-\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n3\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n138\nIron\n2\nZinc\n1\nManganese\n1\nPotassium\n423\nMagnesium\n36\nPhosphorus\n48\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n183 RE\nVitamin C\n27\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0.1\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\nFolate\n37 μg\nVitamin E\n–\nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient\nvalue is not available.\nSERVING\nSIZE: 1/2 cup leaves, \ncooked (66 g)\nAMARANTH\nNutrient Composition\nAmaranth is a nutrient-dense food.  One-\nhalf cup of cooked leaves is high in\nvitamin A and vitamin C and is a good\nsource of calcium.  \nAmaranth is cultivated as both a vegetable and a cereal grain.  The upright\nherbaceous plant usually reaches 6 to 7 feet in height but may grow to 13 feet \nin favorable environments.  The foliage varies in shape and color, although \nthe leaves of most varieties are large, broad, and dark green with deep \npurplish veins.  The flowers are small, green, and clover-like.  \nThe leaves from most varieties are edible and are delicious \nwhen cooked.  The tiny grain is very nutritious.  \n(See Grains, page 272, for a discussion \nof the grain.)\nAmaranths are hot weather plants  that\nthrive best in well-fertilized, well-irrigated\nraised beds in sunny areas.  Amaranth\ngreens are harvested 4 to 6 weeks after the\nplanting season.  They are transported to\nthe market packed in ice and are sold in\nbunches.  Once considered a weed in the\nUnited States, amaranth is now consumed\nas a vegetable green.\nUses\nYoung amaranth leaves are preferred for\ncooking.  The leaves wilt easily and have\na very short shelf life.  They must be\nrefrigerated or kept in ice water to retain\ntheir freshness and crispness.

The green variety is\nthe only one grown on a commercial scale\nin the United States, whereas the white is\npreferred in Europe. White asparagus is\nproduced by banking soil against the plant\nto keep out sunlight, which otherwise\nwould turn the stalks green.  Also available,\nalthough not common, is a violet variety,\nwith pinkish purple shoots and tips.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nAsparagus was first cultivated in Greece\nabout 2,500 years ago.  In fact, the name\nasparagus is Greek for “stalk” or “shoot.”\nThe ancient Greeks believed that asparagus\nhad medicinal qualities and could cure\ntoothaches and bee stings.  The cultiva-\ntion of asparagus was adopted by the\nRomans, who carried it throughout\nEurope and Great Britain.  From there,\nits popularity spread to the rest of the\nworld.  Traditionally, asparagus was a\nNorthern Hemisphere crop, but today it\nis cultivated worldwide.  The United\nStates is the world’s largest supplier of\nasparagus, with most cultivation con-\ncentrated in California.\nThe asparagus plant is a perennial but\nrequires three seasons to mature.  In its\nfirst season, a crown forms with 6 inches\nof root.  In its second season, the crown\ndevelops into a fern.  Asparagus can be\nharvested in its third season, but the plant\ndoes not reach its prime until 6 to 8 years\nof age.  At peak age, an asparagus field\ncan yield up to 2 tons per acre.  Because\nits growing season is short and it must be\nharvested by hand, asparagus can be expen-\nsive. Asparagus appears in American\nmarkets as early as February, when the\nfirst California crops are harvested, but\nthe peak season in the West is from late\nApril to late May and, elsewhere in the\nUnited States, from May through July.\nThroughout the rest of the year, fresh\nasparagus may be available from Mexico\nand South America.\nUses\nAsparagus stalks of similar width with\ntightly closed tips should be selected.\nYoung asparagus is thinner and generally\nmore tender.

Bamboo grown in the United\nStates is almost exclusively the cold-hardy\nPhyllostachys species, most of which are\ninvasive.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nBamboo is native to China, Japan, southeast\nAsia, India, Africa, South America, and\nparts of Mexico. Although bamboo shoots\nhave been an important vegetable in Asian\ndiets for thousands of years, Asian-grown\nbamboo is mostly consumed locally, with\nonly small quantities processed for export.\nBamboo is still a rare vegetable in Western\ncountries, used exclusively in Oriental\ndishes.  However, Europe and the United\nStates are beginning to develop bamboo\ncrops.\nBamboo grows by sending out new\nrhizomes (underground, horizontal stems)\nfrom which new shoots emerge.  The con-\nstant appearance of new shoots and leaves\ngives the plant its evergreen appearance.\nThe nutrients made by the leaves are stored\nin the rhizomes and then converted into\nthe following year’s new growth.  Because\nlarge crops occur in alternate years, growers\nmaintain plants of various ages.  To keep\nthe shoots white, soil is sometimes piled\nagainst new growth areas to prevent them\nfrom developing chlorophyll.  \nNations that export bamboo shoots\nmay harvest cultivated plantations or native\nforests.  Unfortunately, lack of regulation\nhas allowed excessive harvesting, which\nhas led to a decline in some native forests.\nIn contrast, because many hardy bamboo\nspecies spread uncontrollably, U.S. home\ngardeners who want to grow bamboo\nshould construct an underground barrier\nwall to prevent its spread.\nUses\nThe tenderest shoots are those about 6\ninches or less in height.  Fresh shoots\nshould be stored in cold water for no\nmore than 2 days, or wrapped tightly in\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n7\nWater (%) \n95\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n1\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n7\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n320\nMagnesium\n2\nPhosphorus\n12\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n0\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\nFolate\n1 μg\nVitamin E\n–\nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient\nvalue is not available.\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup, cooked (60 g)\nBamboo\nFamily Graminaceae\nScientific name Phyllostachys \nspecies, Bambusa species\nCommon name bamboo\n♥A source of potassium\nVegetables\n217\nBeets\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup\nsliced\n1/2 cup \nbeets,\ngreens,\ncooked\ncooked\n(85 g)\n(72 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n37\n19\nWater (%) \n87\n89\nDietary fiber (grams)\n2\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n8\n4\nProtein (grams)\n1\n2\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n14\n82\nIron\n1\n1\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n259\n655\nMagnesium\n20\n49\nPhosphorus\n32\n30\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n3 RE\n367 RE\nVitamin C\n3\n18\nThiamin\n0\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0\n0.2\nNiacin\n0\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\n0.1\nFolate\n68 μg\n10 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \n0\nFamily Chenopodiaceae\nScientific name Beta vulgaris\nCommon name beet\n♥Beets are a good source of folate\n♥Cooked beet greens are high in vitamin\nA (beta-carotene) and vitamin C and\nare a good source of riboflavin and\nmagnesium\nBeets are round, firm root vegetables with edible, leafy green tops.

The vegetable’s name is derived from its distinctive bitter\ntaste, the result of a high quinine content.  The bitterness increases as the melon\nmatures; young, green melons have a delicate, sour \nflavor, whereas older (yellow) ones are very \nbitter and acrid.  When fully mature, \nthe melon’s rind dries and splits \nlengthwise into three sections, \nrevealing the bright-red \narils that enclose \nthe seeds.  Bitter \nmelons are normally \neaten as immature fruits, \nbut some people prefer the \nbitter-tasting, more mature fruits.\nVarieties\nThe bitter melon is a variety of squash.\nA closely related variety, the balsam apple\n(Momordica balsamita), bears fruits similar\nto bitter melons except that they are egg-\nshaped and smaller, with smoother skin.\nBalsam apples, which have a taste similar\nto that of the bitter melon, are also cul-\ntivated, harvested, and prepared like the\nbitter melon.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nBitter melons originated in tropical India\nand have been cultivated for centuries\nthroughout Asia.\nThe bitter melon is an annual that\ngrows in tropical and subtropical areas.\nReaching up to 30 feet in length, the\nplant grows as a vine with tendrils that\nattach to plants or other objects for sup-\nport.  Although highly popular as a food\ncrop in India, China, and southeast Asia,\nbitter melons have  been introduced only\nrecently as a food item in U.S. markets.\nIn this country, bitter melons are often\ngrown on trellises and fences as decora-\ntive plants.\nUses\nBitter melons are available fresh from April\nthrough September in Asian markets and\nalso are sold canned or dried.  They can\nbe refrigerated in a plastic bag for up to a\nweek.  When buying bitter melons, choose\ngreen ones if a less bitter taste is desired\nor yellow ones for a stronger, more bitter\nflavor.  Before it is cooked, the fruit should\nbe cut lengthwise to remove the seeds and\nthe surrounding white fibers.  The skin\ncan be either left intact or removed.  Bitter\nmelons are always cooked before eating.\nIn India, bitter melons are combined with\npotatoes or lentils and seasoned with\ncumin and turmeric.  In China, they are\nsteamed or used as an ingredient in soup.\nThey can be thinly sliced and stir-fried\nwith eggs, meats, or other vegetables.\nStuffed with meat, shrimp, wood ears, and\nthin rice noodles, bitter melons can be\nbraised in a light broth to make a bitter-\nsweet soup.  The young leaves of the plant\ncan be boiled and stir-fried like greens or\nused fresh in salads.\nNutrient composition\nBitter melons are high in vitamin C.  They\nalso contain many phytochemicals, includ-\ning elasterol, lutein, and lycopene.  The\nleafy tips are a good source of vitamin A.\nVegetables\n219\nThe broccoli plant is a dark-green vegetable with a firm stalk and branching arms\nthat end in florets.  The name comes from the Latin word brachium, meaning\n“arm” or “branch,” or the Italian word broccolo, for \n“cabbage sprout.”  The edible portions are the florets \nand 6 to 8 inches of the supporting stem. \nBroccoli is closely related to cauliflower, \ncabbage, and Brussels sprouts.\nVarieties\nThe most common type of broccoli in the\nUnited States today is the sprouting, or\nItalian, green broccoli.  The light-green\nstalks are topped by umbrella-shaped clus-\nters of dark-green florets.  This variety is\nalso called the Calabrese, named after the\nItalian province in which it was first grown.\nBroccoli rabe, a distinct but related type,\nhas smaller florets and a stronger flavor.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nBroccoli dates back to the time of the\nRoman Empire, when it was cultivated\nfrom wild cabbage native to coastal Europe.\nIt was brought to the United States in the\nearly 1900s by Italian immigrants to\nnorthern California.  Currently, 90 percent\nof the domestic commercial market is\nsupplied by California producers.\nAlthough it is not a popular vegetable\nworldwide, broccoli began gaining pop-\nularity in the 1970s, when consumption\nper person increased from about a half\npound per year to the current 4 1/2\npounds.  Today, broccoli ranks 11th\namong leading U.S. vegetable crops.\nThe broccoli plant is an upright\nannual, able to reach a height of 3 feet,\nwith large spreading leaves.  Usually\ngrown from seed, broccoli is harvested\n80 to 120 days after planting.  The con-\nsumed portion of broccoli is actually a\ngroup of buds that are almost ready to\nflower.  Overmature broccoli is tough and\nwoody because the plant sugar is con-\nverted to lignin, a type of fiber that is not\nsoftened by cooking.\nUses\nBroccoli with the tiniest buds and the\ndarkest blue-green color should be\nselected.  Avoid those with a yellowish\ncast. Broccoli should be stored unwashed\nin an open bag in the refrigerator, because\nexcess moisture encourages the growth of\nmold.  Before use, broccoli should be rinsed\nthoroughly under cold running water to\nremove any dirt.  Broccoli can be con-\nsumed raw as an appetizer with dip or in\nsalads, or it can be cooked in a variety of\nways.  Well-cooked broccoli should be\ntender enough to yield to a fork, yet remain\ncrisp and bright.  Because the florets tend\nBroccoli\nto cook faster than the stalks, stalks should\nbe split to expose more surface area, which\nensures even cooking.  The florets also\nmay be cut from the stalks and added\nafter the stalks have been cooking for 2\nto 3 minutes.  Broccoli can be boiled,\nsteamed, microwaved, stir-fried, or puréed\nand added to soups.\nNutrient composition\nBroccoli is high in vitamin A (beta-\ncarotene) and vitamin C.

The sprouts range from 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  As many\nas a hundred of these ball-like sprouts may grow in bunches from a single, long\nplant stalk that is usually between 2 and 4 feet in height.  Brussels sprouts are\nsimilar to the cabbage in flavor but are \nmilder and have a denser texture.\nVarieties\nAmong the common varieties of Brussels\nsprouts are the Noisette and Bedford\nFillbasket. The Rubine is a red-leafed\nvariety; the Mallard, Captain Marvel,\nPrince Marvel, Montgomery, and Jade\nCross are all hybrids. The Early Half Tal\nis another variety.  \nOrigin & botanical facts\nBrussels sprouts, named after the capital\nof Belgium, are one of the few vegetables\nthat originated in northern Europe.  They\nwere first cultivated in Belgium in the\n16th century, introduced to France and\nEngland in the 19th century, and probably\nbrought to North America by French\nsettlers, who grew them in Louisiana.  In\nthe United States, they are grown pri-\nmarily along the east and west coasts\nwhere summer daytime temperatures\naverage 65 degrees or less.  Brussels sprouts\nare grown from seed, and the first sprouts\nare ready to pick about 4 months after\nthe seeds are sown.  The plant  continues\nto produce sprouts for approximately 6\nweeks.  Brussels sprouts are very resistant\nto cold, and the tastiest sprouts are often\nthose that mature after the first fall frost.\nThey are usually available throughout the\nyear.  The peak season is from late August\nthrough March.  California is the major\nsupplier of Brussels sprouts in the United\nStates.\nUses\nBrussels sprouts are usually selected on\nthe basis of size and appearance.  Small,\ncompact, fresh sprouts that are bright\ngreen will have the freshest flavor and the\ncrispiest texture.  They may be stored in\na loosely closed plastic bag in the refrig-\nerator for up to 5 days.  Any wilted or\nyellow outer leaves should be removed\nand the stems of the sprouts trimmed,\nalthough not flush with the bottoms,\nbefore cooking.

Cabbage is an\ninexpensive vegetable that is easy to grow\nand stores well.  It is particularly popular\nin Germany, Austria, Poland, and Russia.\nIn the United States, the primary regions\nof cultivation are California, Florida,\nGeorgia, New York, and Texas.\nCabbage is propagated from seed\nsown first in a seedbed and then trans-\nplanted after 1 to 2 months.  Tall varieties\nmust be staked to prevent damage from\nwind or heavy rain.  Cabbage is a rela-\ntively slow-growing crop.  Some varieties\ntake up to 200 days to mature.

Cooked cabbage has\na strong flavor and mushy consistency\nwhen overcooked, but it can be prepared\nVarieties\nOf the hundreds of types of cabbage,\nthree are grown and sold in the United\nStates:  green, red, and savoy.  Green cabbage\nhas smooth, green outer leaves and pale\ninterior leaves.  The three most commonly\ngrown varieties of green cabbage are\nDanish, with very compact, round or oval\nheads, produced for sale in the late fall;\nDomestic, with looser heads of curled\nleaves; and Pointed, grown primarily in\nthe Southwest for the spring market, with\nsmall, conical heads and smooth leaves.\nRed cabbage has dark-red to purple leaves\nwith white veins.  Red cabbage has a\ntougher texture and a flavor that is similar\nto but slightly sweeter than that of the\ngreen variety.  Savoy cabbage has pale,\nyellow-green, crinkled leaves forming a\nless compact, more oblong head.  Its flavor\ntends to be milder than that of red or\ngreen cabbage.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe oldest accounts of cultivated cabbage\nappear in Greek literature and date from\nabout 600 B.C.  However, the cabbage\neaten by the early Greeks and Romans\nappears to have been a loose-leaved, non-\nheading type.  Modern compact-headed\nvarieties with overlapping leaves were\nso that its mild taste and crisp texture are\nretained.  Cabbage can be microwaved,\nsteamed, stir-fried, or added to soups and\nstews.  Individual cabbage leaves can be\nseparated and used to wrap a variety of\nstuffings, such as meats and rice or other\ngrains.  Seasonings that work well with\nboth raw and cooked cabbage include\ncaraway, dill, mustard, and curry.\nNutrient composition\nCabbage is high in vitamin C.

Colors range from\nwhite to yellow to crimson. A carrot may\nbe as short as 3 to 6 inches and as long as\nseveral feet.  However, most carrots on the\nU.S. market today are orange and 7 to 9\ninches long.  Mini-peeled carrots are cut\nfrom the smaller, sweeter “caropak” carrots,\nwhich have been grown tightly together\nespecially for this purpose.  Despite pack-\naging and labeling claims, mini-peeled\ncarrots are not baby carrots.  True baby\ncarrots are carrots harvested earlier than\nusual and do, in fact, look like miniature\ncarrots.  They are often sold with their green\ntops still on them in specialty food stores.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe first carrots, which were white, purple,\nand yellow, were cultivated in Afghanistan\nand then brought to the Mediterranean\narea.  Today's orange carrots descend from\nDutch-bred carrots and have been grown\nin the United States since colonial times.\nDomestically, California produces about\n60 percent of the United States crop, 25\npercent of which goes into the production\nof mini-peeled carrots.\nUses\nCarrots should be firm and brightly col-\nored from top to bottom.  Near the leafy\ncrown of the root, there may be a green-\nish tinge, but dark or black coloring is an\nindication of age.  Keeping carrots refrig-\nerated in moisture-retaining packaging\nwill preserve them for up to a month.\nThe green leaves should be twisted off\nbefore storage, because they wilt quick-\nly and draw moisture from the carrots.\nFruits that produce ethylene gas as they\nripen, such as apples or pears, should not\nbe stored in the same bag with carrots.\nWith the exception of beets, carrots\ncontain more sugar than any other veg-\netable. They are a satisfying snack when\neaten raw and are a tasty addition to a\nvariety of mixed dishes.  Grated raw\ncarrots may be added to fruit or vegetable\nsalads, mixed with peanut butter as a\nsandwich filling, or used in baking cakes,\nmuffins, or breads.  Cooked carrots\nenhance the flavor of casseroles, soups,\nand stews.  Puréed carrots may be used\nin cookies, puddings, and soufflés.\nThe carrot plant is a member of the parsley family,  characterized by light, feathery\nleaves.  Other members of this family include fennel, dill, and celery.  \nThe edible root of the plant is usually orange and shaped \nlike a long cylindrical cone. A fibrous channel or core \nruns the length of the vegetable; usually, the smaller \nthe core, the younger and sweeter the vegetable.\nVegetables\n223\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n83\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n20\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n8\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n140\nMagnesium\n11\nPhosphorus\n14\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n1 RE\nVitamin C\n11\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n14 μg\nVitamin E\n0\nCassava\nor stews.  West Indians cook bitter cassava\nwith brown sugar and spices to make a\ncondiment called cassareep, available in\nCaribbean markets.  In addition to its\nvaried uses in the human diet, cassava is\nused as animal feed and in many indus-\ntrial applications.\nNutrient Composition\nCassava is composed mostly of carbohy-\ndrate and is a major source of calories in\nThird-World countries.\nThe cassava is a root 2 to 3 inches in diameter and 6 to 12 inches long, covered\nwith a coarse, inedible brown skin. To help preserve the root, the skin is often\ncoated with a shiny film of wax. The flesh of the tuber is white with thin veins\nrunning through it and is potato-like in texture.\nFamily Euphorbiaceae\nScientific names Manihot esculenta Crantz\n(Manihot ultissima Phol [sweet];\nManihot aipi Phol [bitter])\nCommon name yuca, tapioca, manioc,\napple\ntemperatures fall below 50° Fahrenheit).\nMost cassava roots are harvested by hand,\nalthough Brazil has developed mechanical\nharvesters.  Because the roots are extremely\nsensitive to physical damage, harvesting\nmust be done carefully. \nTo increase the short shelf life of the\ncassava further, the leaves are removed 2\nweeks before harvest.  In addition to\ndipping the roots into wax, storing the\nnewly harvested roots in plastic bags\nextends the shelf life by 3 to 4 weeks. \nUses\nCassava should be refrigerated no more\nthan 4 days. The peeled cassava can be\nboiled and mashed, baked, or sliced and\nfried, identical to the cooking of potatoes.\nAlternatively, the peeled root can be\ngrated and the starch extracted to make\nbreads, crackers, pasta, and tapioca pearls\n(a commercial product used to make\npudding).  In Africa, the roots are\nfermented in water, after which they are\nmade into an alcoholic beverage; sun-\ndried for storage; or grated, formed into\na dough, and cooked alone or in soups\nVarieties\nUntil recently, the many varieties of cassava\nwere divided into two main categories:\nbitter and sweet.  Because the bitter root\ncontains substances that are converted to\ntoxic cyanide compounds when the root\nis cut, it must not be eaten raw; cooking\ndestroys these substances.  Although sweet\ncassava is believed to have low amounts of\nthese potential toxins, taste is not a reliable\npredictor of toxin content, and experts\nrecommend that all cassava be cooked.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe cassava originated in Brazil, Paraguay,\nand the Caribbean Islands, from where\nit was introduced to Africa and the Far\nEast.  Africa is now the leading producer,\nand cassava is an important dietary staple\nthroughout the continent. In the United\nStates, cassava is grown in Florida and is\nimported from Mexico, Central America,\nSouth America, and the Antilles.\nCassava is propagated from stem cut-\ntings.

The flower bud\nforms on a single stalk and is surrounded\nby large, heavy green leaves that protect it\nfrom the discoloring effect of sunlight.\nHeads are ready for harvest between 80\nand 110 days after transplantation. In the\nfield, many of the leaves are trimmed off,\nand the heads, which bruise easily, are\npacked gently for shipping, usually in\nplastic wrap that has been perforated to\nallow the escape of carbon dioxide, which\ncan discolor the head and cause an\nunpleasant taste.\nUses\nA cauliflower head should be unbruised,\nfirm, and uniformly cream-colored without\na trace of black, and it should be heavy\nfor its size.  It can be stored in perforated\nplastic vegetable bags in the refrigerator\ncrisper for several days.\nThe raw florets are tasty in salads, as a\ncrunchy appetizer with dips, or pickled.\nCauliflower can be boiled, steamed,\nmicrowaved, or baked.

Cauliflower also\nworks well on its own, seasoned with\nnutmeg, dillweed, chives, or almonds.\nCauliflower is available fresh and frozen,\nbut the processing required for freezing\ndestroys some nutrients and can turn the\nflorets watery in flavor and appearance.\nNutrient composition\nCauliflower is high in vitamin C.  As a\ncruciferous vegetable, cauliflower contains\nphytochemicals that may help prevent\ncancer.\nVarieties\nCauliflower falls into three types.  The\nmost commonly grown and sold is the\nwhite cauliflower, which has creamy curds\nand bright-green leaves.  The green variety\nis actually the hybrid broccoflower\ndeveloped about 10 years ago, which has\nbright lime-green curds.  Less commonly\nknown is the purple-headed cauliflower.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nCauliflower is native to the Mediterranean\nregion and Asia Minor, where it was\ncultivated more than 2,000 years ago.  By\nthe 16th century, its cultivation had\nspread throughout western Europe.  In\nthe United States, cauliflower did not\nbecome an important vegetable until the\nearly part of the 20th century.  Today it\nis grown in numerous states.  California\nand New York are the leading producers,\nand it is also grown in Arizona, Michigan,\nOregon, Florida, Washington, and Texas.\nCauliflower requires cool tempera-\nVegetables\n225\nCeleriac\nClosely related to celery, celeriac (also\ncalled celery root or celery knob) is a\nknobby, bulb-shaped root about the size\nof a baseball.  It has a rough brown skin\nand rootlets.  It has a crisp texture and a\nnutty flavor that resembles that of strong\ncelery or parsley.\nVarieties\nCeleriac is available in three varieties:\nIram, a medium-sized, globe-shaped root\nwith few side shoots; Marble Ball, a\nround, white root; and Tellus, a quick-\ngrowing, round root with brownish red\nleaf stems.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nA native of the Mediterranean region,\nceleriac is a popular vegetable in Europe,\nparticularly in France and Italy, but it is\nless well known in the United States. \nCeleriac is propagated from seed,\nusually sown in pots or greenhouses in\nearly spring, and then transplanted to the\nfield in May.  It requires a fertile soil that\nis rich in organic matter.  For a large corm\n(underground stem base) to develop, a\nlong growing season and plenty of water\nare required.  Thus, celeriac thrives in\nmoist, temperate climates.  In midsum-\nmer, the outer leaves are removed, and\nthe plant is mulched or fertilized to assist\ngrowth and moisture retention.  Lateral\nshoots also are removed to create a single\ncooked whole and then peeled, diced, or\npuréed and added to soups, stews, and\nstir-fries or eaten alone with a bit of butter\nor margarine and fresh herbs.  In Europe,\nceleriac is often added to mashed potatoes\nand served with butter or cream sauce.\nLike celery, the celeriac root as well as the\nstalks are often used as a seasoning.\nNutrient composition\nRaw celeriac is a good source of vitamin\nC and provides some potassium and\nphosphorus. \nFamily Umbelliferae\nScientific name Apium graveolens\nCommon name celeriac\n♥Raw celeriac is a good source of\nvitamin C and provides some\npotassium and phosphorus\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup, raw\n1/2 cup,\n(78 g)\ncooked (77 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n33\n21\nWater (%) \n88\n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n7\n5\nProtein (grams)\n1\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n34\n20\nIron\n0\n0\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n234\n134\nMagnesium\n16\n9\nPhosphorus\n90\n51\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n6\n3\nThiamin\n0\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\n0\nNiacin\n1\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\n0.1\nFolate\n6 μg\n3 μg\nVitamin E\n0\n–\nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient\nvalue is not available.\ngrowing point.

A\nbunch of celery is actually a single stalk consisting of separate ribs, and the most\ntender, inner ribs are called the hearts.  The crispness \nof celery comes from the rigidity of its \ncell walls and its high water \ncontent.  In fact, celery \nis mostly water, which \nmakes it low in calories \nand an ideal snack food.\nVarieties\nAlthough celery is available in many colors,\nmost of the celery grown in the United\nStates belongs to the green varieties, which\nrange in shade from pale to dark and are\nreferred to as Pascal.  One common green\nvariety is the American Green, also known\nas the Tall Utah or Greensnap, which does\nnot require blanching (the banking of soil\nagainst the plant to keep it from turning\ndark green upon exposure to sunlight).\nOther varieties of celery include the Giant\nPink, with pink or red stems and dark-\ngreen leaves; the Golden Self-Blanching,\nwith pale, golden-yellow leaves and golden\nstems; and the Ivory Tower, a fast-matur-\ning, self-blanching variety with pale leaves.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nWild celery is a biennial or annual herb\nnative to southern Europe, Asia, and Africa,\ngrowing in marshes along the muddy banks\nof tidal rivers or in other saltwater areas.\nAlthough it resembles domestic celery, it\nis smaller, with a stronger, more pungent\nodor and flavor.  Before the familiar milder,\nthick-stalked forms were cultivated, celery\nprobably was used solely as a seasoning and\nmedicinal herb.  Leafy cultivated varieties\nmay date back 2,000 years or more, but\nstalk celery seems to have been grown first\nin Italy in the 16th century.  In the 1690s,\nJohn Evelyn, an English diarist, described\ncelery as a new vegetable.  Today, celery is\ngrown in Great Britain, India, the United\nStates, and Canada.\nCelery requires a moist, rich soil for\ngood growth.  It is especially successful\nin low-lying, alkaline areas such as the\neastern regions of Florida and Great\nBritain.  Because of its high water content,\ncelery requires large amounts of mois-\nture; otherwise, the stalks become stringy\nand tough.  Celery is propagated from\nseeds so tiny that it takes more than a mil-\nlion of them to add up to a pound.  Most\ncommercially grown celery is planted in\nMarch or April, in greenhouses or\nseedbeds with controlled watering.\nAbout 2 months after sowing, when\nthe seedlings are 4 to 6 inches tall, they are\ntransplanted to fields.  Varieties that require\nblanching usually are planted in trenches\nto facilitate the banking of the soil against\nthe plants.  Three to 4 months after field\nplanting, celery is ready for harvesting.\nUses\nCelery that is light in color and shiny has\nthe best flavor.  Celery should be stored\nby the bunch in perforated plastic veg-\netable bags in the refrigerator crisper.\nCelery is a versatile vegetable.  Raw\ncelery adds crunch to chicken, seafood,\negg, potato, and green salads.  It is an\nexcellent snack food or appetizer.  Celery\nalso can be microwaved, stir-fried, braised,\nor steamed to serve as a main vegetable,\nbut it usually is combined with other veg-\netables or is included in stuffings for\npoultry and fish.

It resembles a summer squash or avocado in shape and appearance but has\ndeep, lengthwise ridges and a single, flat, nut-like \nseed.  The fruit can be variable in size, color, \ntexture, and flavor.  The skin of the fruit \ncan be smooth, deeply fissured, or \neven wrinkled and prickly.  Colors \nrange from light-green to almost \nwhite.  The opaque flesh has a \ncucumber-like texture and varies \nin color.  Once heated, the flesh \nbecomes somewhat translucent.  \nExcept for the seed, the entire fruit \nis edible.\nFamily Cucurbitaceae\nScientific name Sechium edule\nCommon name chayote\n♥A good source of vitamin C\nVarieties\nAlthough definite strains of chayote-pro-\nducing plants exist, distinctive varieties\nof the fruit are yet to be identified.\nHowever, the fruit is identified by a\nvariety of names.  In many places, it is\nrecognized as mango squash, chocho,\nchristophine, and choke.  In Louisiana,\nit is called mirliton, and in Florida it is\ncalled a vegetable pear.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nChayote is native to Mexico, Central\nAmerica, and the West Indies.  The fruit\nis believed to have been cultivated by\nthe Aztecs and Mayans long before\nColumbus arrived.  The name chayote is\nderived from the Mayan word “chayotli.”\nThe plant is now grown in South\nAmerica, North Africa, and in subtropical\nparts of southern Florida. The fruit grows\nabundantly from a fast-growing tropical\nclimbing vine that may reach up to 100\nfeet in a single season and is covered with\nlarge, heart-shaped, lobed leaves that\nmeasure 4 to 6 inches.  Ideal growing\nconditions include full sunlight, high\nmoisture levels, and rich, well-drained soil.\nUnder the proper conditions, some plants\ncan produce up to 100 fruits in a single\nseason.  The fruits must be harvested\nyoung or they will become tough.  Chayote\nis available year-round, but the peak\nseason is late summer through early fall. \nUses\nA firm, unblemished, clear-green chayote\nis the best choice. The chayote keeps up\nto 1 month stored uncovered in a cool,\ndry, dark place, or it can be stored in a\nperforated plastic bag in a refrigerator\nvegetable crisper for up to a week.\nThe chayote  is most easily prepared\nby peeling the fruit and microwaving or\nsteaming it for a few minutes.  Although\nvery young fruit can be prepared with the\nskin left on, more mature fruit should be\npeeled under running water to prevent\nbeing irritated by the sticky sap under the\nskin. Cooked chayote can be seasoned to\ntaste and eaten as is; sliced or diced and\nadded to other dishes such as salads in place\nof cucumbers; or prepared like french\nfries.  Chayote halves that are stuffed and\nbaked make a filling main dish.  The\nchayote can be substituted for many other\nfruits and vegetables in recipes.  A fully\nmature fruit may be used in place of pota-\ntoes in soups and purées.  The grated fruit\nalso is useful as a substitute for carrots\nand zucchini in breads and pastries.\nCooked, mashed, and seasoned with\nsweet spices, it resembles applesauce and\ncan be served as a light snack or dessert.\nThe leaves and stems of the chayote plant\nare used as a low-cost animal feed and\ncan also be spun into cord.\nNutritional Facts\nChayote is a good source of vitamin C.\n228\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n41\nWater (%) \n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n7\nFat (grams)\n1\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n8\nProtein (grams)\n3\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n180\nIron\n2\nZinc\n1\nManganese\n1\nPotassium\n756\nMagnesium\n54\nPhosphorus\n85\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n720 RE\nVitamin C\n43\nThiamin\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0.2\nNiacin\n1\nVitamin B6\n0.2\nFolate\n197 μg\nVitamin E\n4\nChicory\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1 cup greens, raw (180 g)\nVarieties\nThe two basic types of chicory, forcing\nand nonforcing, are distinguished by their\nmethod of cultivation. The forcing\nchicories are initially sown outdoors, but\nbecause exposure to light tends to create\na bitter taste, the plants are transferred to\na dark area (a process called blanching)\nfor the latter half of their growth. As a\nresult, forcing chicories have a milder fla-\nvor. The most common forcing varieties\nare the Witloof chicory, sometimes called\nBelgian endive, and the red-leaf radic-\nchio, an Italian chicory that is becoming\nincreasingly popular in the United States.\nNonforcing chicories do not require\nblanching.  These varieties are grown like\nlettuce, without forcing.  The Italian\nradichetta, more common in North\nAmerica than in Europe, has narrow leaves\nthat grow on wide stalks and are cooked\nlike asparagus.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nChicory is native to Europe and western\nAsia.

Later, it was\nbrought to North America, where it now\ngrows wild and in cultivated form.\nChicory can be grown in a variety of\nsoil types.  Seeds generally are sown directly\ninto open ground.  Because most types\nof chicory thrive in cool temperatures,\nplanting is done in early spring or late\nfall.  Chicory plants have shallow roots,\nso frequent irrigation is necessary.  The\nplants grow with a scruffy appearance and\nwith multiple stick-like stems that are 2\nto 3 feet tall.  Bright, almost iridescent,\nblue flowers appear on the stems in the\nsecond year.\nForcing varieties are dug up in late fall,\nthe leaves and roots are cut back, and the\nplants are laid horizontally in pots of moist\npeat in a dark, warm place.  After 3 or 4\nweeks, the heads are ready to be cut.\nNonforcing varieties of chicory are plant-\ned in the spring and picked like lettuce in\nthe fall.  They can be used immediately\nor stored in a cool place for later use.\nLeading domestic producers of chicory,\nparticularly the newly popular radicchio,\nare California and New Jersey. Some\nchicory is also grown in Mexico and Italy.\nUses\nChicory, Belgian endive, and radicchio\nshould be selected and stored in a manner\nsimilar to arugula and lettuce.

However, one type, sweet corn, is prepared and\nserved as a fresh vegetable.  The seeds, or kernels, which are the edible part of \nthe plant, form in spikelets on a woody axis called an ear.  They are covered \nwith a green husk. Ears of corn vary in size, and the \nkernels range from white to yellow, orange, \nred, brown, blue, purple, and black, \nalthough sweet corn is always \nwhite or butter-yellow.\nVariety\nOf the many types of corn, sweet corn is\nthe only variety that is eaten fresh as a\nvegetable.  Sweet corn is available in\nseveral varieties divided by kernel color.\nSome sweet corn is pure yellow; some,\nlike Silver Queen, is white; and some, like\nButter and Sugar, is bicolored, that is, it\nhas both yellow and white kernels.\nPopping corn, baby corn, and the white\ncorn known as hominy are different types\nof eating corn.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nCorn is native to the Americas, probably\nhaving originated in Mexico or\nGuatemala, where historians believe it\nevolved from a wild grain called teosinte\nthat still grows in the Mexican highlands.\nThe corn plant, which can attain heights\nof 20 feet, has a hard, jointed stalk.  Male\nflowers develop in the tassel at the top of\nthe stalk, and the female flower is a cluster\nat the joint of the stalk.  Corn is polli-\nnated by the wind.  The corn silk hang-\ning from the husk of each ear is the pollen\nreceptor; each thread must receive a grain\nof pollen for the kernels to develop.  Corn\ngrows best during long, hot summers.  It\nrequires rich soil and regular fertilizing,\nparticularly with nitrogen.  Because the\nflowers are wind-pollinated, plants should\nbe spaced closely together.  The ears do\nnot ripen well in cold weather, so the\nseeds must be planted in plenty of time\nfor the kernels to develop before the first\nautumn frost.  Although each ear of corn\nproduces many kernels, the plant has no\nnatural mechanism for dispersing its\nseeds.  To ensure that it will be tender and\nsucculent for eating, sweet corn is picked\nbefore it reaches maturity.\nUses\nSweet corn is a popular vegetable in the\nUnited States.  The average American eats\nabout 25 pounds of corn every year, most\nof it frozen or canned, but in summer,\ncorn is preferred fresh on the cob.\nBecause the sugars in the kernels of sweet\ncorn begin to convert to starch as soon\nas the ear is picked, corn should be eaten\nas soon after harvest as possible.\nWhile still on the cob and after the\nhusks are removed, corn can be boiled,\nsteamed, or microwaved, but the secret\nto retaining the flavor is to cook it no\nmore than a few minutes.  For grilling\nears of corn in their husks, the ears should\nbe soaked in water for about 20 minutes\nand then cooked on a grill rack or in the\noven for 10 to 15 minutes.  Grilling or\nroasting husked corn (for 5 to 7 minutes)\nproduces a stronger flavor.\nNutrient composition\nCorn provides some fiber, vitamin C, and\nfolate.\nCorn\nFamily Gramineae (Poaceae)\nScientific name Zea mays L.\nCommon names corn, sweet corn\n♥Moderately good source of fiber,\nvitamin C, and folate\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup (about \n1 ear) yellow \n1 cup \ncorn, boiled \npopcorn, air-\n(82 g)\npopped (8 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n89\n31\nWater (%) \n70\n4\nDietary fiber (grams)\n2\n1\nFat (grams)\n1\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n21\n6\nProtein (grams)\n3\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n2\n1\nIron\n1\n0\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n204\n24\nMagnesium\n26\n10\nPhosphorus\n84\n24\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n18 RE\n2 RE\nVitamin C\n5\n0\nThiamin\n0.2\n0\nRiboflavin\n0.1\n0\nNiacin\n1\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\n0\nFolate\n38 μg\n2 μg\nVitamin E\n0\n0\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n4\nWater (%) \n89\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n0\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n41\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n112\nMagnesium\n7\nPhosphorus\n20\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n159 RE\nVitamin C\n15\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n40 μg\nVitamin E\n0\n232\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nVarieties\nThe most common variety of cress is\nwatercress, which grows in flooded soil\nbeds and has small, heart-shaped leaves\nand a slightly bitter taste.  Watercress is\ndifficult to grow in home gardens.  An\neasily grown, hardy alternative is winter\ncress, with dark-green, strongly flavored\nleaves that form rosettes.  Other varieties\ninclude broad-leaved cress, with oval\nleaves; peppergrass, or curly cress, with\nan attractive, ornamental appearance;\nextra curled, a compact plant with short\nstalks and fine leaves; and garden cress, a\ntall, cool-season annual.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nCress grows wild in many parts of the\nworld, including Asia, the Middle East,\nEurope, North America, and New\nZealand.  Watercress is native to Europe,\nand garden cress originated in Persia, later\nspreading to India, Syria, Greece, and\nEgypt.  Watercress has been cultivated\nsince ancient Roman times.  Commercial\ncultivation was first recorded in Germany\nin 1750 and later in Great Britain in\n1808.  Today, watercress is grown in Great\nBritain and in the United States, mainly\nin California, Florida, and Virginia.\nWinter cress is cultivated as a substitute\nfor watercress when flowing water is not\navailable for planting.  It is produced\nmostly in the United States, favored by\ngrowers because of its hardiness.\nCress is propagated from seeds or stem\ncuttings and generally prefers the cool\ngrowing conditions of early spring and\nlate fall.  The growth of watercress\nrequires a special environment with\nflooded soil beds containing absolutely\npure water, because any water-borne con-\ntaminants could be deposited on the\nplant.  The leafy stems are generally\nharvested about 180 days after planting.\nRequirements for other varieties vary.\nGarden cress, which can grow up to 18\ninches tall, prefers sun or light shade and\nwell-drained soil.  Seeds can be sown at\nintervals from early spring through the\nsummer in order to furnish a constant\nsupply of young leaves.  The whole plants\nare harvested about 60 days after planting.\nHardy winter cress is not planted until\nJuly or August and can be harvested from\nlate fall through the winter, until the\nplants begin to flower in spring.  The\nleaves of most cresses are picked when they\nare 3 to 5 inches long, or the entire plant\ncan be harvested before seed stalks form.\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1 cup, raw (34 g)\nCress (watercress)\nUses\nThe raw, young leaves of the cress plant\nare sold in bunches. When selecting\nwatercress, choose crisp leaves with deep\ncolor, and avoid those with yellow leaves.\nWatercress can be refrigerated up to 5\ndays in a plastic bag or with the stem ends\nin a glass of water and the leaves covered\nwith a plastic bag.  The leaves and\ntrimmed stems may be added to salads,\nsandwiches, and soups and used as a\ngarnish for a variety of dishes.\nNutrient composition\nWatercress is high in vitamin A and\nvitamin C.  As a cruciferous vegetable, it\ncontains phytochemicals that may help\nprevent cancer.\nCress is a member of the mustard family, a cruciferous vegetable whose small,\ndark-green leaves add a slight crunch and a \ntangy, peppery flavor to dishes.\nFamily Cruciferae\nScientific name Lepidium sativum\n(garden cress)\nCommon name cress, garden cress, \nwatercress\n♥High in vitamin C\n♥A good source of folate and vitamin A\n♥A cruciferous vegetable that contains\nphytochemicals that may help prevent\ncancer\nVegetables\n233\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n7\nWater (%) \n96\nDietary fiber (grams)\n0\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n1\nProtein (grams)\n0\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n7\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n75\nMagnesium\n6\nPhosphorus\n10\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n21 RE\nVitamin C\n3\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n7 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \nThe cucumber is a member of the same family as gourds, melons, and squash.\nAlthough the cucumber is botanically a fruit, it is more commonly thought of and\nused as a vegetable.  It is usually oblong and 1 to 8 inches long.  It has glossy,\ndark-green skin and tapering ends.  Its interior is generally pale green to white,\nwith rows of tender, edible \nseeds down the center.  \nCucumbers are largely \nwater.  They are \nmoist but crisp, and \ntheir flavor is sweet \nand mild.\nVarieties\nCucumbers grow in a variety of shapes\nand sizes, from tiny gherkins to green-\nhouse types that are up to 20 inches long.\nAll have a similar flavor.  Those grown\nprimarily for eating fresh are called slic-\ning varieties and include both field-grown\nand greenhouse cucumbers.  The green-\nhouse varieties, sometimes called English\ncucumbers, tend to be longer and nar-\nrower, milder, and seedless.  One type of\nEnglish cucumber is sometimes referred\nto as “burpless.”  Other varieties are cul-\ntivated for pickling.  These are usually\nsmaller than slicing cucumbers and have\nbumpy, lighter-colored skins.  The\nsmallest is the gherkin, which is only 1 or\n2 inches long.  One of the pickling\nvarieties, the Kirby, is often sold fresh and\nis enjoyed for its thin skin, crispness, and\nvery small seeds.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe cucumber is believed to have origi-\nnated in wild form in the mountains of\nnorthern India, where a similar wild\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup, sliced (52 g)\nCucumber\nUses\nWhole cucumbers can be refrigerated in\na crisper up to 1 week, tightly wrapped\nin plastic.\nWith its high water content, the\ncucumber is especially refreshing in warm\nweather, chilled and eaten fresh, pickled\nand eaten alone, or added to green salads\nor sandwiches.  In the Mediterranean\nregion, cucumber often is grated into\nyogurt, to which spices and raisins or nuts\nare added to make a cooling condiment\nfor spicy dishes.\nNutrient composition\nCucumbers are composed mostly of water\nand contain only small amounts of nutrients.\nFamily Cucurbitaceae\nScientific name Cucumis sativus\nCommon name cucumber\nspecies still grows.  It was also in India\nthat the cucumber was first cultivated,\nabout 3,000 years ago.  From there it was\nbrought to Greece and then to Western\nEurope.  Columbus transported the\ncucumber to the Americas, where it even-\ntually was cultivated by American Indians\nand European colonists in eastern North\nAmerica and as far north as Canada.\nToday, the leading producers of cucum-\nbers in the United States are Florida,\nNorth Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and\nSouth Carolina.\nCucumbers require warm tempera-\ntures and should not be planted until all\ndanger of frost has passed.  Distinct male\nand female flowers develop on one\ncucumber plant, and pollen is carried by\ninsects; 10 to 20 bee visits per flower per\nday are required to produce long, straight\nfruit.  In contrast, greenhouse cucumbers\nare not pollinated, so they form without\nseeds.  Both field and greenhouse types\nare  picked as soon as they are of edible\nsize so that the plants will continue to\nproduce flowers and fruit.\nshould be left intact until just before\ncooking.

Eggplants range \nin length from 2 to 12 inches.\nVarieties\nThe eggplant is available in many varieties.\nIn the United States, the most common\neggplant is the large, cylindrical or pear-\nshaped variety with a smooth, glossy, dark-\npurple skin.  Another popular variety is\nthe Japanese or Asian eggplant, which\nranges from solid purple to striated shades\nand has tender, slightly sweet flesh.  The\nItalian, or baby, eggplant looks like a minia-\nture version of the larger common variety.\nThe egg-shaped White Egg has tougher\nskin and firmer, smoother flesh.\nOrigin & Botanical Facts\nFirst cultivated more than 4,000 years\nago, the eggplant is believed to be native\nto India, from where it was subsequent-\nly brought to China. In the Middle Ages,\nArab traders brought it to Spain and\nnorthern Africa. By the 18th century,\nboth the French and the Italians culti-\nvated eggplant, which they called\naubergine.  Thomas Jefferson introduced\nthe eggplant to the United States.\nHowever, it was not until the 20th century\nthat Americans began to use the eggplant\nas a food.  Previously, it was used as a table\ndecoration.  Today, the eggplant is most\npopular in the cuisines of southern Italy\nand the Middle East.\nThe eggplant is a frost-intolerant\nperennial grown as an annual.  It will sus-\ntain damage if the temperature falls below\n65° Fahrenheit.  Eggplant is available\nthroughout the year.  The peak season is\nfrom July to October.

The\nseeds have a pungent, aromatic scent.\nVariety\nThe two basic types of fennel, common\nfennel and Florence fennel, bear a close\nresemblance to one another but are used\ndifferently.  The shoots, leaves, and seeds\n(called “fruit”) of the common fennel are\nused primarily as flavoring agents for\nfood. Several varieties of common fennel\nhave seeds that differ in length, width,\nand taste.  These include the sweet variety,\nalso known as French or Roman fennel,\ncharacterized by long, yellowish green\nfruit with a sweet flavor; Indian fennel,\nwhich is brownish, smaller, and less\nrounded; and the pale-green Persian and\nJapanese varieties, which are the smallest\nand have a stronger anise flavor and odor.\nFlorence fennel, also called finocchio,\nis somewhat smaller than common fennel\nand is grown mainly for its broad, bulbous\nleaf base, which is eaten as a vegetable.  \nOrigin & botanical facts\nFennel is native to the Mediterranean\nregion and was well known to the ancient\nGreeks and Romans.  The Romans\nenjoyed the young shoots as both a\nflavoring and, according to their belief,\nan aid to controlling obesity.  The Greeks\ncalled it “marathon,” a name derived from\n“maraino,” meaning “to grow thin.”\nFrom the Mediterranean, fennel was\ncarried east to India and also north to\nEurope and England, especially to Roman\ncolonies.  Spanish settlers are believed to\nhave brought fennel to the Western\nHemisphere more than 200 years ago.  In\n1824, the American consul at Liverpool\ngave Thomas Jefferson fennel seeds for\nhis garden at Monticello. \nFennel is a long-lived plant that\nthrives almost anywhere.  Fennel plants\nusually grow to 3 or 4 feet but have been\nknown to reach 7 feet.  Young plants form\na bulbous, thick root the first year and\nflower the following summer.  By mid-\nsummer, the clusters of small yellow\nblossoms begin to droop with the weight\nof the heavy seeds.

Spring ginger, as young\nginger is sometimes called, has a pale, thin\nskin that does not require peeling.  Young\nginger is delicate and milder than mature\nginger.\nOrigin & Botanical Facts\nGinger is believed to be native to South\nChina or India, where it has been culti-\nvated since  ancient times.  The earliest\nrecorded mention of ginger appears in\nChinese writings.  According to the Pen\nTsao Ching (Classics of Herbs), written by\nShen Nung around 3000 B.C., ginger\n“eliminates body odor and puts a person\nin touch with the spiritual realm.”  In\nancient India, ginger was believed to\ncleanse the body spiritually.  Ginger also\nwas used to preserve food and treat diges-\ntive problems.  As in India, the ancient\nGreeks used ginger for digestive problems\nby eating ginger wrapped in bread after\nlarge meals.  Eventually, ginger was added\nto the bread dough, and the product became\nknown as gingerbread.  The Romans also\nused ginger as a digestive aid.  Arab traders\nintroduced ginger to the Mediterranean\narea, and in the 16th century, Francisco de\nMendoza of Spain brought it to the West\nIndies.  In England and Colonial America,\nginger was made into ginger beer, a popu-\nlar home remedy for diarrhea, nausea,\nand vomiting and a precursor to today’s\nginger ale.\nGinger thrives in the tropics and in\nwarmer regions of the temperate zone.\nCurrently, the herb is grown in several\nregions of West Africa and the West\nIndies, and in India and China.  The plant\nreaches maturity in the late summer when\nthe foliage begins to turn yellow.\nHowever, the root can be harvested at any\nstage simply by digging it up.  The finest\nquality ginger comes from Jamaica, where\nproduction is most abundant.  In the\nUnited States, ginger is grown in Florida,\nHawaii, and along the east coast of Texas.\nUses\nGinger is a popular ingredient in Asian\ncooking, for which it has been used for\ncenturies in both its fresh and dried\nforms.

Only the long, fleshy roots of this vegetable are used,\nbecause the leaves contain a slightly poisonous compound and have no culinary\nvalue.  Rough and cream-colored, the parsnip-like root can grow to 20 inches \nin length and 1 to 3 inches in diameter.  A sulfur-containing \ncompound known as allyl isothiocyanate is responsible for the \nroot’s strong, pungent odor and hot, biting flavor, which \nis reminiscent of mustard and results from a \nchemical reaction that occurs only when \nthe root is bruised or cut.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe horseradish is native to Eastern\nEurope and has been used as an herb since\nancient times.  It was grown in Greece\nmore than 3,000 years ago.  Mentioned\nin the Bible, it is one of the bitter herbs\nserved during the Jewish Passover festival.\nIn medieval Europe, the root was believed\nto be a cure-all.  Initially used only for its\nmedicinal properties, by the 1600s horse-\nradish had become a common condiment\nfor fish and meat in Europe.  The word\n“horse” in horseradish, often used to\nimply coarseness, as in horse-mint or horse\nchestnut, is used similarly in this case to\ndistinguish the plant from the edible\nradish (Raphanus sativus).\nThe perennial horseradish plant grows\nworldwide and is often found growing\nwild along roadsides throughout Europe\nand North America.

The\nmature tubers or roots, most of which are 3 to 4 inches long and about half as\nthick, resemble small, lumpy Irish potatoes. The white flesh of the Jerusalem \nartichoke is usually described \nas nutty, sweet, \nand crunchy.\nVarieties\nJerusalem artichokes exist in both red-\nand white-skinned varieties.  Smooth\nGarnet and Brazilian Red are red-skinned\nvarieties.  White-skinned varieties such\nas the New White Mammoth and\nBrazilian White have a clean, white skin\nand are also more rounded than the red-\ntinted ones.  Other varieties include the\nGolden Nugget, which has carrot-like\ntubers; Stampede, a quick-maturing\nvariety with large tubers; and Dwarf\nSunray, which is a small variety.  Modern\nvarieties  produce less knobby tubers that\nare easier to peel.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nOne of the few vegetables that is native\nto the North American plains, the\nJerusalem artichoke is indigenous to the\nlake regions of Canada.  In the United\nStates, it  grows as far south as Arkansas\nand Georgia.  Reportedly cultivated by\nAmerican Indians before the 16th century,\nthe tuber prefers to grow in damp places\nwith good soil.  It is a hardy perennial\nthat tolerates frost and can be left in the\nground all year.  The plants have stiff\nstems that may grow to a height of 10\nfeet, and some varieties produce small\nsunflowers late in the summer.  Several\ntubers are produced at the base of each\nflower stalk.\nUses\nJerusalem artichokes may be stored in a\nsealed plastic bag in the refrigerator for\nup to a week.  After that, they lose mois-\nture and become withered.  Jerusalem\nartichokes can be eaten raw in salads or\nserved with a dip.  Although they should\nbe washed thoroughly, they need not be\npeeled.

The former, which produces a\ntranslucent juice, is usually preferred, while\njicama de leche, which has elongated roots\nand a milky juice, is less familiar.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nA legume native to Central America and\nMexico, jicama is a perennial vine that\ngrows to a length of 20 feet or more and\nhas compound leaves with pointed edges.\nThe vine bears beautiful sprays of mauve,\nwhite, or blue flowers and poisonous seeds\nin pods 6 to 8 inches long.  Because the\ntuber requires a very long and warm\ngrowing season, most of the jicama avail-\nable in U.S. supermarkets is imported\nfrom Mexico and South America,\nalthough the plant is also grown in parts\nof east and southeast Asia.\nUses\nJicama is ready to be eaten at any stage\nof growth.

Like other seaweed, it is a large form of\nalgae.   Fresh seaweed and other sea vegetables are similar in texture to some \ndry-land greens, but they have a strong, salty, seawater flavor.\nVarieties\nThe thousands of varieties of algae grow\nin a broad spectrum of colors, shapes, and\nsizes, ranging from the small freshwater\nalgae to the long-stemmed kelp that flour-\nishes in the oceans.  Also called seaweed,\nagar-agar, carrageenan, and dulse, algae\nare generally classified by their color,\nwhich varies from brown to red, green,\nor blue-green.  Kelp is one of the brown\nalgae.  Some of the varieties of kelp\navailable in Japan include Wakame,\nArame, Kombu, and Hijiki.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe word “seaweed” generally refers to\nthe large red or brown varieties of algae.\nBrown algae grow in cold waters, and red\nalgae thrive in tropical seas.  Algae com-\npose two-thirds of the plant material on\nearth and are among the very few plants\nthat have not changed for centuries.  In\nancient times, sailors harvested the kelp\nbeds that thrived off the coasts of England\nand France and burned the plants for fuel.\nThey also wrapped fish in the fronds and\nbaked them.  Unlike the Japanese,\nEuropeans have never made significant use\nof kelp as a food.  However, 18th-century\nEuropean physicians noted that enlarged\nthyroid gland (goiter) rarely developed\nin people who lived along the coast.  In\n18th-century England, a physician success-\nfully used charred kelp to treat a patient\nwho had goiter.  It was not until the 19th\ncentury, however, that scientists discovered\nthat goiter is caused by iodine deficiency\nand that kelp is rich in iodine.  For several\ndecades after this discovery, Europeans\nand Americans harvested kelp from under-\nsea rocks to use as a source of iodine.\nUses\nToday, seaweed is a staple in the diets of\nsome people.  In Japan, seaweed consti-\ntutes approximately 25 percent of the\ndiet.  Kombu and Wakame, two popular\ntypes of kelp, are used extensively.\nKombu is used to make a tasty broth, and\nWakame is used as an ingredient in soups\nand stir-fries.  Sheets of Wakame are used\nto prepare sushi.  Powdered kelp can serve\nas a salt substitute, helping to flavor soups,\nsalads, and tomato juice.  In the United\nStates, dried sheets of seaweed can be\nfound in Asian groceries and in some\nsupermarkets.\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/8 cup, raw (10 g)\nKelp\nNutrient composition\nThe nutritional value of seaweed depends\non the type, but most provide calcium,\niodine, folate, and magnesium.  Dried\nkelp contains so much iodine that con-\nsumption of large quantities can be harm-\nful.  Some varieties, such as Kombu and\nWakame, are also high in sodium.\nFamily Laminariaceae\nScientific name Laminaria\nCommon name kelp\n242\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nThe kohlrabi is a member of the \ncabbage family, grown for the \nswollen, globe-shaped portion of the \nstem, which rests on the surface \nof the ground.  The best kohlrabi \nbulbs are between 2 and 3 inches in \ndiameter.  The vegetable can be white, \npurple, or green and has a creamy-white \ninterior that is somewhat sweet and similar \nin texture to a turnip.\nVarieties\nKohlrabi varieties are distinguished by\ncolor.  Among the popular varieties are the\nGrand Duke, Kolibri F1, Purple Danube,\nPurple Vienna, and White Vienna.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe kohlrabi, which literally means\n“cabbage turnip,” is descended from both\nthe wild cabbage and the wild turnip.\nAlthough the origin of this vegetable is\nuncertain, a vegetable answering to the\nsame description was mentioned by the\nRoman botanist Pliny in the 1st century\nA.D. No such vegetable was again\ndescribed until after the Middle Ages.\nToday, the kohlrabi is mainly eaten in\ncentral and eastern Europe.\nUnlike other cruciferous vegetables,\nthe part of kohlrabi that is eaten is a swollen\npart of the stem.  Kohlrabi has so declined\nin popularity in the last century that it\ncan be difficult to purchase.  The reason\nfor this decline is not known but may be\nits increased toughness with larger sizes.\nKohlrabi leaves are similar to collard greens\nor kale in flavor.  The succulent, tender\nleaves of young kohlrabi plants can be\ncooked like spinach or mustard greens.\nNutrient composition\nKohlrabi is high in vitamin C.  Raw\nkohlrabi is a good source of fiber.

Kohlrabi cultivation in the\nUnited States is quite limited.\nUses\nKohlrabi bulbs that are plum-size or\nsmaller, firm, and unblemished and have\nleaves that are still attached are best.  After\nthe leaf stems are removed, the bulbs of\nkohlrabi can be stored in the refrigerator\nfor several weeks (longer if placed in sealed\nplastic bags).  The kohlrabi bulb may be\neaten raw or cooked.  Although small,\ntender bulbs generally do not require peel-\ning, the skin of medium and large ones\nshould be removed before use.  The crisp\nflesh can be served raw in salads or made\ninto a relish.  The bulb also can be cubed,\nsliced, or julienned and steamed until\ntender.  The practice in many central\nEuropean countries is to hollow out the\nvegetable and stuff it with meat or other\nvegetables before baking or steaming.\nVegetables\n243\nThe leek is related to garlic, scallions, and onions and resembles a large scallion.\nUnlike the onion, however, it does not form a real bulb but grows \nas a thick, fleshy stalk with flattened leaves.  The leaves \nare green to blue-green or purple and wrap tightly \naround each other like rolled paper.  The white \nleaf base—the part that is most commonly \neaten—has a flavor and fragrance \nsimilar to but milder than onions.\nVarieties\nThe many varieties of leeks differ mostly\nin the color of their leaves, their general\ncold hardiness, and the degree of bulbing\nat the stem base.  Those with blue or\npurple leaves tend to be the hardiest.  An\nold French variety called Bleu Solaise,\nwhich is known to be resistant to cold,\nhas blue-green leaves. \nOrigin & botanical facts\nLeeks are native to southern Europe and\nthe Mediterranean region, where  they\nstill grow wild.  Both wild and cultivated\nleeks have been consumed for thousands\nof years.  In ancient Rome,  Emperor\nNero consumed large quantities of leeks\nin the belief that they would improve his\nsinging voice.  In the 6th century, Wales\nadopted the leek as its national symbol\nin the belief that leeks worn on the\nhelmets of Welsh soldiers, to distinguish\nthem from enemy troops, helped them\nachieve victory.  Today, France, Belgium,\nand the Netherlands lead the world in\nleek production.  Although not as popular\nin the United States, the leek is cultivated\nin California, Michigan, New Jersey, and\nVirginia.  Leeks can be grown from seed\nor transplants, but transplanting is the\npreferred method, for which plants are\nbegun in containers between December\nand April.  Leeks prefer a cool to moderate\nclimate, rich but well-drained soil, and\nuniform watering.  The base is blanched\nby tilling the soil up around each plant\nwhen it is about the size of a pencil.\nBlanching makes the edible portion\nlonger and whiter.  Leek plants produce\nflowering stems more than 6 feet in\nheight, with white, pink, or dark-red\nflowers.  On most leek varieties, numer-\nous bulbils, or secondary bulbs, form\naround the base of the plant, and these\ncan be used to start new plants.\nUses\nBefore being used, leeks should be washed\nthoroughly to remove any soil or grit\ntrapped between the leaves, and the\nrootlets and leaf ends should be trimmed\noff.  Like onions and garlic, leeks are used\nprimarily to add flavor to a variety of\nLeek\ndishes.  Raw leeks can be sliced thin and\nadded to salads of all types. Sliced or\npuréed, they add zest to quiches, stews,\ncasseroles, mixed vegetable dishes, and\nsoups.  They are one of the key ingredi-\nents in French vichyssoise, a classic cold\npotato and leek soup.  They also may be\nbaked, braised in broth or wine, broiled,\nsautéed, or microwaved.

The leaves are pale to dark green or\ngreen with red edges, crisp, and \nmild to pungent.\nVarieties\nFour basic types of lettuce are grown: head\nlettuce, loose leaf, butterhead, and\nromaine.  The most common, popular\nvariety is iceberg, a compact head lettuce\nthat is pale green and has a delicate flavor.\nLoose leaf lettuce forms rosettes of crisp,\ncurly leaves 8 to 12 inches long and\nincludes the red-edged varieties.  The mild\nbutterhead lettuce, including the Boston\nand Bibb varieties, has a softly compressed\nhead, 8 to 12 inches across, of grass-green\nleaves that fade to a lighter yellowish green\nin the interior.  Romaine lettuce forms a\ndark-green, tightly compressed head of\nleaves about 10 inches long and has a\nstronger, more pungent flavor than the\nother varieties.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe cultivation of lettuce dates back more\nthan 2,500 years. From early Rome,\nwhere many varieties were developed, its\npopularity spread throughout Europe and\nAsia. In 1885, an American agricultural\nreport listed 87 varieties, considerably\nmore than the 4 commonly available in\ntoday’s markets. In the United States,\nlettuce ranks a close second to potatoes\nas the most popular fresh vegetable.  The\nfour leading American producers are\nCalifornia, Arizona, Florida, and Colorado.\nLettuce is cultivated by direct seed-\ning into fields or by seedling transplan-\ntation into raised beds.  Loose leaf lettuce\nmatures about 6 weeks after seeds are\nsown; other types take longer to mature.\nRomaine takes the longest (up to 12 weeks).\nHead lettuce is harvested when the heads\nreach about 2 pounds.  Because lettuce\nis very perishable, harvesting is done by\nhand, and the crop is packed directly into\nboxes in the field. Head lettuce, which is\nthe hardiest, can be shipped long distances\nwithout damage, but leaf lettuce is more\nfragile and usually is grown for local and\nregional markets.\nUses\nLettuce should be used as soon after pur-\nchase as possible, but if it must be stored,\nleaves that are wilting should be removed.\nUnwashed lettuce can be kept 3 to 4 days\nat most in a perforated plastic bag in the\nvegetable crisper of the refrigerator.\nLettuce is most often eaten raw in salads\nand sandwiches.  Iceberg, leaf, or romaine\nLettuce\nworks well in Greek salad; romaine is often\nused for Caesar salad. Combinations of\nlettuce varieties make for tastier and more\nnutritious salads. A salad spinner improves\nthe quality of salads by drying the greens\nquickly and completely.  In addition to\nbeing used in salads, lettuce leaves can be\nused to hold cooked vegetables, sandwich\nfillings, and condiments.\nNutrient composition\nRomaine and loose leaf lettuce contain\nfive to six times the vitamin C and five\nto ten times the vitamin A of iceberg.\nRomaine and butterhead lettuce are good\nsources of folate.\nNutrient Content\nRomaine\nLoose leaf\n(56 g)\n(56 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n8\n10\nWater (%) \n95\n94\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n1\n2\nProtein (grams)\n1\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n20\n38\nIron\n1\n1\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n162\n148\nMagnesium\n3\n6\nPhosphorus\n25\n14\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n146 RE\n106 RE\nVitamin C\n13\n10\nThiamin\n0.1\n0\nRiboflavin\n0.1\n0\nNiacin\n0\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\n0\nFolate\n76 μg\n28 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \n0 \nSERVING\nSIZE: 1 cup, shredded \nVegetables\n245\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup \n7 medium,\npieces,\ncooked\nraw (35 g)\n(84 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n9\n22\nWater (%) \n92\n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n0\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n1\n4\nProtein (grams)\n1\n2\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n2\n5\nIron\n0\n1\nZinc\n0\n1\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n130\n299\nMagnesium\n4\n10\nPhosphorus\n36\n73\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n1\n3\nThiamin\n0\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0.1\n0.3\nNiacin\n1\n4\nVitamin B6\n0\n0.1\nFolate\n4 μg\n15 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \n0\nMushrooms are fleshy fungi, only some of which are edible.

When cooked,\nthe pods exude a juice that thickens any liquid to which it is added and can give\nthe vegetable a slimy texture.\nVarieties\nThe many varieties of okra differ in shade\nof green, shape (plump or slender), and\nsurface (ribbed or smooth).  The Clemson\nSpineless variety has medium-green,\nangular pods, whereas the Emerald variety\nis dark green and has smooth, round\npods.  Other varieties include Lee, Annie\nOakley, and Prelude.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe okra plant originated in the Near\nEast and was brought to North Africa\nand the Middle East before being brought\nto the Americas in the early 1700s.  The\nname “okra” is derived from the Twi\n(from the Gold Coast of Africa) word\n“nkruman.”  In other parts of the world,\nthis vegetable is referred to by the African\nname “gumbo” and by other regional\nnames.  Whether West African slaves or\nFrench colonists of Louisiana brought the\nplant to the United States is unclear, but\nits widespread popularity in the South\nsuggests that this region was the first in\nthe United States to be introduced to\nthe vegetable.  Texas, Georgia, Florida,\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup, sliced (80 g)\nOkra\nunless okra is added to soup or stew, it\nshould never be cut before cooking,\nbecause cutting releases the fluid that acts\nas a thickener and gives okra the slimy\ntexture with which it is associated.  The\nsecret to tender but crisp okra is to sauté\nthe whole pods for no more than 5 min-\nutes.  In the United States, okra is most\npopularly known as an ingredient in\ngumbo, a stew-like dish that is a specialty\nof New Orleans Creole cuisine.  Okra is\nalso available in frozen and canned forms.\nNutrient composition\nOkra is high in vitamin C and is a good\nsource of magnesium.\nAlabama, and California are the leading\nproducers in the United States.\nThe okra plant is a tropical perennial\nbelonging to the cotton family.  The\nplants begin to produce flowers about 60\ndays after germination and can grow 3 to\n5 feet in height.  The maroon-centered,\npale-yellow flowers develop into slender\nseedpods that are harvested a few days\nafter the flower petals have fallen.  Okra,\nthe vegetable, should not be confused\nwith Chinese okra, which is also known\nas dishcloth gourd, sponge gourd, or\nloofah.\nUses\nBecause very young or fully developed\nokra pods tend to be flavorless and stringy,\npods that are 1 to 3 inches should be\nselected.  Fresh okra is very perishable\nand should be used as soon as possible.\nIt can be stored in a plastic bag in the\nrefrigerator for a couple of days.  Fresh\nokra should be washed and thoroughly\ndried before cooking, because moisture\ncauses the pods to become slimy.

Its flavor can range from mild \nand sweet to sharp and pungent.\nVarieties\nThe two main varieties of onion are fresh\nonions and dry onions.  Scallions (also\ncalled green onions), the most common\ntype of fresh onion, are pulled up before\nthe bulb forms.  Sweet onions, another\ntype of fresh onion, grown in warmer\nclimates, are harvested and sold during\nthe spring and summer.  They are char-\nacterized by a light-colored, thin skin and\na high water and sugar content, which\ngives them a mild, sweet flavor.  The most\npopular sweet onions are the mild Maui\nfrom Hawaii, the juicy Vidalia from\nGeorgia, and the round, golden Walla-\nWalla from Washington State.\nDry onions, also called storage onions,\nare grown in cooler northern states and\nare available year-round.  They have a\ndarker, thicker skin, a firmer texture, and\na stronger, more pungent flavor.  They\nrange from white to yellow and red.\nSmaller varieties of dry onions include\nthe marble-sized pearl onions and the\nslightly larger boiling onions. Although\nred onions tend to be sweeter than yellow\nor white onions, the flavor of dry onions\nis influenced more by variety and origin\nthan by color.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nOnions were grown by the ancient\nEgyptians, who regarded them as sacred.\nFrom Egypt, onions were brought to\nRome, where they acquired their current\nname, derived from the Latin unio, mean-\ning “large pearl.”  Christopher Columbus\nbrought the onion from Europe to the\nAmericas.  Today, onions are among the\nworld’s leading vegetable crops.\nOnion plants are propagated from\nseeds or from seedlings and are planted\non raised beds, in fertile, well-balanced\nsoil.  They are hardy plants, able to\nwithstand temperatures as low as 20°\nFahrenheit, and are generally planted in\nearly spring, 4 to 6 weeks before the last\nspring freeze.  When first planted, young\nonions concentrate their growth on new\nroots and green leaves or tops.  Bulb for-\nmation does not begin until the right\ncombination of daylight, darkness, and\ntemperature is achieved.\nUses\nFresh onions should be refrigerated and\nused soon after purchase, but dry (storage)\nonions can be kept in a cool, dry place\nfor weeks, or even months, without losing\ntheir nutrients.  The onion’s flavor and\nodor result primarily from sulfuric com-\npounds.  When the onion is peeled and\nsliced, these are released as vapors, causing\nthe eyes to tear.  Chilling the onion before\nuse or peeling it under cold water can\nalleviate this problem.  Onions can be\nserved raw or cooked and can be added to\nnumerous other foods as a flavoring.\nCooking onions tends to soften them and\nremoves any sharpness from the flavor.\nHowever, because heat makes onions\nbitter, they should be cooked over low to\nmedium heat.  Onions can be boiled,\nsteamed, baked, sautéed, scalloped, or\ngrilled.\nNutrient Composition\nRaw onions contain phytochemicals that\ninclude antioxidants, which promote\nhealth.\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup raw,\nchopped, or 1\nmedium (80 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n30\nWater (%) \n90\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n7\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n16\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n126\nMagnesium\n8\nPhosphorus\n26\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n5\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\nFolate\n15 μg\nVitamin E\n0\nFamily Amaryllidaceae\nScientific name Allium cepa\nCommon name onion\n♥Contains phytochemicals that\npromote health\nOnion\n248\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n1\nWater (%) \n88\nDietary fiber (grams)\n0\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n0\nProtein (grams)\n0\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n5\nIron\n0\nZinc\n–\nManganese\n–\nPotassium\n21\nMagnesium\n2\nPhosphorus\n2\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n20 RE\nVitamin C\n5\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n6 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient\nvalue is not available.\nParsley is a bright-green, multibranched biennial herb with\ncrisp leaves and greenish yellow flowers.  It is most \noften used as a seasoning or garnish and has a \nfresh, slightly peppery flavor.\nVarieties\nAlthough more than 30 varieties of\nparsley exist, the most commonly used\nin the United States are the curly-leaved\nand the Italian, or flat-leaved, varieties.\nAmong the curled parsleys are Moss\nCurled, Green Velvet, and Paramount\nImperial.  The flat-leaved variety, most\ncommonly used in southeastern Europe\nand in Asia, has a more vibrant flavor\nthan the curled types.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nParsley is believed to have originated in\nsouthern Europe, around the Mediterranean,\nand has been cultivated since about 320\nB.C.  In ancient times, parsley wreaths\nwere believed to ward off drunkenness.\nAccording to Greek mythology, parsley\nsprang from the blood of Opheltes, the\ninfant son of King Lycurgus of Nemea,\nwho was killed by a serpent while his\nnurse directed some thirsty soldiers to\nwater.  Thus, Greek soldiers associated\nparsley with death and avoided contact\nwith it before battle.  A completely dif-\nferent meaning is imparted to the herb\nin the Jewish Seder, the ritual Passover\nmeal.  Because parsley is one of the first\nherbs to appear in the spring, it is used\nin the Seder to symbolize new beginnings.\nThe ancient Romans ate parsley after\nmeals to freshen their breath, and the\nRoman physician Galen prescribed it for\nepilepsy and as a diuretic.  In Europe dur-\ning the Middle Ages, parsley was regard-\ned as the devil’s herb and was believed to\nbring disaster on anyone who grew it\nunless it was planted on Good Friday.\nNevertheless, medieval abbess and\nherbalist Hildegard of Bingen and the\n17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper\nprescribed it in various forms for heart\nand chest pain and for arthritis.  During\nthe late 19th and early 20th centuries,\nparsley was prescribed for a variety of\nmedical conditions.  However, none of\nthese uses is recognized in modern med-\nicine.  Today, parsley is used primarily as\na flavoring agent and a garnish.\nParsley is a hardy plant that can be\ngrown easily in almost any soil.  It can be\nplanted in the spring for summer use and\nin late summer for winter growth and\nspring harvesting.  Soaking the seeds\novernight before planting helps germi-\nnation.  Flat-leaved parsley is cultivated\nmore easily than the curly-leaved types.  \nUses\nWhen selecting parsley, bunches that look\nfreshly picked, not wilted or yellow,\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1 Tblsp. chopped, \nraw (4 g)\nParsley\nshould be chosen.  Fresh parsley can be\nwrapped in damp paper towels and stored\nin an open plastic bag in the refrigerator\nfor up to 1 week.\nThe curly-leaved varieties of parsley\nare used as a flavoring, a salad ingredient,\nand a garnish.  Flat-leaved parsley, with\nits stronger flavor, is frequently used as a\nseasoning in Italian cooking.  Dried\nparsley may be substituted for the fresh\nherb by using one-third of the amount\nof the fresh herb specified by the recipe.\nNutrient composition\nA serving of parsley contains some\nvitamin C. \nFamily Apiaceae\nScientific name Petroselinum\ncrispum\nCommon name parsley\n♥Contains some vitamin C\nVegetables\n249\nVarieties\nUnlike their cousins the carrots, parsnips\nare not bred for variety of color or shape,\nand the number of varieties is small.\nModern varieties are bred to grow a fat,\nwedge-shaped root.  The most disease-\nresistant types are the Gladiator, a sweet,\nearly-maturing parsnip, the Avonresister,\nand the Andover, a new American variety.\nThe most popular parsnip is the All\nAmerican, which has broad “shoulders,”\nwhite flesh, and a tender core.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nWild parsnips were eaten by the ancient\nGreeks and Romans.  The word pastinaca,\npart of the modern scientific name for\nparsnips, was used by Pliny in the 1st\ncentury A.D., but it may have referred to\neither parsnips or carrots, or both.\nAccording to Pliny, the parsnip was so val-\nued by the Emperor Tiberius that he had\nit imported to Rome from the banks of\nthe Rhine.  Sixteenth-century Germans\nexploited the parsnip’s high sugar content\nto make wine, jam, and sweet flour for\ncakes.  During the season of Lent, parsnips\nwere eaten with salt fish.  Today, parsnips\nare cultivated throughout Europe,\nCanada, and the northern United States.\nNorthern California and Michigan are\nthe leading domestic growers.\nAlthough it is a biennial, the parsnip\nis usually grown as an annual, harvested\nbefore the second year’s leaves begin to\nappear.  Parsnips are propagated from\nseeds and planted in deep, loamy, fine\nsoil that has not been  fertilized recently.\nIn cold climates, parsnips are planted in\nearly spring, but in areas where temper-\natures rarely fall below 25 degrees, seeds\ncan be sown in early fall for a spring\nharvest.  The roots take from 100 to 120\ndays to mature from seeds.  The green\nstalks grow above ground, anywhere from\n9 inches to 2 feet in height, with smooth,\noblong leaflets about 4 or 5 inches long.\nThe flowers, when permitted to develop,\nare deep yellow.  Chilling the parsnip\nroots, either before or after harvesting,\nresults in a sweeter flavor.\nUses\nThe best parsnips are those that are small\nto medium in size, crisp, and plump.\nThey should be stored in a perforated plas-\ntic bag in the refrigerator crisper.

Each\ntype includes numerous varieties.  The\nmost common variety of sweet peppers\nis the round bell pepper, which is sold by\ncolor.  Although all bell peppers are green\nwhen immature, most turn red when\ncompletely ripe, and some turn yellow,\norange, purple, or brown.  Ripe, colored\nbell peppers are usually sweeter than their\nimmature, green counterparts.  Other\nvarieties of sweet pepper include banana\npeppers, a mild variety that is the shape\nand color of bananas; Cubanelle, a\ntapered, light-green or yellow variety that\nis more flavorful than bell peppers; and\npimientos, thick-fleshed, heart-shaped\npeppers that are ideal for roasting.\nHot peppers, also called chilis, vary\ngreatly in size, shape, and spiciness, and,\nlike sweet peppers, they are green when\nimmature.

Although all peppers \nare crunchy, their flavors range from sweet \nto extremely hot.\ngreen and can be mildly pungent to hot,\ndepending on growing conditions.  The\nsmall Habañero peppers, which may be red,\ngreen, or orange and either bell-shaped\nor teardrop-shaped, are extremely hot.\nJalapeños, the most widely available chilis,\nare stubby and pointed, varying from\ngreen to red and from mild to hot.  Dried\njalapeños are known as chipotles.\nPoblaños are long and pointed and have\na dark-green skin and a mild to medium\nheat.  Dried poblaños are called Anchos\nand are dark-purple to brown with a sweet\nflavor.  Serraños, either green or red, are\nsmall and tapered and very hot.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nPeppers are native to Asia and the Western\nHemisphere, where they have been a\nculinary staple for thousands of years, but\nthey were unknown in Europe until\nColumbus brought them home from his\nfirst voyage to the Americas.  In the\nUnited States, sweet peppers constitute\nmore than 60 percent of the pepper crop.\nThe leading domestic growers of peppers\nare California and Florida.  Many pep-\npers also are imported from Latin\nAmerica and Asia.\nBoth sweet and hot peppers are peren-\nnial shrubs that thrive in tropical areas\nbut have been adapted as annuals in cold-\ner regions.  Plants grow to about 2 feet\ntall and equally wide.  Proper flowering\nand fruit development require humidi-\nty.  Sweet bell peppers are usually har-\nvested when they are 3 to 4 inches in\ndiameter and are still green and crisp.\nThe size of hot peppers at harvest depends\non the variety.

The\nname comes from the Latin radix, meaning “root.”  Radishes can be round, oval,\nor elongated, and they range from less than 1 inch to 2 feet long.  Although skin\ncolor varies from white \nto yellow, red, purple, and \nblack, the interior flesh \nis usually white.\nVarieties\nRadishes are divided into spring- and\nwinter-harvested types, with additional\nvariations in shape and color in each\ncategory.  Spring radishes, which are\npulled before they reach 1 inch in diameter,\ninclude the round, red Cherry Belle; the\nWhite Icicle, which is oblong, about 6\ninches long, and mild in flavor; and\nRainbow Mix and Easter Egg varieties,\nwhich include purple-skinned roots.\nWinter radishes have a stronger, more\npungent flavor and a coarser texture.\nThey are larger than spring radishes,\nabout the weight of a turnip, and range\nfrom white to black.  White varieties\ninclude the Japanese daikon, a long, carrot-\nshaped, sharp-flavored radish.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nRadishes are an ancient vegetable, first cul-\ntivated thousands of years ago either in the\neastern Mediterranean region or in the Far\nEast and quickly spread throughout the\nworld.  The earliest radishes to be culti-\nvated were the black varieties.  Long, taper-\ning white radishes were first mentioned in\n16th-century European literature, and\nabout 200 years later, round radishes first\nappeared, along with the red-skinned types.\nIn the United States today, California and\nFlorida are the leading radish growers.\nFrom the top of the root, the leaves of\nthe radish plant form a rosette that can grow\nto 1 foot in height. The radish is a cool-\nweather annual, one of the easiest vegeta-\nbles to grow. Propagation is by direct seeding\ninto a  sandy soil with consistent moisture.\nSpring radishes can be planted as soon as\nthe ground is soft.  The fastest-growing\nvarieties mature in about 3 weeks.  Winter\nradishes are planted in late summer so they\ncan mature in the cool temperatures of\nautumn.  These larger radishes take at least\n55 days to reach a reasonable size.\nUses\nRadishes that are firm with bright, crisp\ngreens are the best.

The root has a crisp texture and a \nsweet, peppery flavor.\nVarieties\nThe differences among varieties of rutabaga\nare primarily in the color and shape of\nthe root.  Most types have yellow flesh.\nThe American Purple Top is purple above\nthe ground and light yellow below, with\nyellow flesh.  The Laurentian has a dark-\npurple top, a pale, smooth root, and yellow\nflesh.  The Magre has an attractive, round\nroot shape, and the Merrick is one of the\nrare white-fleshed rutabaga varieties.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe rutabaga originated from a chance\nhybridization between cabbage and turnip\nplants.  A relatively new vegetable com-\npared with those that have been around\nfor thousands of years, it probably\nemerged in medieval gardens where\nturnips and cabbage were grown side by\nside.  The first mention of rutabagas\noccurred in European botanical literature\nof the 17th century.  Rutabagas became\nvery popular in Scandinavia (the Swedish\nword rotabagge means “round root”), from\nwhere they were brought to England in\nthe late 18th century, acquiring the name\n“swede.”  Their cultivation in North\nAmerica began early in the 19th century.\nToday they are grown in the northern\nstates and Canada, because hot weather\ncan damage the crop.  Most domestic\nrutabagas are imported from Canada.\nRutabagas are biennials that thrive in\ncool temperatures and are best produced\nas a fall crop.  Because they require a long\ngrowing season, rutabagas should be\nplanted in the early spring in light but\nrich soil with good drainage.  Seeds are\nsown directly into fields, and the plants\nmust be irrigated regularly to produce a\nsweet, tender crop.  The roots are ready\nfor consumption about 3 months after\nsowing, when they are 4 to 5 inches in\ndiameter.  Harvesting should occur when\nthe ground is dry so that very little soil\nadheres to the roots.  Because they are\nresistant to fall frost and light winter\nfreezes, rutabagas can be mulched, left in\nthe ground, and harvested throughout\nthe fall and winter.  If they are pulled\nimmediately, they can be refrigerated or\nstored in cool, underground cellars.\nRutabagas are available year-round.\nUses\nRutabagas that are smooth-skinned, firm,\nand heavy for their size should be chosen.\nThey can be refrigerated in a plastic bag\nRutabaga\nup to 2 weeks.  Rutabagas should be\nwashed, trimmed, and peeled before\ncooking.  They can be cubed or sliced\nand boiled, steamed, or baked, then\nmashed or puréed and tossed with other\ningredients.  Rutabagas also make a tasty\naddition to soups and stews.  Their hearty\nflavor serves as a complement to other strong\nflavors, such as pork, duck, and spicy dishes.\nThe flavor of rutabagas is enhanced by\nherbs such as basil, dill, rosemary, savory,\nand thyme; spices such as ginger and\ncloves; and orange or lemon juice.\nNutrient composition\nRutabagas are high in vitamin C and are\na source of potassium.\nFamily Cruciferae\nScientific name Brassica napus L.\nCommon name rutabaga\n♥High in vitamin C and a source of\npotassium\nVegetables\n255\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n46\nWater (%) \n81\nDietary fiber (grams)\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n10\nProtein (grams)\n2\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n32\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n191\nMagnesium\n12\nPhosphorus\n38\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n3\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0.1\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\nFolate\n10 μg\nVitamin E\n0\nVarieties\nSalsify can be divided into three types:\nthe most familiar white salsify, black\nsalsify, and  Spanish salsify.  They are all\nsimilar in shape, flavor, flesh color, and size.\nHowever, black salsify, as its name implies,\nis black on the surface, and Spanish salsify\nis slightly wider in diameter than the other\nvarieties.  The most popular variety for\nthe home garden is the Mammoth\nSandwich Island, a subspecies of the white\nsalsify which has French blue flowers.\nThe Black Giant Russian is the most\ncommon of the Spanish salsify.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nIn its wild form, salsify is believed to have\nbeen a part of the diet of the ancient\nGreeks, although the vegetable was not\na popular culinary item until the mid-\n17th century.  Salsify appeared in North\nAmerica and in England during the 18th\ncentury.  The salsify plant is also known\nas “vegetable oyster” or “oyster plant”\nbecause its mild, sweet flavor is reminis-\ncent of that of the oyster, although some\nprefer to call it the “goatsbeard plant”\nbecause its grass-like leaves are bunched\nin a manner resembling a “goatee.”\nThe plant is a biennial, alternating\nyearly between purple and rose-colored\nflowers that resemble dandelions and are\nclosely related to lettuce and chicory.  The\nroots grow best in rich, slightly alkaline,\nfine-textured, loose sand and after expo-\nsure to the cold.  It is an easy vegetable\nto grow and is available year-round,\nalthough the peak season in the United\nStates is from June through February.\nSalsify is a more popular vegetable in\nEurope, which may explain its greater\navailability in markets specializing in\nGreek and Italian foods.  During harvest,\ncare must be taken not to damage the\nbrittle roots because bruised salsify loses\nmuch of its flavor.  After harvest, the roots\nmust be kept in cold storage at 90 to 98\npercent humidity to retain their fresh-\nness, because dehydrated roots shrivel and\nalso lose their flavor.\nUses\nA firm, well-formed, medium-size root\nthat is heavy for its size is the best choice.\nOversized roots are tough and woody and\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup sliced, \ncooked (68 g)\nSalsify\nshould be avoided.  Salsify oxidizes very\nquickly when peeled and must be placed\nin cold lemon water to prevent darkening.\nIf salsify is stored with the tops removed\nin a sealed plastic bag in a cold, moist\nstorage area, it may keep up to 4 months.\nSalsify can be baked, steamed, fried,\nserved in soups, or cut into cubes and\nstewed.  If roots are to be steamed, they\nshould be scrubbed and peeled before\ncooking.  The sliced root can be added\nto savory vegetable pies.  In addition,\nyoung shoots and flower buds can be used\nas a substitute for asparagus or added raw\nto salads.\nNutrient composition\nSalsify is not a significant source of nutrients.\nSalsify is a white-fleshed vegetable root that could easily be mistaken for a yellow-\nish gray carrot or parsnip.  The salsify plant, which is 10 to 12 inches in length\nand has a diameter of about 2 1/2 inches, is cultivated primarily for its slender\nedible roots, although\nthe young tender leaves, \noften called “chards,” \nare commonly used \nin salads.\nFamily Asteraceae\nScientific name Tragopogon\nporrifolius\nCommon name salsify, vegetable\noyster, oyster plant\n256\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n16\nWater (%) \n90\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n4\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n36\nIron\n1\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n138\nMagnesium\n10\nPhosphorus\n19\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n20 RE\nVitamin C\n9\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n0\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n32 μg\nVitamin E\n0\nVarieties\nScallion varieties may be classified by day\nlength (the number of hours of daylight\nthat optimizes their growth), market use,\nand bulb color.  Sweet Spanish is an\nexample of a long-day variety (one that\ndevelops best in areas with more hours of\ndaylight and in midsummer).  Southport\nWhite Globe onions are grown as scallions\nin areas with short days, where the short-\ner day length prevents bulb formation.\nCrossing onions with a variety called the\nJapanese bunching onion (Allium fistu-\nlosum), an onion that resembles a scallion\nbut is more bitter, results in hybrids that\ncan be grown as scallions in the summer\nand in areas with long days.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nScallions are propagated from seeds\nplanted in raised beds of fertile, well-pre-\npared, well-balanced soil with good mois-\nture retention.  They are hardy plants,\ncapable of withstanding temperatures as\nlow as 20° Fahrenheit.  However, minimal\ntemperatures of 55° are necessary for the\nplants to emerge from the soil, and optimal\ngrowth occurs when the temperature\nranges between 68° and 77° Fahrenheit.\nGrowth of scallions also depends on day\nlength.  Scallions are planted in fall,\nspring, and summer and are ready for\nharvest 2 to 4 months later.  Hand harvest\nis required, usually accomplished by\nundercutting the base of the plant.\nScallions are available year-round, but the\nsupply peaks from July through October.\nCalifornia is the leading domestic supplier\nof scallions.  Illinois, Ohio, and New\nJersey contribute a small proportion of the\ncrop.  During the winter and spring,\nscallions are imported from Mexico.\nUses\nScallions with slender bases tend to be\nmilder and sweeter.  Those with the crispiest\nleaves, shiny bright-green stalks, and no\nyellowing or tears are the best.  Scallions\nshould be stored in a plastic bag in the\nrefrigerator crisper.\nScallions can be consumed both raw\nand cooked.  Like mature onions, they\nare used primarily to enhance the flavor\nof other dishes.  Before use, they should\nbe rinsed well, and the roots and any wilted\nleaves should be removed.  The entire\nplant can be sliced or chopped and added\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup, chopped (50 g)\nScallion\nraw to salads and dips.

Today, many\nvarieties of snap beans are grown through-\nout the world.\nThe growth habit of snap beans is\nused to divide them into two varieties:\nbush beans and pole beans (which must\nbe trained to a pole or trellis).  Both are\nwarm-weather vegetables that must be\nplanted after the danger of frost has\npassed.  The beans are harvested when\nthey are rapidly growing, about 8 to 10\ndays after flowering.  At this stage, the\ncolor is bright and the pod is fleshy with\nsmall, green seeds.

Flat-leaf\nspinach has unwrinkled, spade-shaped\nleaves and a slightly milder taste than\nsavoy.  A third type that is increasing in\npopularity is the semi-savoy, whose slightly\ncurly leaves provide some of the texture of\nsavoy but are easier to clean.  All varieties\nhave the same appearance when cooked.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nSpinach probably originated in southwest\nAsia or the western Himalayas, but wild\nvarieties also grow in North Africa and\nIran.  The leafy vegetable was first culti-\nvated by the Persians.  Its cultivation\nreached China in the 7th century A.D. and\nEurope in the 9th century, when it was\nintroduced to Spain by the Arabs, who\nnamed it.  Today, spinach is grown and\nenjoyed in many parts of the world.  \nSpinach is an annual plant that\nrequires cool, damp weather and rich,\nmoist soil.  Spinach seed can be planted\nin early spring or in autumn, depending\non the variety.  Hardier types will survive\nthe winter in well-drained soils and can be\nharvested until spring.  More tender vari-\neties are planted in spring, as early as\nFebruary, for summer harvest.  Spinach\nis ready to be harvested about 6 weeks\nafter planting, when the largest leaves are\n6 to 8 inches long.\nUses\nSpinach leaves that are crisp and bright\nto dark green are best.  The leaves can be\nrefrigerated in a plastic bag for 3 days.\nSpinach can be served raw or cooked.\nThe flat-leaf variety, with its slightly\nmilder flavor, is generally preferred as a\nraw salad green.  Spinach should be\ncooked very quickly, either by steaming or\nby sautéing with a minimum of liquid,\njust until the leaves wilt.  The leaves also\ncan be added to soups, casseroles, and\nstews.  A variety of seasonings, such as\nlemon juice, soy sauce, horseradish,\ntomato sauce, or nutmeg, add flavor to\nspinach dishes.  Chopped, seasoned\nspinach also makes a flavorful stuffing for\nmushroom caps or a filling for savory\npastries.\nNutrient composition\nRaw spinach is high in vitamin A (beta-\ncarotene) and a good source of vitamin\nC and folate.  Cooked spinach is high in\nvitamin A (beta-carotene) and folate and\nis a good source of vitamin C, riboflavin,\nvitamin B6, calcium, iron, and magnesium.\nAlthough spinach is a good source of iron\nand calcium, oxalic acid (a chemical that\nis present in the leaves) inhibits the body’s\nabsorption of these nutrients.

Numerous varieties of squash are available in a\nwide assortment of colors, shapes, and sizes.  They can range from the patty pan\n(scallop) variety, which weighs only a couple of ounces, to the \npumpkin, which can attain weights of up to \n200 pounds.  The rind can be smooth, \nridged, or bumpy and can range from \nwhite or cream-colored \nto yellow, orange, \ngreen, and even light \nblue.  Squash can be \ncylindrical, bell- or\nclub-shaped, and \nsimply round or oblong.  \nAlthough wild squash is bitter, \ncultivated varieties are generally \nsweeter or bland and have a soft \nto crunchy texture when cooked.\nVarieties\nSquash is generally divided into two basic\ntypes, summer and winter, although\nseasonal distinction is no longer accurate\nbecause both types are now available  year-\nround.  Winter, or hard-shell, squash is\nallowed to mature on the plant and has\na thick rind; large, tough seeds; and dark-\nyellow to orange flesh.  Summer, or soft-\nshell, squash, which is harvested before\nit matures completely, has a more tender\nrind and lighter-colored flesh.\nWinter squash types include acorn\nsquash, shaped something like an acorn\nthat tapers at one end, with a dark-green,\nridged rind; banana squash, a large,\ncylinder-shaped squash with a thick, pale\nskin and finely textured flesh; buttercup\nsquash, a squat, dark-green vegetable with\nlighter stripes and rather dry flesh; but-\nternut squash, shaped like a long bell with\na tan rind and mild flavor; and spaghetti\nsquash, an oval, yellow variety whose\nmild, pale-yellow flesh forms crisp-tex-\ntured spaghetti-like strands when cooked.\nAmong the summer squash varieties,\nzucchini, with its mild flavor and cucumber-\nlike appearance, is the most popular in\nthe United States. Although zucchini usually\nhas a smooth, green skin, one variant, the\ngolden zucchini, has deep-yellow skin\nand a sweeter flavor. Other summer\nsquashes include the chayote, a pale-green,\npear-shaped fruit with a large central seed\nand a fairly thick, ridged skin; the patty\npan, a disk-shaped variety with a scal-\nloped edge, white to pale-green skin, and\nwhite, succulent flesh; and yellow crook-\nneck and yellow straightneck, which have\nlemon-colored skin and bulbous blossom\nends, tapering to narrow stem ends that\nare either curved or straight. Within some\nof these types are further variations.\nSquash\nFamily Cucurbitaceae\nScientific name Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita\nmaxima, Cucurbita moschata\nCommon name squash\n♥Winter squash is high in vitamin A\n(beta-carotene) and is a good source\nof potassium, fiber, and vitamin C\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe squash probably originated in\nMexico or Central America.  Although\nedible wild types are no longer known,\nrelated species with small, very bitter fruits\nare still found in this region.  Squash was\nfirst gathered by indigenous people\naround 8000 B.C., but apparently only\nthe seeds were eaten, because the fruits\nwere unappealing.  Cultivation of squash\nmay have begun around Tehuacan, south\nof Mexico City, around 3400 B.C.  From\nthere, peoples throughout North and\nSouth America adopted squash cultiva-\ntion.  By the time squash was introduced\nto Europe in the 16th century, most of\nthe modern types were already developed.\nSquash quickly became a staple in the\n260\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\ndiets of European colonists in America.\nNew England settlers adapted the word\n“squash” from several Indian names for\nthe vegetable, all of which meant “some-\nthing eaten raw.”  Both George Washington\nand Thomas Jefferson cultivated zucchini\nand other types of summer squash on\ntheir Virginia estates.  By the 19th century,\nNorth American merchant seamen were\nbringing home new varieties of squash\nfrom all over Central and South America.\nToday, squash, gourds, and pumpkins are\ngrown in many parts of the world and\nrank 11th among the leading vegetables\nof the world.  Although the United States\ndoes not produce a large volume of squash\ncommercially, many people cultivate it\nin home gardens.  California and Florida\nare the primary U.S. producers, and\nMexico and Costa Rica contribute sub-\nstantially to the U.S. supply.\nSquash is a hardy, warm-weather\nannual that grows on vines or small bushes\nwith trailing tendrils.  Seeds can be sown\nin seedbeds early in spring or directly into\nfields later in the season, after danger of\nfrost has passed, in hills of warm, well-\nfertilized soil.  Vines must be trellised to\nprovide support for the heavy fruit.\nAlthough most types of squash prefer full\nsun, winter varieties can tolerate light\nshade.  For ideal growth, the plants\nrequire considerable moisture, especial-\nly after flowering.  Most squash blossoms\nare yellow or orange, and both male and\nfemale flowers form on the same plant.\nBecause the female blooms open for only\n1 day, and only from dawn until mid-\nmorning, pollination at the right time\nand place is critical.  In addition, the\nnumber of seeds and the size and shape of\nthe fruits are determined by the amount\nof pollen deposited.  Inadequate pollina-\ntion of summer squash results in small,\nmisshapen fruit or none at all.  The first\ncrop of summer squash is ready to har-\nvest about 50 days after planting, and all\nof the fruits must be harvested at this stage\nin order for more to grow.  If the fruits\nare allowed to mature, the plants stop\nproducing.  In contrast, winter squash is\nleft on the plant until it matures, a process\nthat takes 95 to 115 days, depending on\nvariety.  All are picked after the leaves\nhave turned brown.\nUses\nWhen selecting winter squash, it is\nimportant to choose one that is heavy for\nits size and has a thick, hard shell.  If\nstored in a cool, dry place, whole winter\nsquash can keep well for several months.\nCut pieces should be tightly wrapped and\nrefrigerated.  Winter squash is always\ncooked before eating, usually after the\nfruit has been cut open and the seeds and\nfibers scooped out.  (The seeds of most\nwinter squash varieties can be dried or\nroasted and consumed as a snack.)  A\nheavy chef ’s knife or cleaver may be\nnecessary to cut the hard shell.  Halves\ncan be baked and served plain or stuffed\nwith cheese, meats, or other vegetables.\nBaking conserves the nutrients in the flesh\nand enhances its sweetness.  Some espe-\ncially tough-shelled varieties can be baked\nor steamed whole (after piercing the flesh)\nand then cut up.  Squash pieces also\ncan be boiled or steamed in broth,\nmicrowaved, or sautéed in oil.  Baked or\nsteamed winter squash is delicious\nmashed or puréed and seasoned with\nspices such as fresh ginger, curry, cinna-\nmon, cloves, or allspice or with sweeten-\ners such as brown sugar, maple syrup, or\nhoney.  Squash also can be mixed with\nonions, garlic, and herbs or with other\nvegetables such as corn, tomatoes, and\nbell peppers.  Chunks of squash can be\nadded to soups, stews, and casseroles.\nAny type of mashed or puréed winter\nsquash can be used in place of canned\npumpkin in soups, pies, cookies, or quick\nbreads.  Spaghetti squash is often served\nas a substitute for pasta, topped with\ntomato sauce, pesto, or other sauces.\nCooked squash also can be frozen for later\nuse.  To prevent squash from becoming\nwatery during cooking, lightly salt the\nraw flesh, place it on absorbent paper to\ndraw out the moisture, and rinse.\nWhen purchasing summer squash,\nsmall, firm, shiny squash that are heavy\nfor their size should be selected.  Squash\ncan be stored in perforated plastic bags\nin the refrigerator crisper.  Summer squash\ncan be eaten raw or cooked, and the tender\nskin is always left on.  Raw summer\nsquash can be sliced and added to green\nsalads or julienned to use with dips.\nGrated zucchini is used to make moist\nbreads and cakes.  Quick steaming,\ngrilling, and stir-frying are the best cook-\ning methods for conserving nutrients.\nSeveral varieties cooked together make a\ncolorful and tasty combination seasoned\nwith herbs such as dill, basil, thyme, mint,\ntarragon, marjoram, or oregano.  The\nmild flavor of summer squash comple-\nments soups, stews, casseroles, and mixed\nvegetables.  Immature summer squash is\nused as an attractive edible garnish or side\ndish.  In addition, the flowers are edible.\nNutrient composition\nWinter squash is high in vitamin A (beta-\ncarotene) and is a good source of potas-\nsium, fiber, and vitamin C.\nVegetables\n261\nThe sweet potato, a smooth-skinned, oblong or elongated tropical tuber, is not\nrelated to the white potato.  Instead, it is a member of the morning glory family.\nNor is the sweet potato a yam, which actually is a completely different vegetable.\nThe sweet potato’s smooth skin may vary from pale \nyellow to vivid orange to deep purple, depending \non the variety.  The sweet flesh may be \nlight yellow, pink, red, or deep orange.\nVarieties\nSweet potatoes are categorized into two\nbasic types.  The orange-fleshed varieties,\nwith tan to brownish red or purple skin,\na plump shape, and sweet flavor, are the most\ncommon.  The yellow-fleshed potatoes tend\nto be firmer, dryer, and less sweet and\nhave a slightly mealy texture and yellow-\nish tan to fawn-colored skins. Current\nvarieties of sweet potato include the\nBeauregard, the Garnet, the Hernandez,\nand the Jewel.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe sweet potato, a native of the tropical\nregions of the Americas, was important\nin the diet of the Aztec people of Mexico\nand the Incas of Peru.  Remains of sweet\npotatoes that are 10,000 to 20,000 years\nold have been found in Peruvian caves.\nSweet potatoes were introduced to Europe\nby Columbus, later brought to Asia by\nother explorers, and widely cultivated in\nthe American colonies, where they\nbecame a dietary staple for early settlers\nand Revolutionary War soldiers.

Its length ranges from about 5 inches to a foot or more,\nand it can be several inches wide.  Its starchy, rather dry flesh is acrid and actually\ntoxic when raw, but after \ncooking it is safe to consume \nand has a somewhat nutty \nflavor, similar to that of \npotatoes or water chestnuts.\nVarieties\nMore than 300 varieties of taro are cul-\ntivated around the world, both in water\nand in soil, and vary considerably in color\nand taste.  The two varieties of taro that\nare most important for food production\nare the globulifera, also called dasheen,\nwhich produces a large number of crisp,\neasily cut tubers (or corms), and the\nantiquorum, whose corms are tougher\nand more spongy.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nBecause taro is an important part of many\nAsian diets and rituals, the tuber may\nhave originated somewhere on that con-\ntinent.  Whatever its geographic origins,\nit is most likely one of the oldest food\nplants.  As early as 2000 B.C., taro was\nbrought from southeast Asia to the Pacific\nrim and northern Asia.  Taro is believed\nto have been brought to Hawaii between\n400 and 500 A.D. by the first Marquesan\nand Tahitian settlers.  According to\nHawaiian tradition, taro is the staff of\nlife.  Taro also was carried westward to\nArabia and was an important crop in the\nNile Valley by 500 B.C.  Today, taro is a\nstaple in the diets of the people of West\nAfrica, the Caribbean, and the Polynesian\nIslands.  It is grown throughout tropical\nand subtropical Asia and the Pacific and\nin parts of Africa and the Americas.\nTaro is a succulent perennial plant\nthat ranges in height from about 20 inch-\nes to 6 feet.  Young corms develop as off-\nshoots of the main corm and can produce\nnew plants.  Although taro is generally\nregarded as a bog plant, it can grow in a\nvariety of environments from dry ground\nto wetlands and can tolerate lighting\nconditions ranging from deep shade to\nbright sunlight. Because taro seeds and\nseedlings do not survive well and the\nplants rarely flower, propagation is done\nprimarily by planting side corms or by\ncutting off and planting the top of a large\ntuber with its shoot.\nUses\nTaro roots must  be cooked thoroughly\nto neutralize the toxic calcium oxalate\nTaro\nFamily Araceae\nScientific name Colocasia esculenta L.\nSchott\nCommon name taro\n♥Cooked taro root is a good source \nof vitamin B6 and fiber\n♥Cooked taro leaves are high in vitamin\nA and vitamin C\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup root,\n1/2 cup\ncooked\nleaves,\n(66 g)\ncooked (72 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n94\n17\nWater (%) \n64\n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n3\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n23\n3\nProtein (grams)\n0\n2\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n12\n62\nIron\n1\n1\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n319\n333\nMagnesium\n20\n15\nPhosphorus\n50\n20\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\n307 RE\nVitamin C\n3\n26\nThiamin\n0.1\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0\n0.3\nNiacin\n0\n1\nVitamin B6\n0.2\n0.1\nFolate\n13 μg\n35 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \n–\nNote:  A line (–) indicates that the nutrient value\nis not available.\ncrystals they contain.

Indeed, the name\n“tomatillo” means “little tomato” in Spanish.  Like the tomato, it belongs to the\nnightshade family and is actually a fruit.  Globular in shape and between 1 1/2 \nand 2 inches in diameter, the slightly flattened, \nshiny fruits are enclosed in light-brown \nor green, easily removed, parchment-like \ncoverings.  The tomatillo has a tangy \nlemony flavor that is difficult to \ndescribe.  It has a firmer texture \nthan the tomato, and its flesh \nis pale green or yellow, depending \non the degree of ripeness.\nVarieties\nTomatillos come in two varieties: the\nsweet and the sharp (or acidic), both of\nwhich are available in the United States.\nThe more acidic variety is also known as\nTomatilla de Milpa.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nThe tomatillo is a native of Mexico,\nalthough it also grows wild in California.\nPlants reach heights and widths of 3 to\n4 feet and have an unusual zigzag shape.\nThe leaves are long and heart-shaped, and\nthe flowers are bell-shaped.  Tomatillos\nare best adapted to warm and dry climates.\nHowever, they can be grown as far north\nas the central midwestern United States.\nIn North America, fruit production\nbegins about 70 days after the plant has\nsprouted.  Tomatillos are available year-\nround.\nUses\nThe tomatillo is almost always used while\nit is still unripe, because the tangy lemony\nflavor is lost when the fruit ripens.  Firm\nfruits that just fill the husks are best.  The\nfruit can be stored in the refrigerator\nunwashed or in a paper or plastic bag for\n3 weeks or longer.  Before use, the fruit\nshould be husked and washed to remove\nthe sticky film that covers it.  The tomatillo\nis popular in Mexican and Southwest\ncuisine.  Although it can be used raw in\nsalads, the tomatillo is usually cooked\neven when added to dishes such as salsa\ncruda (salsa made from raw vegetables),\nbecause cooking enhances the tomatillo’s\nflavor and softens its skin.  Salsa verde,\nalso made from tomatillos, is a popular\ncooked sauce with a sharp flavor that is\nexcellent for poultry and grilled meat or\nenchiladas.  Canned tomatillos also are\navailable in markets and can be used in\nrecipes that require the cooked fruit.\nNutrient composition\nTomatillos are a good source of vitamin C.\nTomatillo\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n21\nWater (%) \n92\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n1\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n4\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n5\nIron\n0\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n177\nMagnesium\n13\nPhosphorus\n26\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n7 RE\nVitamin C\n8\nThiamin\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\nNiacin\n1\nVitamin B6\n0\nFolate\n5 μg\nVitamin E\n0 \nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1/2 cup chopped, \nraw (66 g)\n264\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n26\nWater (%) \n94\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\nFat (grams)\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n6\nProtein (grams)\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n6\nIron\n1\nZinc\n0\nManganese\n0\nPotassium\n273\nMagnesium\n14\nPhosphorus\n30\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n76 RE\nVitamin C\n23\nThiamin\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0.1\nNiacin\n1\nVitamin B6\n0.1\nFolate\n18 μg\nVitamin E\n0\nTomatoes are members of the nightshade family, related to potatoes, bell peppers,\nand eggplant.  They can be red, pink, orange, or yellow, round to oblong, and\nfrom 1 to 6 inches in diameter.  \nThe flavor ranges from \nsweet to bland to tart, \ndepending on variety.\nVarieties\nTomatoes are available in three basic\ntypes: small, round cherry tomatoes;\nplump, oblong plum, or Roma, tomatoes;\nand round or globe-shaped slicing\ntomatoes, probably the sweetest and\njuiciest type.  Within each type are\nnumerous varieties, totaling about 4,000.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nAlthough the tomato is botanically a fruit,\nit is prepared and consumed as a vegetable.\nIn fact, because of a tariff dispute, the U.S.\nSupreme Court officially declared it a veg-\netable in 1893.  The word “tomato” is\nderived from the Mexican Nahuatl Indian\nword “tomatl.”  The wild form of the plant,\nwhich still flourishes in Mexico and\nCentral and South America, is similar to\nthe domestic cherry tomato.  Spanish\nexplorers to Mexico brought tomatoes back\nto Europe in the 10th century.  The first\nofficial mention of the fruit appeared in\n1544, in the work of Italian botanist\nMatthiolus, who described a yellow-fruit-\ned variety he called pomodoro, meaning\n“golden apple.”  Europeans initially regarded\ntomatoes with suspicion, because most\nSERVING\nSIZE:\n1 medium, raw (123 g)\nTomato\nTomatoes also are available in a variety\nof processed forms, including canned\nwhole, diced, and puréed.  Canned tomato\npaste is a concentrated form of the fruit’s\npulp.  Processed tomato sauce in cans or\njars is similar to purée, but with seasonings\nand sometimes fat added.\nNutrient composition\nTomatoes are a good source of vitamin A\n(carotenes) and are high in vitamin C.\nRed tomatoes also contain substantial\namounts of lycopene, an antioxidant that\nmay help protect against cancer.  The\nlycopene in cooked or processed toma-\ntoes is more easily absorbed than that in\nfresh tomatoes.\nplants of the nightshade family were\nknown to be poisonous.  The tomato was\nnot widely accepted as a food until the\nearly 19th century, although even then\ntomatoes would be cooked for hours to\nneutralize the toxins they were thought to\ncontain.  Raw tomatoes were not consumed\nuntil the late 19th century.  Today, tomatoes\nare one of the most popular vegetables in\nthe United States.\nTo increase durability and shelf life,\ntomatoes are usually picked when they\nare at the “mature green” stage.  In response\nto year-round demand, growers have\ndeveloped thicker-skinned, hardy varieties\nof tomatoes that can withstand long-\ndistance shipping.\nUses\nUnripe tomatoes can be ripened in a paper\nbag at room temperature.  Tomatoes\nshould be stored at room temperature.\nRipe tomatoes can be kept up to 2 days.\nThe most popular way to eat fresh tomatoes\nis to slice them raw and eat them in salads\nor sandwiches.\nFamily  Solanaceae\nScientific name Lycopersicon \nesculentum\nCommon name tomato\n♥High  in vitamin C\n♥A good source of vitamin A (carotenes)\n♥Contains the antioxidant lycopene\nVegetables\n265\nThe turnip is a fleshy root vegetable related to broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage,\nand the mustards.  Depending on age and variety, turnips can be round or shaped\nlike a top, range in diameter from 2 inches to over a foot, and weigh up to 50\npounds.  Their smooth skin can be white, yellow, green, or purple.  The white \nor yellow flesh of the turnip has a slightly sweet, peppery \nflavor and a crisp texture.\nVarieties\nNumerous varieties of turnips are grown\nfor harvest throughout the year.  The\nPurple Top Milan, with flat white roots\nand purple markings, matures early and\nis good for winter production, as are the\nManchester Market and the yellow-\nfleshed Golden Ball.  The Purple Top\nWhite Globe is an old variety with round\nor flat roots that are reddish purple above\nground and white below.  The Snowball\nis a fast-maturing white turnip that\ngenerally is sown in spring, while the\nTokyo Cross is an all-year crop.  The\nJapanese cultivate long, carrot-shaped\nturnips called Hinona Kabu.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nTurnips are native to Europe and central\nAsia, where they still grow wild on open\nground or next to streams.  However, they\nwere first cultivated in the Middle East\nabout 4,000 years ago.  Turnips were\nconsumed by the ancient Romans and by\nEuropeans during the Middle Ages.\nEnglish and French settlers brought\nturnips to America.  Today, turnips are\ngrown in many parts of the world, includ-\ning Canada and the United States, where\nthe leading suppliers are California and\nNew Jersey.  \nTurnips are economical and easy to\ngrow.  They thrive in almost any type of\nsoil and store well after harvest.  Seeds\ngenerally are sown in early spring as soon\nas the soil can be worked, and additional\nplantings are done every 2 weeks until\nabout 5 weeks before the temperature is\nexpected to increase to more than 80°\nFahrenheit.  In late summer, when\ntemperatures begin to cool, successive\nplantings can be started again until 3\nmonths before night temperatures\nnormally decrease to less than 20°\nFahrenheit.  Turnips are ready for harvest\nabout 70 days after planting or when the\nroots are 2 inches in diameter.\nUses\nFirm, unblemished turnips that are small\nbut heavy for their size are the best and\nsweetest.  They can be stored in perfo-\nrated plastic bags in the refrigerator\ncrisper.  Although turnips can be eaten\nraw, the larger ones may have a strong\nflavor, which can be reduced by blanch-\ning in boiling water for about 5 minutes.\nAlthough the root usually is peeled before\nuse, fresh, young turnips can be used with\nthe skins intact.  Sliced or cubed raw\nturnip adds a crunchy texture and a sweet,\npeppery flavor to green salads.  Turnips\ncan be boiled, baked, steamed, pickled,\nbraised in broth, microwaved, stir-fried\nwith other vegetables, or roasted along-\nside meat or poultry.  Cooked turnips can\nbe mashed and served like potatoes or cut\nup and included in soups, casseroles, and\nstews.  Overcooking should be avoided,\nbecause it brings out the vegetable’s strong\nflavor.  Also, turnips should not be cooked\nin aluminum or iron pots because the\nflesh can darken.\nIn Great Britain, turnips are carved\ninto jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween.\nNutrient composition\nTurnips are a good source of vitamin C.\nTurnip\nFamily Cruciferae\nScientific name Brassica rapa\nCommon name turnip\n♥A good source of vitamin C\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup,\n1/2 cup,\nraw (65g) cooked (78g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n18\n16\nWater (%) \n92\n94\nDietary fiber (grams)\n1\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n4\n4\nProtein (grams)\n1\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n20\n17\nIron\n0\n0\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n124\n105\nMagnesium\n7\n6\nPhosphorus\n18\n15\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n14\n9\nThiamin\n0\n0\nRiboflavin\n0\n0\nNiacin\n0\n0\nVitamin B6\n0.1\n0.1\nFolate\n9 μg\n7 μg\nVitamin E\n0\n0\n266\nEncyclopedia of Foods\nNutrient Content\n1/2 cup,\n1/2 cup,\ncooked (70 g) raw (62 g)\nEnergy (kilocalories)\n35\n60\nWater (%) \n87\n74\nDietary fiber (grams)\n2\n2\nFat (grams)\n0\n0\nCarbohydrate (grams)\n9\n15\nProtein (grams)\n1\n1\nMinerals (mg)\nCalcium\n3\n7\nIron\n1\n0\nZinc\n0\n0\nManganese\n0\n0\nPotassium\n83\n362\nMagnesium\n4\n14\nPhosphorus\n13\n39\nVitamins (mg)\nVitamin A\n0 RE\n0 RE\nVitamin C\n1\n2\nThiamin\n0\n0.1\nRiboflavin\n0\n0.1\nNiacin\n0\n1\nVitamin B6\n0.1\n0.2\nFolate\n4 μg\n10 μg\nVitamin E\n0\n1\nThe Chinese water chestnut is not a chestnut or even a nut, but the edible tuber\nof an aquatic plant.

Yams can range in length from a few inches to 7 1/2 feet\nand can weigh more than 100 pounds.  The rough skin is pale tan to dark brown,\nwhereas the flesh can range from off-white to yellow to purple or pink.\nDepending on the variety, the \ntexture is moist and tender \nor dry and mealy.  The flavor \nis rather bland, more similar \nto white potatoes than \nto sweet potatoes.\nVarieties\nHundreds of species of yams, all of them\nclimbing vines, are cultivated through-\nout the world.  The most widely grown\ntype is the Dioscorea alata, also called the\nwinged yam, greater yam, or white Manila\nyam, whose tubers can grow to 30 to 40\npounds in weight.  Also popular is the D.\nbatatas, or Chinese yam, a smaller tuber\nweighing 5 to 10 pounds, with a flattened\nor fan-like shape.\nOrigin & botanical facts\nYams derive their name from the Senegalese\nword nyami, which means “to eat.”  They\nare native to Africa, where they have been\ncultivated for 11,000 years, and to south-\neast Asia, where their cultivation extends\nback 10,000 years.  Along with taro, they\nmay have been the first plants to be cul-\ntivated.  The slave trade brought yams to\nCentral America and the Caribbean,\nwhere they became an important staple\ncrop.  Nevertheless, western Africa still\nproduces about half of the almost 30 mil-\nlion metric tons of yams currently grown\nin the world annually.  The rest are grown\nin Asia and Central and South America.\nVery small amounts are cultivated and\nconsumed in the United States.  Most of\nthe vegetables that are called yams in the\nUnited States are actually sweet potatoes.\nTrue yams thrive in frost-free, preferably\ntropical or subtropical climates whose\nrainfall totals at least 40 inches during\nthe 8-month growing season.  The ideal\nsoil is rich, fertile, and moist but well\ndrained.  Like potatoes, yams are easily\npropagated from the tubers themselves,\nwhich are cut into wedges containing two\nor three buds each and allowed to dry for\na day before planting.  Plants can be\ngrown in pots or planted directly into\nhills of compost mixed with sandy soil.\nBecause the tubers do not store well, it is\nbest to leave them in the ground as long\nas possible before harvest in fall or late\nwinter.\nUses\nYams can be found in Latin American\nand Asian specialty markets, usually sold\nin chunks.

They also are a flavorful\naddition to soups, casseroles, and stews\nand can take the place of mashed pumpkin\nin pies, cakes, and pastries.\nNutrient composition\nYams are a good source of vitamin C and\ndietary fiber and are high in potassium.\nGrains\nIncludes: Bread, Cereals, Flour, and Pasta\n269\nBasics\nGrains are the seeds of plants.  Although the\ngrains eaten by humans belong to a wide range\nof botanical families, they have the same\nbasic structure (see the illustration on page\n20, Chapter 2) and contain these compo-\nnents, from which plants begin to grow: \nBran — This is the outer layer of the\ngrain seed. It’s full of B vitamins, trace\nminerals, and, especially, fiber. \nEndosperm — Sometimes referred to as\nthe kernel, the endosperm contains the\nmajority of the material within the seed\nand is meant to nourish a seedling.  The\nendosperm is where most of the protein,\ncarbohydrates, and small amounts of vita-\nmins are located.  It is composed mainly of\nstarch, and often it is the only part of the\ngrain that is eaten.\nGerm — The germ is the part of the\nseed from which the new plant sprouts.  As\nthe embryo within the seed, it has the high-\nest concentration of nutrients, including B\nvitamins, trace minerals, and some pro-\nteins.  It also contains fat, which increases\nits perishability.\nGrains are usually milled before they\nare used as food.  Milling usually means\nthat the bran and any husk surrounding\nthe grain seed (along with the nutrients\nthey contain) are removed.  Then the seeds\nare ground in a process that converts the\ngrain into flour or other products.  The\nproduct’s use and name often depend on\nhow much of the bran is left.  Wheat, for\nexample, can be milled into whole-grain\nflours that contain all parts of the seed.\nRefined flours, which are used most often\nby Western nations, contain only the\nendosperm:  the bran and germ are removed\n(along with much of the grain’s nutrition).\nNearly any grain can be milled and\nmade into products such as bread, cereal,\nor pasta—food staples worldwide—with\nvarying degrees of success depending on\nthe chemistry of the grain.  History has\ntaught us which grains work best and in\nwhat combinations.\nGluten, which is found in grain protein,\ngives bread its springy texture.  It becomes\nstretchy and thickens when liquid is added\nC\nereal grains are the fruit of plants belonging to the grass family (Gramineae).  Ten thousand years ago, wheat\nunderwent spontaneous mutations causing this grass to hang onto its seed rather than scatter it to the\nwind.  Although this change was not in the interests of the wheat from the standpoint of its own reproduction,\nit enabled humans to store seed for the winter.  The calorie density of grains prevented starvation and so\nplayed an important role in human history worldwide.  In China, rice was domesticated about\n6,500 years ago, and in the New World corn was domesticated about 3,500 years ago.\nUntil the past century, most grains were consumed as “whole” grains.  In\nother words, the grain kernels were intact — not stripped of their\nvitamins, minerals, and fiber.  Whole grains provide fiber, protein,\ncomplex carbohydrates, lignans, phytates, other phytochemicals,\nvitamins, and minerals.  Fat-soluble vitamins are found in the germ\nof the grain, and B vitamins and phytochemicals are found in the\nhusk or bran.  Grain  and grain products are also naturally low in fat.\nWhole grains can be consumed plain as hot cereals, used in pilafs,\nadded to baked goods, and eaten in dozens of other ways.  Hundreds \nof products are made from grain.  Two of the main ones —bread \nand pasta — are diet staples in nearly every culture on every \ncontinent, from couscous in North Africa to soba (buckwheat\nnoodles) in Japan.  Grains and grain products literally feed the\nworld, providing most of the calories and much of the protein \nconsumed by the world’s population.  \n270\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nto the flour and the combination is kneaded.\nThe resulting gas from the fermentation of\nthe carbohydrate in the flour is trapped by\nthe dough, causing the gluten to stretch\nand, thus, the bread to rise. Because wheat\nand rye contain the highest quantities of\ngluten, flour made from these grains has\nproved best suited for making bread.  Other\ngrains, such as corn, have less gluten, and\nproducts made from them are more crumbly.\nIn most countries, the highest propor-\ntion of cultivated land is devoted to grains.\nCrops such as wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats,\nand millet remain critical components in\nthe diets of people worldwide.  Wheat is\namino acids (the building blocks of protein)\nthat your body needs.  However, grains also\ndo not have the twin disadvantages of\nanimal-based protein—saturated fat and\ncholesterol, both of which are linked to\ncardiovascular disease.  Grains can be eaten\nin combination with other foods—such as\nlegumes, small servings of meat or poultry,\nand dairy foods—to provide the complete\nbalance of amino acids.\nImportant minerals found in whole grains\nare iron, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc.\nWhole grains are also a source of B vitamins\n(niacin, thiamin, riboflavin) and antioxidants,\nsuch as vitamin E and selenium.  Scientists\nthe most widely grown grain.  But, because\nmultiple crops of rice can be grown in a\nyear in tropical areas, a nearly equal amount\nof rice and wheat are grown each year. \nNutrition\nThe mix of nutrients supplied by grains\nvaries.  But because grain seeds are com-\nposed mostly of starch, between 65 and 90\npercent of the calories supplied by grains\nare carbohydrates.  Between 8 percent and\n15 percent of calories come from protein,\nand fat contributes the remainder of the\ncalories.  Because grains are plant-based\nproteins, they do not supply all of the\nare just beginning to explore the health role\nof substances called “phytochemicals,”\nwhich are also found in whole grains. \nGrains are rich in dietary fiber, both\ninsoluble fiber (which helps bowel function\nand may reduce the risk of some kinds of\ncancer) and soluble fiber (which may have\na role in lowering blood cholesterol levels).\nThe refining and processing of grains\nremove many of the nutrients grains natu-\nrally provide.  The bran and the nutrients\nit contains are often removed during the\nmilling process.  Refined wheat flour has\nboth the bran and the germ removed.\nMany grain products are enriched (see\nChapter 4, “Fortified” and “Enriched,” page\n92), meaning nutrients originally found in\nthe grain are added back to the product\nduring processing.  But not all the nutrients\nare returned. Insoluble fiber is milled away\nwhen the bran is removed, and antioxidants\nusually are not added back into refined\nflours.  Phytochemicals also may be missing\nin refined products.\nThe bottom line is that even though\nrefined grains are a good source of many\nnutrients, whole grains are better.  You can\ntell whether a product is made from whole\ngrain by checking the ingredient listing of\nthe label. Look for the words “whole grain,”\nindicating that the product contains the\nendosperm, bran, and germ, and all the\nbenefits they bring.\nSelection\nGrains, even those that have been processed\nor lightly cooked, contain some of their\nnatural oils.  Over time, they may go rancid,\nwhich is why ensuring freshness when\nbuying them is key.  Look for grains that\nare in sealed packages.  This protects them\nfrom air, moisture, and spoilage.  Some may\nhave freshness or “best if used by” dates to\nhelp ensure quality.  If you are buying in\nGrains\n271\nCooking times vary depending on the\nkind of grain used, how it has been\nprocessed, and whether it has been pre-\ncooked (bulgur and kasha are often lightly\ncooked, then dried before they are sold in\nstores).  Most cooks recommend cooking\nwhole grains as you would pasta.  Simply\ncook them until tender—a time that may\nrange from 8 minutes for “instant” types of\nwhite rice to more than an hour for whole\nwheat or other unmilled grains. \nSome grains that are particularly\ntough—such as wheat or rye—may be\neasier to cook if they are first soaked.\nRinsing whole grains before cooking also\nis advised to remove debris or other residues. \nThe text that follows provides more\ndetailed information about specific grains\nand the foods made from them.  The\nchapter is organized into two sections:\n•\nGrains\n•\nGrain Products\nbulk, check whether the store has a rapid\nturnover of that particular product.  There\nmay not be a great demand for bulgur in\nsupermarkets, for example, and so the prod-\nuct may have been on the shelf for some\ntime.  In contrast, specialty food markets\nor those specializing in natural foods may\nhave greater demand for the product, sell\nmore of it, and therefore have a fresher\nproduct.  Grains also should smell fresh\nand appear clean and free of debris.\nStorage\nBecause grains may attract insects or may\nbecome moldy if they become moist, keep\nthem in tightly closed, moisture-proof\ncontainers.  Grains can be stored at room\ntemperature, but they will remain fresh\nlonger if stored in the refrigerator, where\nthey will keep for several months.  Most\ngrains can be kept much longer if stored in\nthe freezer.  They do not need to be thawed\nbefore cooking.  Cooked grain may be\nstored in the refrigerator for several days\nand then reheated.\nPreparation\nWhole grains are hard and dry.  Thus, cook-\ning involves not only heating them but also\nrehydrating them.  For that reason, whole\ngrains, with few exceptions, are cooked in\nliquid.  Here’s a traditional method for\ndoing so:\n•\nBring water (or other liquid, such as a\nstock) to a boil. Many cooks use a ratio of\ntwo to three parts water to one part grain.\n•\nAdd grains and other seasonings.\n•\nCover mixture and reduce to a simmer.\n•\nSimmer until most of the liquid is\nabsorbed.\n•\nRemove mixture from heat and drain\nexcess liquid if necessary. Let sit for approx-\nimately 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.\nBEYOND THE BASICS\nInnovative uses of grains include the\nproduction of modified starches, caloric\nsweeteners, and fat substitutes.  Beta-\nglucan, a fat-like gel made from enzyme-\ntreated oat bran, is sold as a cholesterol-\nlowering fat replacement, although more\ntesting is needed to determine its effec-\ntiveness.  Several food enzymes are pro-\nduced by fermentation based on grain.\nWheat gluten may be used to produce\nflavor enhancers such as glutamate or\ndiet supplements such as glutamine.\nThere is also a vast range of industrial\napplications.  None of these, however,\nare likely to overtake in importance the\nrole of grains in feeding the world. \nGrains\nAmaranth\nAmaranth was one of the main food sources\nfor the Aztecs, who also used it in religious\nrituals.  Cultivation ended almost com-\npletely after Spanish conquistadors made\ngrowing the plant a punishable offense.\nToday, both farmers and anyone interested\nin nutrition are showing increasing interest\nin the plant because it has more protein (15\npercent to 18 percent of calories) than most\nother grains (8 to 15 percent of calories).\nIt also contains more lysine and methionine,\namino acids not provided by many com-\nmon grains.  Combined with other grains,\nit can provide a complete balance of amino\nacids.  Amaranth is also a source of calcium\nand magnesium and contains more iron\nthan almost any other grain.\nThe amaranth plant has long clusters\nof red flowers and grows to a height of 1 to\n3 feet.  It produces tiny seeds—up to\n500,000 per plant.  These seeds can be\ncooked and eaten as a grain or popped,\nsprouted, or ground into flour that has a\nstrong, nutty flavor.  Amaranth flour can\nrange from a light yellow to dark violet,\nalthough most amaranth flour sold in stores\nis buff-colored. \nPasta can be made from amaranth flour,\nand amaranth oil is obtained from the\nplant’s seeds.  The green leaves and stalk of\namaranth (also called pigweed) can be\ncooked and eaten.  The leaves have a taste\nsimilar to that of spinach.\nPreparation Tips\nAmaranth flour does not contain gluten,\nwhich means baked goods containing it will\nnot rise as desired and will be crumbly.  It\ncan be used in baked goods, but it should be\ncombined with wheat flour (which contains\ngluten) in recipes for muffins, bread, cookies,\n272\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\ntaste, its banishment from many nations’\nkitchens is something to reconsider.\nBarley has a tough husk surrounding the\ngrain seed which must be removed before\nit is edible.  Barley is a source of soluble\nfiber, niacin, phosphorus, magnesium,\nand iron.\nBarley grains are usually off-white, but\nthe color may range from black to purple.\nHow the grain is milled determines its\nnutritional content.  Nutrients are most\nconcentrated near the bran.  Therefore, the\nmore milling the barley undergoes, the less\nnutritious it is.\nTypes of barley sold in stores include:\nFlaked barley—As its name suggests,\nbarley flakes are grains that have been flat-\ntened. They resemble rolled oats. \nPot barley or Scotch barley—This type\nof barley is coarsely ground, but it loses\nmost of its nutrients because almost the\nentire husk is removed.\nPearled barley—So-named because\nprocessed barley grains are the same size as\npearls and ivory-colored, pearled barley is\nprocessed multiple times to scour or polish\noff the outer husk and the bran.  The result\nis a barley that cooks much more quickly\nthan other types of barley.\nHulled barley—Hulled barley has only\nthe outer husk removed and still contains\nmost of its bran.  This makes it one of the\nmost nutritious types of barley available.\nBarley flour—Barley flour is simply\nbarley grains ground very fine.  It is darker\nthan refined white flour and has a delicate,\nnutty flavor. \nSupermarkets typically do not carry a\nwide variety of barley products, although\npearled barley and prepared barley soups\nare easy to find.  Health food stores or\nspecialty food markets are more likely to\ncarry less refined barley products.\nor pastries.  Because it has a nutty, assertive\nflavor, you may want to experiment some-\nwhat with how much amaranth flour to add\nto recipes.  Amaranth’s nutritional advan-\ntages, however, make adding it to baked\ngoods worthwhile.\nAmaranth seeds also can be cooked (see\nPreparation Tips, page 273) and eaten as a\ncereal.  Or, they can be popped by adding\nthem a tablespoon at a time to a hot,\nungreased skillet.  They take just a few min-\nutes to pop.\nServing Suggestions\nIn addition to using amaranth in baked\ngoods as described above, amaranth can\nbe substituted for flour in pancake or waffle\nrecipes.  Cinnamon particularly comple-\nments its flavor in both of these breakfast\nfavorites.  Amaranth leaves can be substi-\ntuted for spinach in salads or cooked\ndishes.  Popped amaranth seeds can be used\nas a garnish or topping or in breading\nrecipes.\nBarley\nBarley, an annual plant that grows to a height\nof 1 to 4 feet, is hardy enough to withstand\nvarious growing conditions.  For this reason,\nthroughout history it has been cultivated\nas a food crop and remains a staple in many\nnations, particularly in North Africa, the\nMiddle East, and Asia.  Today, however, much\nof the barley produced in Western nations\nis fed to animals or used in the production\nof beer or distilled liquor.  An enzyme in\nmalt made from barley transforms the\nstarch in beer or liquor mashes into sugars\nthat alcohol-producing yeast can feed on\nand, therefore, ferment, a process that leads\nto the production of alcohol.\nGiven the health benefits of barley, its\nversatility, and its pleasing, lightly nutty\nPreparation Tips\nLess refined barley should be soaked several\nhours before cooking.  Generally, these\ntypes of barley are cooked for about an hour\nover low heat in 3 or 4 cups of water for\neach cup of barley.  Refined types of barley,\nsuch as pearled barley, do not need to be\nsoaked and can be cooked in about a half\nhour.  Barley flour has a low gluten content.\nIt must be combined with higher-gluten\nflours (such as wheat) in baked goods or\nthey will not rise as desired. \nServing Suggestions\nBarley can be substituted for rice in many\nrecipes or combined with beans and\nvegetables to provide a high-protein meal\nwithout meat.  Barley readily absorbs the\nflavors of the liquid it is cooked in, and thus\nit is an excellent addition to soups and\nstews, where it also acts as a thickening\nagent.  Barley also can be served on its own\nas a hot cereal—it is excellent topped off\nby plain yogurt and fruit.  Barley makes an\nexcellent base for an entrée at lunch or\ndinner when cooked in chicken, beef, or\nvegetable stock and then mixed with\nsteamed vegetables. \nGrains\n273\nis added to other cereal flours to improve\nnutritional quality, and it is often an ingre-\ndient in snack foods.  Recent studies have\nlinked various phytochemicals in buck-\nwheat with potential health benefits.  Rutin,\na flavonoid found in buckwheat bran, is\nbeing studied for a possible role in manag-\ning blood cholesterol levels.  Fagopyritols\nfound in buckwheat may have a favorable\neffect on blood glucose levels in people with\ntype 2 diabetes.  Regular consumption of\nbuckwheat also has been shown to lower\nblood pressure.  However, further research\nis necessary to confirm these benefits.\nPreparation Tips\nBecause buckwheat flour is gluten-free, it\nmust be mixed with flours that contain\ngluten, such as wheat flour, in baked goods.\nOtherwise, the foods will not rise as desired.\nTo prepare kasha, add 1 cup of buckwheat\ngroats to a heated skillet and add to it a\nbeaten egg white.  The egg separates the\nkernels as they cook, which prevents the\ngroats from sticking together.  This ensures\nthat kasha will have a consistency that is\nsimilar to that of rice.  Stir the kasha and\negg mixture until each grain is separate and\ndry.  Then, add 2 cups of boiling liquid—\neither stock or water—and a dash of salt.\nSimmer the mixture for 30 minutes or until\nthe liquid is absorbed.\nServing Suggestions\nTraditionally, buckwheat has been used\nmainly as a flour in pancake mixes.  Ways\nto enjoy buckwheat are in the forms of soba,\nwhich is a Japanese noodle, and cooked\nbuckwheat groats as a salad or pilaf.\nCorn (Maize)\nAlthough considered by many to be a\nvegetable, corn is actually one of the few\nBuckwheat\nFrom a botanical standpoint, buckwheat is\na fruit and is in the same plant family as\nrhubarb.  However, it is processed, prepared,\nand consumed like cereal grains such as\nwheat, rye, and oats.\nBuckwheat products have a strong,\nnutlike flavor and include the following:\nBuckwheat flours—As the name\nsuggests, these are flours ground from the\nbuckwheat seed.  Supreme buckwheat flour\nis milled from whole buckwheat.  Fancy\nbuckwheat flour is milled from hulled buck-\nwheat seeds.  Buckwheat flour is commonly\nused to make pancakes, but it has a variety\nof other uses. \nFarinetta—This is simply a product\nmade from the bran of buckwheat seeds.\nBuckwheat groats—Groats are hulled\nbuckwheat kernels that have been crushed.\nGroats that are roasted are known as kasha,\na name given to this product in Eastern\nEuropean countries, where it has been a\nstaple for centuries.\nNutritionally, buckwheat has unique\ncharacteristics.  The protein quality of buck-\nwheat is higher than that of wheat, soy, oats,\nor brown rice.  For this reason, buckwheat\nGRAIN GLOSSARY\nWhole grains—The least processed grains.

It\ncan be served fresh and still on the cob.\nCanning or freezing can preserve fresh\nkernels.  Dried kernels can be roasted or\npopped.\nCorn can be ground into coarse meal\nor flour that is made into cornbread,\ntortillas, pancakes, or waffles.  Oil derived\nfrom corn is used widely for cooking.\nStarch derived from corn is often used as a\nthickening agent in gravies, soups, and\nother dishes.  Tiny baby corn is popular in\nAsian dishes and is sold in cans or jars.\nCorn is also fermented and is the basis for\nbourbon and whiskey.\nThe ever-popular cornflake cereal was\ninvented by the Kellogg brothers of cereal\nfame in 1894.  According to legend, they\ndiscovered the process of making cornflakes\nby accident when they passed corn kernels\nthat had been left too long in cooking water\nthrough rollers, resulting in flakes. \nAlthough corn is the fundamental food\nplant of the United States, most of the crop\nis used for feeding animals or for manu-\nfacturing purposes.  Corn grown for those\npurposes is often referred to as “field” corn.  \ngrains native to the Western Hemisphere,\nwhere it has been cultivated for centuries.\nIn Europe, the word “corn” is the common\nterm used to describe many cereal grains.\nHowever, after coming to the New World,\nEuropeans began to use the word “maize”\nto refer to corn itself.  The word “maize” is\nderived from the American Indian word\n“mahiz.”  To this day, Europeans call corn\n“maize,” and Americans call it “corn.”\nCorn plants grow to a height of 6 to 10\nfeet.  The tall plants, with their long, droop-\ning leaves, are a common sight throughout\nthe U.S. Midwest, where most of the\nworld’s supply is grown.  The plant pro-\nduces ears of corn that measure 6 to 12\ninches, and each ear has numerous long,\nslender threads called silk.  Corn kernels\ncan be white, orange, red, purple, blue,\nblack, or brown, according to the variety.\nMost of the corn grown today is a golden\nyellow.\nCorn has a wide range of uses and,\nalthough less nutritious than many grains,\nit is extremely versatile and still a good\nfood choice.  Nutritionally speaking for\nhumans, corn provides a good source of\nfiber, phosphorus, vitamin C, and thiamin.\nNumerous hybrid varieties of corn have\nbecome available in the past decades.\nPreparation Tips \nThe key to serving corn on the cob is to\nbuy the freshest possible.  When the ear is\nplucked from the stalk, the natural sugar\nin it begins a gradual conversion to starch,\nwhich makes the corn less sweet and, there-\nfore, less tasty.  Look for husks around the\near of corn that are green, plump, tightly\nwrapped, and free of any obvious insect\ninfestation.  Before buying corn, peel back\nthe husk slightly to check for plump, pale,\nand moist-looking kernels.  At home, the\ngreen husk and silk are usually removed\nbefore cooking.  Traditionally, corn on the\ncob is cooked by placing ears in a pot of\nboiling water for 4 to 7 minutes or in a\nvegetable steamer for 4 to 6 minutes.  Corn\non the cob also can be cooked in a\nmicrowave oven.  To do so, wrap each\nhusked ear in waxed paper and place on a\npaper towel.  Cook on the highest power\nsetting for 3 to 5 minutes for one ear, 5 to\n7 minutes for two ears, and 9 to 12 min-\nutes for four ears.  Corn on the cob can be\nroasted in its husk on the grill or in the\noven.  (The silk must first be removed, how-\never, and the husk replaced after this is\ndone.)  Before roasting, soak the ear in water\nfor about 5 minutes.  Then place the corn\non the grill or in the oven.  Cooking times\nvary but range from 10 to 15 minutes on a\nhot grill or 20 to 30 minutes in an oven set\nat 350° Fahrenheit.\nAvoid corn that is sold in displays\nexposed to direct sunlight or high temper-\natures because heat speeds up the process\nof converting sugar to starch. \nServing Suggestions\nInstead of flavoring corn with butter or salt,\ntry other seasonings.  Pepper, herbs, or\nlemon juice complement corn’s flavor\nwithout adding unnecessary sodium, fat,\nor calories.  Corn also mixes well with other\nvegetables.  Popped corn (see sidebar:\nPutting the “Pop” in Popcorn, this page)\nmakes an excellent snack as long as it is not\ndrenched in butter and salt. \nFlax\nFlax is an ancient crop.  Native to Eurasia,\nits first recorded use was in Babylon about\n3000 B.C.  There, it was cultivated for food,\nand its seeds were usually ground into flour\nor meal.  The plant also was used to make\nfabric for clothing.  (These days, linen\ncomes from flax.)  Hippocrates, the ancient\nGreek physician, wrote of using flaxseed\nfor the relief of abdominal pain.  The\ngreatest of all medieval kings, Charlemagne,\nconsidered flax so healthful that he passed\nlaws requiring its consumption.\nNutrition researchers have identified\nseveral substances in flaxseed that appear\nto have health benefits: lignans, fiber, and\nomega-3 fatty acids.  Lignans are phyto-\nestrogens that are thought to bind to estro-\ngen receptors in the body.  Phytoestrogens\nmay have a role in preventing hormonally\nrelated cancers of the breast, endometrium\n(lining of the uterus), and prostate.\nPopulations with higher intakes of phyto-\nestrogens appear to have a lower incidence\nof and mortality from these cancers.\nAlthough lignans are found in most unre-\nfined grains, soybeans, and some vegeta-\nbles (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and\nspinach), flaxseed is the richest source of\nlignans.  Flaxseed also contains both soluble\nand insoluble fiber (about 3.3 grams of total\nfiber in 1 tablespoon of flaxseed).  About\none-third of the fiber is soluble.  Studies\nhave found that the soluble fiber in flaxseed,\nlike that found in oat bran and fruit pectin,\ncan help lower cholesterol levels.  Soluble\nfiber also has been found to help regulate\nblood sugar levels.  The remaining two-\nGrains\n275\nPreparation Tips\nIncorporating flaxseed into a diet is sim-\nple and can add a tasty twist to routine\nfoods and dishes.  Whole (or ground)\nflaxseed can replace some of the flour in\nbread, muffin, pancake, and cookie\nrecipes.  Because of its high fat content, it\nalso can be used to replace part or all of\nthe fat in baked goods recipes.  (One cup\nof flaxseed may replace 1/3 cup fat.)  Time\nin the oven should be adjusted to allow\nfor more rapid browning when flaxseed is\nused in baked goods.  Flaxseed oil also is\nreadily available and may be substituted\nfor other oils.\nServing Suggestions\nWhole flaxseeds have a nutty taste and can\nbe sprinkled over salads, soups, yogurt, or\ncereals.  Flaxseed meal particularly com-\nplements the flavor of bran muffins.\nthirds of the fiber in flaxseed is insoluble,\nwhich aids in digestion and waste elimina-\ntion.\nFlaxseed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid,\nwhich is both an essential fatty acid and an\nomega-3 fatty acid.  Researchers are inter-\nested in omega-3 fatty acids for their roles\nin proper infant growth and development,\nin reducing risk factors for heart disease\nand stroke (regulation of cholesterol, triglyc-\nerides, blood pressure, blood clotting), and\nin immune and inflammatory disorders.\nGround flaxseed is usually available in\nmost large supermarkets and in specialty\nmarkets.  The small, reddish brown whole\nseeds have a nutty taste.  Look for flaxseed\nor flaxseed meal in tight packaging that\ndoes not allow light to pass through.\nProtecting flaxseed from light helps keep\nthe product fresh and preserves the omega-\n3 fatty acids and polyunsaturated fats.\nPUTTING THE “POP” IN POPCORN\nPopcorn is a special hard variety of dried corn that pops open and puffs when it is\nheated. The kernel has enough internal moisture to become steam, and the kernel\nexplodes because the steam has nowhere to go.  Different types of popcorn can be\ndifferent colors.  Once popped, though, they’re all white or yellow.\nPopcorn is an excellent snack food.  It is high in complex carbohydrates, a\nsource of some fiber, and, depending on how it is\nserved, low in fat and calories.  When pur-\nchasing microwave popcorn, check\nlabels for saturated fat content.\nTry to buy reduced-fat or “lite”\nvarieties.  Try popping your\nown and seasoning it with a\npinch of salt instead of\nadding unnecessary fat and\ncalories by drizzling butter over\nthe popcorn.  Alternative season-\nings include onion or garlic powders \nor reduced-fat grated cheese. \n276\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\ncuisine.  In the United States, sorghum\nmolasses is used as syrup at the table and\nin baked goods.  Teff was grown almost\nexclusively in Ethiopia until the past decade,\nwhen it was introduced in Western markets.\nOften thought of as a “famine food,” teff\nis also grown and distributed by humani-\ntarian agencies to relieve world hunger.\nMillet has a strong, nutty flavor that\nmay take some time to appreciate.  Finely\nground millet is used by Ethiopians to make\nfermented, spongy flat bread, by Indians\nto make crepe-like roti, and by the Masai in\nAfrica to make beer.  Nutritionally, millet\nis a good source of niacin, thiamin, phos-\nphorus, and zinc and provides a fair amount\nof iron.  It also is easy to digest. \nPreparation Tips\nMillet’s preparation is similar to that of\nrice—it is boiled in water.  Ground millet\nis used as flour to make puddings, breads,\nand cakes.  Because millet produces no\ngluten, it cannot be used on its own to\nmake raised breads.\nServing Suggestions\nMillet can be used as a substitute for many\nother grains.  It can be served as a hot cereal\nand in dishes such as pilaf. Like barley, millet\ncan be added to soups and stews. \nOats\nOats grow best in cool, moist climates and\nthrive in poor soils.  Given these advantages,\nit is understandable why oats have been a\nfood source for both humans and animals\nfor centuries.  There are several hundred\nvarieties of oats, which are divided into\ntwo classes:  winter and summer oats.\nWhole oat grains are usually  “hairy” and\ncan vary from white and yellow to gray,\nred, or black.  The grains, which are small\nand shaped like a thin, elongated football,\nare cleaned, dried, and roasted, and the\nhull (the tough outer covering) is removed.\nThe bran and the germ, however, are left\nintact, which means that they keep most\nof their original nutrients.  Oats are\nespecially rich in the soluble fiber beta-\nglucan, which may play a role in reducing\nblood cholesterol, blood pressure, and\nblood sugar levels.  Oats are also a source of\nantioxidants.\nDifferent types of processed oats and\noat products include the following:\nOat groats—whole oats that have been\nhulled and roasted. Groats take about 30\nto 40 minutes to cook.\nSteel-cut oats—Whole oats that have\nbeen roasted and then cut into bits. This\nreduces cooking time to about 15 minutes.\nThey are sometimes known as Scottish or\nIrish oats or pinhead oats.\nOld-fashioned rolled oats—These are\noat kernels that are steamed and then\nDID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF…\nWhat Is Hominy?\nHominy is the starchy endosperm of maize (corn) kernels.  It can be thought of\nas the “naked” kernels that remain after the tough hull (pericarp) and oily germ\nhave been removed.\nThe hull is removed by soaking corn kernels in water mixed with lime, lye, or wood\nashes.  This process not only loosens the hulls but also unbinds the vitamin niacin\nand makes it absorbable in the digestive tract.  In its dry form, hominy is sold either\ncracked (samp) or ground (grits).  Hominy also is sold canned and ready to eat.\nIn Mexico, a form of corn similar to hominy is used to make tortillas.  Annual \nconsumption of corn in Mexico is about 400 pounds per person (about 1 pound\nper day), and it provides up to 70 percent of a person’s daily calorie intake.\nIn the United States, the most common form of hominy is called grits.  Grits \nare cooked with water or milk until thick and mushy.  Often eaten as porridge \nor a side dish or in a casserole, grits are served hot or chilled and sometimes cut\ninto squares and fried. \nHominy is a good source of complex carbohydrates and soluble fiber. \nMillet\nMillet is the oldest of grains.  And although\nit is often used in the United States as bird\nfeed, millet is one of the main food sources\nfor many developing nations.\nThere are many different species of\nmillet, which is tiny, has an oblong-spherical\nshape, and ranges from pale yellow to reddish\norange.  Unlike most grains, which form\nears, most varieties of millet form panicles,\nor berry-shaped heads.  Millet berries are\nsmall and range from white, gray, or yellow\nto red or reddish brown.  Common millet\nis grown worldwide and is used mainly for\nhuman consumption and animal feed.\nFoxtail millet is also grown in a variety of\nareas and is often used for birdseed or, in\nRussia, to make beer. Pearl millet is grown\nprimarily in India.\nVarieties that are more familiar to North\nAmericans include sorghum and teff.\nSorghum is widely grown in the American\nSouth and included there in regional\nflattened into flakes to allow them to be\ncooked more quickly.\nQuick-cooking oats—These are flat-\ntened oats cut more finely to reduce cook-\ning time.\nInstant oatmeal—Cooked merely by\nadding boiling water, these oats of conve-\nnience are pre-cooked in the manufacturing\nprocess and rolled very thin to make cook-\ning even quicker.  A trade-off may be that\nthese oats are less flavorful.  In addition,\nflavorings, salt, and sugar are often added to\ninstant oatmeal. \nOat flour—Flour made from oats is also\navailable and can be combined with wheat\nflour in breads and other leavened foods.\nOat bran—This is a fine meal made\nfrom the outer layers of the grain. It can be\npurchased and used separately, but it may\nbe a part of other oat products. \nPreparation Tips\nOld-fashioned oats and quick-cooking oats\nusually can be interchanged in recipes.\nInstant oats, however, are not interchange-\nable because the additional processing they\nundergo softens the oats so much that,\nwhen combined with liquid, they can make\nbaked goods mushy or gooey.  Most types\nof processed oats are cooked by simmering\nthem in water (steel-cut oats require two\nparts water for one part oats; for all other\ntypes of oats, use one part water for one part\noats ) until they are softened and cooked.\nOat flour contains minimal gluten and\nmust be mixed with other types of flour so\nthat baked goods will rise as desired.  Using\noat flour results in baked goods that are\noften more dense than similar products\nmade with other flours.\nServing Suggestions\nAll types of processed oats make a terrific\nhot cereal.  Oats are also one of the main\nGrains\n277\ngrains in granola (and many snack foods).\nUnfortunately, granola and many snack\nfoods are high in fat, particularly saturated\nfats, the type linked to cardiovascular disease.\nThis can offset the health benefits of oats.\nOats can be added to muffins, cookies, and\nbread for a different texture.  Some types\nof European soup and stew recipes call for\noats as thickening agents.  Steel-cut oats\ncan be added to some scone recipes for addi-\ntional crunch and a nutty flavor.\nQuinoa\nIt is hailed as the super grain of the future,\nbut the accolades are a little misleading.\nQuinoa (a name supposedly derived from\nthe Spanish word for “fantastic”) is not really\na grain.  It is the fruit of a plant that belongs\nto the same botanical family as beets.  The\nquinoa plant reaches a height of 3 to 10\nfeet and produces flat, pointed seeds that\nrange from buff to russet to black. \nSo why all the praise for quinoa?\nQuinoa is relatively easy to cultivate and\nwithstands poor soil conditions and alti-\ntude.  It also packs a nutritional punch in\nits tiny seeds.  It contains more protein than\nmost grains and offers a more evenly bal-\nanced array of amino acids, the building\nblocks of protein.  It is higher in minerals,\nsuch as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,\npotassium, copper, zinc, and iron, than\nmany grains.\nQuinoa seeds can be cooked or ground\ninto flour.  Several types of pasta are made\nfrom quinoa flour.  The leaves of the plant\nalso are edible, and the seeds can be sprouted\nand eaten.\nPreparation Tips\nQuinoa is cooked in the same way as rice,\nalthough it cooks in about half the time.\nIts flavor is delicate, and some describe it\nas hazelnut-like.  Before cooking, it is\nimportant to rinse quinoa seeds until the\nwater runs clear.  They are covered with a\nbitter, powdery resin that can result in\nan unpleasant taste if it is not removed.\nQuinoa flour has a low gluten content.  It\ncannot be used alone in baked goods\nbecause they will not rise properly.\nServing Suggestions\nQuinoa is cooked like rice and makes an\nexcellent substitute for it.  “Toasting” the\nquinoa grains in a hot skillet before boil-\ning gives it a roasted flavor.  Adding cooked\nvegetables and fresh herbs also complements\nits delicate flavor.  Quinoa flour can be used\nin many baked goods.  Quinoa also makes\nan excellent hot cereal and can be added to\nsoups and stews.  Quinoa pasta is cooked\nand used like traditional types of pasta.\nRice\nMost typically viewed as a side dish in Western\nnations, rice is the main entrée when the\nrest of the world sits down to eat, providing\nup to half the calories in a typical daily diet\nin many Asian countries.  Rice is also a\nstaple in Africa.\nMost of the world’s rice is grown in\nAsia.  The plant, which grows from 8 to 12\nfeet in height, can withstand a wide range\nof climate conditions, but it grows best in\nhot, humid areas.  Branching stems from\nthe plant produce flowers, which form the\nrice grains when fertilized.  There are more\nthan 8,000 varieties of rice.\nRice is commercially classified by its\ngrain size:\nShort-grain (round-grain) rice—Short-\ngrain rice is round or oval and less than 1/5\ninch long.  It has a higher starch content\nthat results in this rice being sticky after\ncooking.  This kind of rice is also called\n278\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nItalian dishes, and aromatic rices.  Generally,\naromatic rices—sometimes referred to as\nperfumed rices—are long-grain types of\nrice and have a distinct flavor typically com-\npared to that of popcorn or nuts.  Basmati\nrice has a nut-like aroma and a rich, buttery\nflavor.  It is widely used in Indian and\nPakistani cuisine.  Jasmine rice is cultivated\nprimarily in Southeast Asia and has a soft\ntexture.  Glutenous, or sweet, rice has a\nhigh starch content and is used in Asian\ncooking to thicken sauces and make\ndumplings and for some types of desserts.\nRice also can be milled into fine, powdery\nflour, which can be used in baked goods.\nStore rice in an airtight container.  Brown\nrice, which naturally contains oil, keeps for\nabout 6 months, but it is subject to rancidity.\nIts shelf life can be extended, however, by\nstoring it in the refrigerator in an airtight\ncontainer.  White rice can keep for up to a\nyear.  Cooked rice can be stored in the refrig-\nerator for several days, but it will last for 6 to\n8 months when kept in the freezer.\nPreparation Tips \nPreparation varies according to the type of\nrice used.  In general, however, rice is\nhave been partially cooked and then dried,\nare available.\nWhite rice is the most popular form of\nrice.  One reason is that the milling process,\nwhich removes the husk, bran, and germ,\nmakes the rice cook more rapidly and extends\nits shelf life.  Unfortunately, it’s also the least\nnutritious form of rice.  In Western nations,\nrice is enriched, meaning nutrients such as\niron, niacin, riboflavin, and thiamin are\nreturned to the rice before it is sold to con-\nsumers.  Parboiled rice has been processed to\npreserve some of the nutrients during milling. \nInstant rice is white rice that has been\nmilled, cooked, and then dehydrated.  It\ntakes about 5 minutes to cook, and its\nnutritional content is generally equivalent\nto that of white rice because most instant\nrice is enriched. \nSpecialty types of rice include arborio\nrice, which is round white rice used in\npearl or glutenous rice (although there is\nno gluten in it).\nMedium-grain rice—Medium-grain\nrice is up to 1/4 inch in length.  It remains\nfirm and light when cooked and retains\nmore moisture than long-grain rice. \nLong-grain rice—This rice is more than\n1/4 inch in length.  The grains are much\nlonger than they are wide.  They tend to\nremain separate when cooked and are drier\nthan shorter-grain rice.  Most rice grown\nin the United States is long-grain rice.\nEach type of rice comes in both brown\nand white forms.  Brown rice has only the\ntough, fibrous hull removed from the rice\ngrain during processing.  Because of this,\nit retains most of its nutrients, which\ninclude fiber (bran), potassium, phosphorus,\nand trace minerals.  It also is chewier, has a\nstronger flavor, and takes longer to cook.\nQuick-cooking forms of brown rice, which\nThe delicate flavor of quinoa\nmixes well with cooked vegetables\nand fresh herbs.\nINFUSING RICE WITH FLAVOR\nExtra flavor can easily be added to\nrice as it cooks.  One way is to take\nthe desired spice or herb, mix it with\na small amount of cooking oil\n(about a teaspoon or less), and add it\nto the water just before adding the\nrice.  Spices and herbs also can be\nadded to rice after it is cooked.\nSpices and herbs that pair well with\nrice include cumin, caraway, basil,\ncilantro, mint, and parsley. \ncooked by adding it to liquid (two parts water\nto one part rice) and then simmering it until\nthe liquid is absorbed.  Both brown rice\nand parboiled rice may require longer cook-\ning times; brown rice may need to simmer\nfor up to 40 minutes, for example.\nCooks differ about whether rice should\nbe rinsed before cooking.  Some believe\nthat rinsing rice prevents stickiness.\nHowever, rinsing domestic rice can wash\noff nutrients added during processing.  A\nquick tip:  to prevent stickiness, don’t stir\nthe rice while you are cooking it.  Cooking\nrice in a vegetable, beef, or chicken stock\nis a low-fat, low-calorie way to add flavor\nto rice before serving.  Rice flour is gluten-\nfree.  It must be combined with higher-\ngluten flours (such as wheat) in baked goods\nor they will not rise as desired.  \nServing Suggestions\nFew grains are as versatile or well loved as\nrice.  It can be served as a pilaf, which can\nbe jazzed up by adding cut-up vegetables\nand seasonings.  Rice can be added to soups,\nstuffings, and salads.  In particular, it makes\nan excellent replacement for potatoes.  Rice\nalso serves as the base for vegetarian dishes.\nUsed as the foundation for stir-fry dishes,\nit offers the perfect opportunity to make a\ngrain the centerpiece of a meal, instead of\nhaving the usual—and less healthful—focus\non meat, poultry, or seafood.  Rice flour\ncan be used to thicken sauces.\nA note about prepared rice mixes:\nalthough popular, they’re often more expen-\nsive than plain rice and typically contain a\nsignificant amount of sodium.  Rice is easy\nto cook on its own.  Try adding your\nfavorite herbs and seasonings; you can\nchoose how much (if any) salt you use.  It\nwill likely taste just as good as or better than\nthe boxed rice dishes, and it will almost\nalways be healthier.\nGrains\n279\nmay be used whole, cracked, or rolled like\noats, but they are generally ground into flour.\nRye flour comes in several different\nvarieties.  Light rye flour has most of the\nbran removed.  Dark rye flour retains most\nof the bran and germ and is a source of\nmagnesium, trace minerals, folic acid,\nthiamin, and niacin. \nDark rye flour is traditionally used to\nmake the dark, strongly flavored German\nbread called pumpernickel.  Rye also is used\nin many alcoholic beverages, including\nwhiskey and some types of vodka.\nRye\nRye belongs to the same botanical family as\nwheat and barley.  The plant is indigenous\nto Europe and Asia.  The plant itself is often\nbushy at the base and stands 5 to 8 feet high.\nRye grows well in areas where the soil is too\npoor and the climate too cool for wheat.\nRye grains have the same elongated\nshape as wheat grains.  The color ranges\nfrom buff to gray.  The husks are removed\nduring milling, but usually much of the\ngerm and bran remain, which enhances the\nnutritional value of rye products.  The grains\nVarieties of rice (clockwise\nfrom the top):  jasmine,\nbasmati, arborio, white,\nand brown (center).\n280\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nwork for almost all baked goods and pasta.\nWheat also is used in the manufacture of\nbeer and whiskey.\nThe three major types of wheat are:\nHard—Hard wheat is high in protein\n(10 to 14 percent).  It is also high in gluten\ncontent, which gives the flour elasticity and\nmakes it particularly suitable for yeast\nbreads. \nSoft—The low-protein (6 to 10 percent)\nflour is lower in gluten.  It’s often used to\nmake “softer” baked goods, such as cakes. \nDurum—This is the hardest wheat\ngrown and is highest in gluten.  Despite\nthat, it is not used in baked goods.  Instead,\nit is used to make semolina (see sidebar:\nWhat Is Semolina? page 287), the main\ningredient of pasta.\nWheat\nWheat is among the oldest of grain crops.\nMajor wheat-producing areas include the\nUnited States, whose Great Plains are con-\nsidered the “breadbasket of the world,”\nCanada, China, western Europe, Ukraine,\nKazakhstan, Russia, India, Pakistan, and\nAustralia.\nWheat is an annual plant that grows\nbetween 2 and 4 feet high, depending on\nthe variety of wheat grown and growing\nconditions.  The grains are contained in a\nbearded spike developed by the plant.\nUnlike many other grains, it can be difficult\nto cultivate.  Nevertheless, it is easily one\nof the most common grains grown around\nthe world.  Only rice rivals it in production.\nMost of the wheat grown in the world\nis eaten by humans—often in the form of\nbread.  Wheat’s high gluten content makes\nit particularly well adapted for this use.\nBecause of this, wheat flour is the frame-\nLike most grain products, rye should be\nstored in airtight containers to retard spoilage.\nPreparation Tips\nWhole rye grains are often cooked in the\nsame way as rice, that is, simmered in water\nuntil they are tender.  However, rye grains\nshould be pre-soaked in water several hours\nto speed up cooking.  Rye flour has little\ngluten, and therefore breads in which it is\nthe main flour are denser because they do\nnot rise as well.  However, rye contains\nseveral long-chained 5-carbon sugars (pen-\ntosans), which have a high water-binding\ncapacity.  This trait helps rye bread retain\nmoisture better than wheat bread. \nServing Suggestions \nUse dark rye flour to make your own\npumpernickel bread.  Also, substitute dark\nrye flour in place of some of the other flour\nin baked goods to add a nutty flavor. \nTraditional methods for growing\nrice include the manual tasks of\nsowing the seeds, transplanting,\nand harvesting by hand.\nTHE RYE AND ERGOT\nCONNECTION\nThe poor soil and moist climate in\nwhich rye grows are also favorable\nconditions for the growth of a\nfungus called ergot, which can grow\non moisture-laden rye kernels.\nErgot has long been known to have\nmedicinal properties, and today it is\nused in medications given during\nchildbirth to promote contractions\nof the uterus and control bleeding.\nIt also is used in some migraine\nheadache medications.  Ingesting too\nmuch of it, however, may lead to\nhallucinogenic effects.  A derivative\nof ergot is lysergic acid diethylamide\n(LSD).  Modern milling processes\nclean rye grains and remove any that\nmay be contaminated with ergot. \nWheat also is classified according to\nthe time of year it is planted.  Spring wheat,\nas its name suggests, is sown in the spring.\nWinter wheat is grown in areas with more\nmoderate winters and is sown in the late\nfall.\nLiterally thousands of products are\nmade from wheat—flour, bread, and pasta\nare just the fundamental items.  Whole-\nwheat products, however, are the most\nnutritious because they have not been\nmilled as extensively as more refined\nproducts.  Whole-wheat products include\nthe following:\nCracked wheat—As the name implies,\nthis is wheat seed that has been broken into\nsmall pieces.  It can be finely or coarsely\ncracked.\nBulgur—A popular ingredient in many\nMiddle East dishes, bulgur is a type of\ncracked wheat that has been steam-cooked\nand dried.  Because of this, it does not\nrequire as much cooking time as other\nwhole-wheat products.  Bulgur is used for\nmaking tabbouleh (a well-known Middle\nEast cuisine favorite), cereal, and pilaf.  It\nis available in a variety of grinds, from fine\nto coarse.\nGrains\n281\nis added to bread for extra crunch and\nnutrition.  Wheat flakes make excellent addi-\ntions to hot cereals or baked goods.  Wheat\ngroats have a strong, nut-like flavor.  They\nare used in bread doughs or soups or are\nserved on their own as a pilaf, for example.\nWheat groats also can be eaten sprouted. \nFarina—A breakfast favorite, farina is\nperhaps better known as Cream of Wheat.\nIt is made from the endosperm of the wheat\nseed, which is then milled very finely.\nFarina can be used in dumplings, main\ndishes, or desserts, particularly in Indian\nand Greek cuisine.\nWheat flakes—Also known as rolled\nwheat, these are wheat seeds that have been\nflattened.  They look like rolled oats,\nalthough they are slightly larger and thicker.\nAlthough it might be easy to picture these\nas the main component of many cold break-\nfast cereals, wheat flakes are not the product\nused in these cereals.\nGroats or wheat berries—These are\nother names for wheat seeds sold whole.\nBecause they have undergone very little\nmilling, these are among the most nutri-\ntious of wheat products.\nPreparation Tips \nIf buying whole-wheat kernels in bulk, wash\nthe product before use to remove debris.\nThose that are packaged typically do not\nneed to be rinsed.\nThe various forms of whole wheat that\nare used in hot cereals or served as side\ndishes are generally cooked by adding water\nto them and simmering until the water is\ngone.  Cooking time varies, although a\ngeneral rule is that cracked wheat requires\nless cooking time than whole wheat.  Most\nwhole-wheat products have cooking\ninstructions on their labels.  Because the\nwheat germ contains fat, whole-wheat grain\nand products made from it should be refrig-\nerated to prevent spoiling.\nServing Suggestions\nWhole-wheat products can be served on\ntheir own as a hot cereal or pilaf.  They also\ncan be added to other dishes for extra nutri-\ntion and taste.  Cracked wheat, for example,\nANATOMY OF A WHEAT SEED\nThe wheat seed, sometimes referred\nto as a wheat berry, is comprised of\nthree parts:\nWheat germ—This is the sprout,\nor embryo, found inside the wheat\nseed.  It is oily and is a highly con-\ncentrated source of nutrients.\nProducts made from wheat germ \n(an excellent source of vitamin E)\ninclude wheat germ oil and toasted\nwheat germ.\nWheat bran—The wheat bran is\nthe tough outer covering of the\nwheat seed.  The bran is typically\nremoved during milling.  This\nprocessing is unfortunate because\nthe bran is an excellent source of\ninsoluble fiber.  Cooks often use it to\nadd taste and nutrition to meat loaf,\ncasseroles, and baked goods. \nEndosperm—The endosperm\nconstitutes the majority of the material\nwithin the wheat seed and is meant\nto nourish a seedling.  Most of the\nprotein and carbohydrates and small\namounts of vitamins are in the\nendosperm.  It is composed mainly\nof starch and is the main ingredient\nin wheat flour and other wheat\nproducts. \nWHAT IS TRITICALE?\nTriticale is a 20th-century hybrid\nthat is a cross between wheat and\nrye.  It combines the nutritional\nbenefits of both: the high protein\ncontent of wheat and the high lysine\ncontent of rye.  Several varieties are\nunder cultivation.  Researchers are\nstudying ways to improve the yield\nand adaptability of this unique crop. \nWild Rice\nNot really a rice, although closely related\nto it genetically, wild rice is actually an\naquatic grain.  It is the seed of a marsh grass\nthat grows in the northern Great Lakes area\nof the United States.  It is known for its\nhazelnut-like flavor, dark-brown color, and\nchewy texture.  American Indians, who\nonce waged wars over areas where wild rice\ngrew abundantly, have harvested it for\ncenturies.  These indigenous peoples called\nwild rice “mahnomen,” meaning “precious\ngift from the gods.”\nFirst domesticated successfully in the\n1950s after many attempts to mimic the\nmoist, murky conditions where the wild\nrice-producing grass grows best, wild rice\nis now grown commercially in the Upper\nMidwest and in California.  The crop is\nnow worth more than $20 million annually.\nMost wild rice is eaten whole, but it also\ncan be ground into flour.\n282\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nGrain Products\nBread\nBread is such a fundamental food that the\nword “bread” itself is often equivalent to\n“food” or “money” in many parts of the\nworld.  Although it is a simple food, bread\nrequires the conversion of grain into flour,\nleavening ingredients, and a means of\nbaking.  Bread also plays a role in many\ncustomary rituals, such as the breaking and\nblessing of bread in religious rites. \nAlthough there are hundreds of differ-\nent types of bread, the main types are\nleavened (meaning raised) and unleavened\nbreads.  There are also quick breads, in\nwhich baking powder or baking soda is used\nas a leavening agent.\nThe main ingredients in most breads\nare the following:\nFlour—The powdery material from\nground grain, flour is the main ingredient\nin bread.  Because of its high gluten content,\nwheat flour lends itself best to bread\nmaking.  The gluten, when mixed with\nwater, gives the bread dough elasticity.  This\nallows the dough to expand when the yeast\nferments, yet it is strong enough to contain\nit.  The result is light and airy bread.  Any\ngrain can be used to make bread.  In coun-\ntries where wheat is less readily available,\ngrains that are used include millet, barley,\nrye, and oats. \nLiquid—Water is the most common\nliquid in bread making, but beer, milk, and\nfruit juice also can be used.  Liquid is\nneeded in raised bread to allow the gluten\nin flour to do its work.  The type of liquid\nused can result in the bread having different\nproperties.  Water, for example, will result\nin a thick crust.\nYeast—Yeast is a one-celled organism\nthat is used to leaven bread.  Unleavened\nbreads and quick breads do not contain\nPreparation Tips\nWash wild rice before cooking.  The basic\npreparation recipe for wild rice is to place\n1 cup of wild rice in a saucepan with 4 cups\nof water (chicken or beef stock can be\nadded for flavor).  Bring the mixture to a\nboil and then reduce the heat.  Simmer the\nrice covered for 40 to 50 minutes until it\nis tender and most of the grains have split\nevenly.\nServing Suggestions\nWild rice is mixed into a multitude of\ndishes, from everyday cooking to gourmet\ncreations.  Use cooked wild rice in place of\npasta products in casseroles or salads.  It\ncan be used in place of bulgur in tabbouleh\nsalads or as the base for stir-fry dishes\ninstead of white rice.  Mixed with vegetables\nor small amounts of meat, poultry, or fish,\nwild rice provides the base for an excellent\nentrée.\nyeast.  When yeast ferments the substances\nnaturally present in flour, it produces a gas\ncalled carbon dioxide.  Bread rises as the\ngluten in the dough traps this gas.  Yeast is\nalso responsible for bread’s delicious aroma\nand gives it its flavor.\nSalt—Bread can be made without this\nstaple, but salt does several things when it\nis added to dough.  It adds flavor, helps\nstrengthen the gluten, and helps regulate\nyeast production.\nOptional ingredients—Two ingredients\nthat do not have to be added to bread but\noften are include sugar and fat.  Sugar pro-\nvides a ready food source for the multiply-\ning yeast, adds flavor to bread, and helps it\nstay moist.  Fat is often used in commercial\nbread making.  It adds flavor and tender-\nness. In addition, it gives the dough more\nelastic qualities, allowing it to expand more.\nThe most common type of bread eaten\nin the United States is made from refined\nwhite flour.  Although enriched during\nprocessing and baking, not all of the\nnutrients lost when the flour is refined are\nreturned to it.  A more nutritious choice is\nwhole-wheat bread.  Whole-wheat bread is\nmade from flour ground from whole-wheat\ngrains—meaning the bran and the germ\nalso are used.  Make sure the label indicates\nthat only whole-wheat flour was used.\nOtherwise, whole wheat or cracked wheat\nmay have been added to white flour. \nCommon types of breads are as follows:\nBagels—Once only an ethnic delicacy,\nbagels have gone mainstream and are now\nenjoyed by just about everyone as a break-\nfast main course, the foundation for a sand-\nwich, or a nutritious snack.  These donut-\nshaped rolls are made from flour, yeast,\nand salt.  Tradition calls for them to be\nboiled before they’re baked—a process that\ngives them a characteristic shiny appearance\nGrains\n283\nFlat breads—Named for their shape,\nflat breads are rolled out and allowed to rise\nonly minimally.  They are baked only until\nthey are soft.  Pita bread (sometimes referred\nto as pocket bread) is a common type of\nflat bread.  Other types include crackers\nand tortillas, which are commonly made\nfrom corn.  \nand chewy texture.  Bagels can be flavored\nin many ways, although favorites include\nonions or raisins.  A word of caution:  gen-\nerally a nutritious food choice, bagels can\nbe high in calories depending on their size,\ningredients, and choice of topping.  Check\nthe label or ask the deli for nutrition infor-\nmation so you know what you are getting.\n284\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nFrench bread—Sometimes referred to\nas baguettes because of the traditional elon-\ngated shape of the loaf, French bread has a\nthick, shiny crust and a chewy texture.\nCoating the dough with egg whites before\nbaking gives the crust its characteristic prop-\nerties.  The bread is traditionally made with-\nout preservatives.\nPumpernickel—Rye flour gives this\nbread its hearty flavor and its dense, chewy\ntexture.  Rye flour does not contain as much\ngluten as wheat flour and, therefore, the\nbread does not rise as much as bread made\nwith wheat flour.  Caramel or molasses gives\nit its dark color.\nRye bread—Rye bread also is made\nwith rye flour, but the flour is usually mixed\nwith wheat flour during preparation.  Look\nat labels to determine how much rye flour\na bread contains.  As little as 3 percent is\nall that is needed to call it rye bread.\nSourdough—Bread aficionados know\nthis bread for its characteristic tangy taste\nand smell.  The leavening for sourdough\nbreads is a type of bacterium, such as\nLactobacilli, that produces carbon dioxide\n(to leaven the bread) and lactic acid (for a\nsour taste).  Sometimes both bacteria and\nyeast are in the bread starter, in which case\ntwo types of fermentation occur.  This is\nthe type of starter used for San Francisco\nsourdough breads.\nAlways buy the freshest bread possible.\nLook at expiration dates on packages, and\ncheck to ensure there is no mold growth\non the bread.  Check labels to find out how\nmuch fat or salt has been added.  If pur-\nchasing whole-grain or so-called multi-grain\nbread, check labels to find out how much\nGrains\n285\nwhole-grain flour has been used.  Often, it\nis mixed with more refined types of flour.\nPreparation Tips\nExperimenting with different flours is an\nexcellent idea, allowing you to add both\ntaste and nutrition to regular recipes.  Keep\nin mind the gluten content of the flour you\nare working with, however.  Otherwise, the\nresult may not be as desired.  It may take a\nfew tries to find out how much rye flour,\nor wheat bran, you should add.  Loaves of\nbread should be stored wrapped to keep\nthem from drying out.  Sliced bread will\nkeep for up to a week at room temperature\nand for about 2 months in the freezer. \nA quick note about nutrition: toasting\nbread can reduce the amount of some key\nnutrients by as much as 20 percent.\nServing Suggestions\nBread can be used as slices, cubes, or crumbs.\nHollowed-out loaves of bread make simple,\nedible containers for soups or dips.  Bread\ncut into small pieces was the most common\nthickening agent in early European cooking,\nparticularly poultry stuffing.  Bread crumbs\nare often used to add body to foods, such as\nsteamed pudding, sausages, and meat loaf.\nBread croutons, or “little crusts,” are added\nto soups and salads for texture and taste.\nTry using different breads—such as pita\nbreads—to give sandwiches a different twist. \nCereals\nAlthough cereal has traditionally been a\nsynonym for grain, most people think of it\ntoday as the food that comes packaged in a\nbright box and is poured into a bowl of\nmilk in the morning for breakfast.\nHundreds of cereals are available in just\nabout any American supermarket today.\nDr. John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of a\nflattened, toasted wheat flake in the late\n1800s, would probably be surprised at the\nenthusiasm for his invention and the deriv-\natives of it. \nFor several decades after Kellogg’s wheat\nflake was introduced (followed closely by\ncorn flakes and shredded wheat), marketers\ntouted the cereals as the key to both health\nand vitality.  Today, corn, wheat, oats, and\neven some lesser-known grains such as\namaranth and quinoa are puffed, popped,\nbaked, shredded, or processed into “Os,”\nletters of the alphabet, and even in the shape\nof popular cartoon characters.\nUnfortunately, cereal’s reputation as a\nhealthful food has suffered.  Many cereals are\na wise breakfast choice, but too many of them\n(particularly children’s cereals) also have sugar\nand artificial flavorings and colors added to\nthem.  Granola-based cereals and many that\npurport to be rich in oat bran or fiber also\nmay be high in fat.  Checking the labels to\nsee what you are getting is always a good idea.\nOne ingredient to look for in particular is\nhydrogenated fat, which contains a type of\nfat called trans fatty acids.  Trans fatty acids\nhave been linked to an increased risk of car-\ndiovascular disease. \nPreparation Tips\nConsider the nutrition of the other main\ningredient in a bowl of cereal: milk.  The\ntype you choose can have a major effect on\nthe nutrition of a meal based on a bowl of\ncereal.  Choose skim milk.  Skim milk\nreduces calories and saturated fat signifi-\ncantly yet provides the same nutrients as\nwhole milk.\nWhole grains for hot cereal can be\npurchased at specialty stores and in the\nnatural food aisle of many supermarkets.\nFollow label instructions for cooking. \nPALMITATE IN CEREALS\nMany people, particularly those who are watching fat intake closely, wonder\nwhether palmitate, a common ingredient in cereals, is the same as palm oil.  Palm\noil is high in saturated fat—the type of fat linked most closely with cardiovascular\ndisease.  Palmitate is a form of palmitic acid, one of the saturated fatty acids found\nin palm oil.  Vegetable fats, such as soybean oil, also \ncontain palmitic acid.  However, cereal\nmanufacturers add a very small amount\nof palmitate to stabilize vitamin A\nand maintain the nutrient's\npotency.  You will often see the\ningredient listed as “vitamin A\npalmitate.”  There is no need to\nworry about the tiny amounts \nof palmitate added to cereals.\nServing Suggestions\nTry adding cold cereal to reduced-fat or\nnonfat yogurt for a crunchy, creamy treat.\nOr, top off cold cereal with sliced fruit of\nyour own choosing.  Fruit added to cereals\nby manufacturers is often high in sodium\nand sugar, and usually there is not a lot of\nit in the box.  Add nutrition to a bowl of\nhot or cold cereal by sprinkling wheat bran\nor germ over it. \nFlour\nFlour is the powdery substance made from\ngrinding grains.  Flour has been used by\nnearly every culture in the world for making\nfoods—usually breads—that are staples in\nthe diet.  Wheat is usually used, but flour\n286\nPart II     Encyclopedia of Foods\nThe characteristics of flour depend on\nthe type of material used to make it.  Because\nmost flour is used to make bread and other\nbaked goods, most flour is ground from\nwheat.  The high gluten content of wheat\nworks well in leavened bread, leading to a\nlight and airy finished product.  Most wheat\nflour contains a combination of flour from\nhard and soft wheat. Hard wheats contain\nmore protein and gluten, and soft wheat\nflours make for a more delicate texture. \nTypes of flour include the following:\nAll-purpose flour—This is what is typ-\nically on the shelf at the supermarket.  A\nblend of hard and soft wheat flour, all-pur-\npose flour has a wide range of uses and\nworks well in breads or pastries.  Look at\ncan be ground from almost any grain and\nsometimes is ground from potatoes,\npeanuts, chickpeas, lentils, and edible roots\nof plants.\nFlour was traditionally ground by hand\nor by stone, but today’s flour undergoes an\nextensive process in which grain seeds are\npulverized by steel rollers.  More refined flour\nhas the bran and the germ—and thus, the\nnutrition—removed from the seed.  Flour\nis mostly composed of the seed’s starchy\nendosperm.  However, the germ and bran\nare returned to the flour at the end of the\nmilling process in whole-grain flours.  For\nother types of flour, nutrients are returned\nat the end of the process, although not all\nof them are returned.  Check the label to see\nwhether the flour has been enriched. \nImagine what it would be like if eating pizza, pasta, most\nbreads, cookies, cakes, candy bars, canned soup, or luncheon\nmeats or drinking a beer left you with cramps, diarrhea,\nanemia, and even osteoporosis.  For many people with celiac\ndisease, that is a reality.\nCeliac disease, also called celiac sprue, is a hereditary\ndisease that occurs when a protein called gluten found in\nwheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats generates an immune\nreaction in the small intestine of genetically susceptible\npeople.  As a result, tiny hair-like projections in the small\nintestine, called villi, shrink and sometimes disappear.  The\nvilli then are not able to absorb nutrients from food, and the\nresult is abnormally colored, foul-smelling stools and weight\nloss.  This malabsorption also can deprive the brain, nervous\nsystem, bones, liver, and other organs of nourishment and\ncause vitamin and mineral deficiencies that may lead to \nother medical problems.\nAbout 1 in 500 people in the United States has celiac\ndisease—about 500,000 Americans.  Some speculate that\nceliac disease has affected humans since they first switched\nfrom a foraging diet of meat and nuts to a cultivated diet that\nincluded high-protein grasses such as wheat.  Physicians have\ngained an understanding of the disease and how to treat it in\nonly the past 50 years.  Today, people with celiac disease are\nable to lead nearly normal, healthy lives.\nA gluten-free diet—a lifelong and complete avoidance of\nwheat, rye, barley, and oats and any foods that contain them—\nis the only way to treat this disease.  Following such a diet is\nnot as easy as it seems because many processed foods and\nmedications contain gluten. \nOnce gluten is removed from the diet, the digestive tract\nbegins healing within several days.  Significant healing and\nregrowth of the villi may take several months in young\npeople and as long as 2 to 3 years in older persons.\nFoods allowed in a gluten-free diet include fresh meats,\nfish, poultry, milk and unprocessed cheeses, dried beans,\nplain fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, and gluten-free\ngrains such as corn and rice.\nIdentifying gluten-free foods can be difficult.  People with\nceliac disease should discuss their food selections with their\nphysician and a registered dietitian.  A dietitian also can\nadvise how best to improve the nutritional quality of a diet.\nFood manufacturers can be contacted to find out whether a\nproduct contains gluten.  Celiac disease support groups and\nInternet sites also may have information on the ingredients\nfound in food products. \nCELIAC DISEASE\nthe label to see whether the flour has been\nbleached.  Manufacturers often bleach it to\nwhiten it.  One result is that the flour may\nhave more gluten.  Unbleached flours, how-\never, may have more flavor.\nBread flour—A specialty flour used for\nbread making, this flour has a higher gluten\ncontent.\nCake flour—Made exclusively of soft\nwheat, this very refined flour gives cakes a\nlight, soft texture.  Because it is so refined,\nit has a low gluten content and cannot be\nused to make raised breads.  Pastry flour is\na less refined version of cake flour.\nDurum flour—Made from hard wheat,\ndurum flour is often used in pasta because\nit is high in gluten.\nGluten flour—This flour undergoes a\nmanufacturing process so that its gluten\nhas about twice the strength of regular flour.\nIt is useful for adding to recipes to balance\nflours that are low in gluten.\nSelf-rising flour—This flour contains\nsalt and a leavening agent, such as baking\nsoda.  It should not be used in yeast breads.\nIn addition, leavening agents in this flour\ncan lose strength with age.\nWhole-wheat or whole-grain flour—\nThis is flour that has the wheat germ and\nbran (or the bran and germ from the grain\nbeing used) that were removed during\nmilling added back before it is packaged\nfor consumers.  Sometimes this is called\ngraham flour.  This type of flour is higher\nin nutrients.\nPreparation Tips\nProper storage of flour is essential because\nflour can spoil—sometimes quickly under\nthe right conditions.  The result is an objec-\ntionable odor and inferior baked products.\nHow to store flour depends on the type\nbeing used.  It is best to store whole-grain\nflours in airtight containers in the freezer.\nGrains\n287\nonly semolina, which does not absorb as\nmuch water and is pleasantly firm when\ncooked al dente (slightly firm).\nPasta also may include other ingredi-\nents.  Some doughs have a little egg added.\nOther ingredients may include soybean and\nmung bean flour, vegetables (spinach, toma-\ntoes, beets, carrots), gluten, whey, herbs,\nspices, and flavorings.  Color can be pro-\nvided by vegetable purées or food coloring. \nPasta comes in literally hundreds of\nshapes, sizes, thicknesses, and colors.  The\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA), however, groups it all into two main\ncategories:\nMacaroni—This includes just about\nevery pasta shape and size.  The FDA requires\nthat macaroni be made from durum wheat\nflour or semolina.  Ingredients such as salt,\neggs, and flavorings also may be added. \nNoodles—Noodles are generally made\nwith softer durum wheat flours than\nsemolina and contain egg.  In addition, the\namount of egg they can contain is limited\nto 5 1/2 percent of weight or less. \nThe shape and choice of the pasta you\nchoose depend on what you like and how\nit will be served.  A general rule is that\nthinner pastas are best in soups and stews.\nWhole-grain flours will stay fresh for up to\na year this way.  Whole-grain flours include\nthe germ of the grain, which contains\npolyunsaturated fat.  This fat is susceptible\nto oxidation and rancidity the longer it is\nexposed to air. \nRefined flours have only the starchy\nendosperm of the grain.  Such flours can be\nstored at room temperature up to a year or\nin the freezer for up to 2 years.  Airtight con-\ntainers will keep refined flours tasting fresh.\nBecause flour can spoil, it may be wise\nto purchase flours in small quantities so\nyou use them up more quickly.\nServing Suggestions\nFlour is the basis for most baked goods.\nAlthough wheat flour is typically used, other\ntypes of flour can be used to boost flavor and\nnutrition.  Flour also typically is used as a\nthickening agent in soups, stews, and creams.\nPasta\nThe origins of this popular and versatile\nfood are lost in the mists of history; several\ncountries (China, Japan, and Italy, just to\nname a few) claim credit for pasta.  Nearly\nevery country, however, has some pasta\nvariation to claim as its own. \nThe term “pasta” is used broadly and\ngenerically to describe a wide variety of\nnoodles made from dough.  The word\n“pasta” itself is thought to be derived from\nthe Italian word for paste. \nThe main ingredients in pasta dough\nare flour—which is usually made from\ndurum wheat and is called semolina—and\na liquid.  The dough is rolled out, cut or\npressed into the desired shape, and readied\nfor sale.  Pasta is sold fresh, frozen, or dried.\nImported dried pasta is considered superi-\nor to American-made products, mainly\nbecause the imported pasta is made with\nWHAT IS SEMOLINA?\nSemolina is a yellow, granular flour\nthat is ground from durum wheat.\nThe word is derived from the Latin\n“simila,” which means fine white\nflour.  Semolina is made from the\nendosperm of the durum wheat \nseed. It has a high protein content.\nAlthough it can be used in a variety\nof baked goods, semolina mainly is\nused to make pasta. \n288\nPart II     Encyclopedia of Foods\nPASTA COOKING TIMES\nType\nDried\nFresh\nPasta\n(in minutes)\n(in minutes)\nCannelloni\n8\n1/2-2\nShells\n10\n3\nFarfalle (bowties)\n7-10\n2-3\nFettuccine\n8-9\n1 1/2-3\nLasagna\n10\n2-4\nLinguine\n5-7\n1 1/2-2\nMacaroni\n9-10\nNot available\nRavioli\nNot available\n7-9\nSpaghetti\n7-9\n2-3\nTortellini\n9-11\n7-9\nPasta that is curved or tubular is thought\nto soak up creams and sauces better. \nThe color and crispness of dried pasta\ndetermine quality.  White pasta should be\nslightly golden and translucent, not grayish\nor cloudy.  Spaghetti should have the\nspringiness of fresh twigs.  A good-quality\nflat noodle will fracture in a jagged line\nwhen broken and not look starchy.  Check\nfresh pasta for expiration dates.\nDried pasta should be stored airtight\nin a cool, dry place and can be kept almost\nindefinitely.  Fresh pasta should have a\npleasant aroma.  It is highly perishable and\nwill keep for several days in the refrigerator\nand for up to a month in the freezer.\nCooked pasta will keep in the refrigerator\nfor up to 5 days.\nPreparation Tips\nPasta is cooked by adding it to boiling water.\nIf desired, add a pinch of salt for flavor and\na small amount of oil to the water.  The oil\nwill help prevent the pasta from becoming\nsticky.  Then, cook the pasta until it is done.\nDoneness is mostly a matter of taste—how\nfirm or soft do you like it?  Many cooks use\nthe term “al dente” in reference to pasta\ndoneness.  Al dente simply means cooking\nthe pasta until it is firm to the bite. \nCooking time varies, however, depend-\ning on whether the pasta is fresh or dried.\nIt also depends on whether the pasta is\nmade from soft or hard flour.  Generally,\npasta made from hard wheat flour is cooked\nlonger than pasta made from soft wheat\nflour.  Fresh pasta cooks much faster than\ndried pasta. \nGrains\n289\nAsian noodles come in varying lengths\nand widths.  Chinese wheat noodles are\nusually made from wheat, water, and salt,\nand eggs are sometimes added.  In Japan,\nwheat noodles are classified by size:  thin\nnoodles are called somen, and thick noodles\nare called udon.  Other types of noodles\nare the following:\nBuckwheat noodles—Called soba by\nthe Japanese, these noodles can be pur-\nchased fresh or dried. \nMung bean noodles—These noodles\nare transparent and sometimes referred to\nas cellophane noodles.  They are added to\nvarious dishes, including many soups.\nRice noodles—Made from rice flour\nand water, rice noodles vary widely in size\nand texture. \nPreparation Tips\nNoodles should be soft and look fresh.  Your\nbest bet for fresh noodles is to buy them\nfrom an Asian specialty food store.\nCooking methods vary, as do cooking\ntimes.  Most noodles, however, are cooked\ninitially by adding them to boiling water.\nSome noodles may need to be soaked before\ncooking.  Follow package instructions.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough fried Asian noodles are added to\nvarious dishes, healthier alternatives include\nserving chilled buckwheat noodles with\nlow-sodium soy sauce or adding various\nAsian noodles to soups and stews.  Asian\nnoodles can also be added to stir-fry dishes\nor mixed in salads with cooked vegetables\nand strips of cooked chicken or beef.\nIf desired, rinse pasta with cold water\nafter removing it from heat.  Some pastas\nused in baked dishes—such as lasagna,\nmanicotti, and cannelloni—do not require\nprecooking, but they usually require a\ngreater amount of sauce, which is absorbed\nby the pasta as it cooks.  Pasta that is cooked\nfor a long time loses slightly more of its\nwater-soluble B vitamins than pasta cooked\nal dente. \nServing Suggestions\nPasta itself is low in calories and fat, but\nsauces that are heavy and fatty, as well as other\nadditions, can negate pasta’s nutritional\nadvantages.  Fortunately, healthy options\nabound.  Supermarkets offer a wide variety\nof reduced-fat pasta sauces or those that are\nvegetable- and herb-based.  Tomato-based\nsauces are also easy—and quick—to make\nfrom scratch.  Simply use several cans of\nwhole, peeled tomatoes, crush them, and\nthen simmer them in a skillet until they\nturn “saucy.”  Add desired seasonings (garlic,\npepper, and salt work well) and a small\namount of olive oil to the cooking mixture.\nTop with reduced-fat cheeses.  Pasta is also\nexcellent served cold when tossed with a\nlittle oil, vinegar, garlic, and fresh herbs. \nAsian Noodles\nNoodles have been part of Asian cuisine for\ncenturies and continue to play a central role\nin many well-loved dishes.  They are served\nin ways most Westerners are familiar with:\neither chilled or hot, covered with a sauce\nor dressing, or added to soups or stews.\n291\nNutritionists have long recognized that\nAmericans generally eat too many animal-\nbased proteins.  That’s one of the reasons the\n“meat group” makes up just a small segment\nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s\n(USDA) Food Guide Pyramid.  It’s also why\nthe Food Guide Pyramid no longer refers to\nproteins as “meat” alone. \nAlthough most people associate protein\nwith only meat, there are many other ways\nto add this critical nutrient to the diet.  This\nchapter covers the traditional animal sources\nof protein in the diet.  It also introduces\nyou to alternative plant-based sources and\nprovides tips on incorporating a variety of\nthese foods into a healthful diet.\nBecause of the wide variety of high-pro-\ntein foods, this chapter has been organized\ninto the following sections to make it easier\nto learn about them: \nC\nompared with other populations, Americans have always found plentiful sources of proteins\nfrom both animal and plant sources.  Ever since the 1800s, fueled by a growing American\ncattle industry and refrigerated railroad cars, meat has been viewed as the key component to a\nmeal.  If you doubt that statement, think of the last time you were asked, “What’s for dinner?”\nEven if the menu included a balanced meal of green salad, glazed carrots, brown rice, and a small\nlean steak,  many people would respond, “We’re having steak.”\nSo important is the idea of meat — or protein of any kind — that it’s considered a meal in\nand of itself. \nProtein is an important nutrient in the diet.  That’s undisputed.  The trouble is that most\nAmericans consume too much of it, particularly animal-based proteins, which are high in\nsaturated fat and cholesterol, both of which are linked to cardiovascular disease.\nMost people need just 5 to 6 ounces a day of high-protein foods.  \nThat may sound like a lot, but it isn’t.  A 2- to 3-ounce serving \nof meat is about the size of a deck of cards.  Now think of the \ngiant portions of meat and other high-protein foods often served \nat restaurants.  Eating two to three times as much protein as you \nneed in a day can easily be accomplished in just one restaurant meal. \n• Poultry\n• Shellfish\n• Eggs\n• Legumes\n• Meat\n• Nuts and Seeds\n• Fish\nPoultry\nWhen nomadic hunters and gatherers first\nbecame farmers, they realized the impor-\ntance of raising birds.  The egg could be\neaten, the feathers were used for bedding\nand clothing, and the flesh made a fine\nroast.  It also was economical to keep\npoultry; cattle needed miles of grazing land,\nbut a chicken could peck around a yard and\nkeep itself fed.  Until mass production tech-\nniques, poultry meat was fairly expensive;\nnew technology has made poultry more\naffordable through breeding and produc-\ntion techniques.\nToday, poultry is defined as any domes-\ntic bird used as food.  There are many\ndomesticated varieties of poultry, includ-\ning chicken, turkey, duck, goose, Rock\nCornish hen, guinea fowl, and pheasant.\nGenerally, all types of birds are sold fresh,\nfrozen, or cooked.  They can be purchased\nwhole, halved, or in pieces, such as boneless\nbreasts, strips, or medallions.  Buying a\nwhole bird is typically least expensive\nbecause additional processing adds cost. \nPoultry is a versatile addition to any\nmeal and can be prepared with just about\nany cooking method.  A recommended\nserving, no matter how it is prepared, is still\nabout 2 to 3 ounces ready to eat, without\nbone or skin. \nHigh-Protein Foods \nIncludes: Poultry, Eggs, Meat, Fish, Shellfish, Legumes, Nuts & Seeds\n292\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nor more, after handling raw poultry.  In\naddition, disinfect any surface or utensil\nthat came in contact with the raw bird. \nThorough cooking destroys any disease-\ncausing organisms (pathogens) in meat.\nUse a meat thermometer and cook poultry\nuntil the internal temperature reaches 180°\nFahrenheit.  The center of the chicken\nshould be white with no sign of pink. \nThe following pages provide an overview\nof the main types of poultry: chicken, duck,\ngame birds, goose, and turkey.\nChicken\nThanks in large part to chicken’s low price,\nlow fat, and high versatility, the amount of\nchicken consumed in the United States has\nincreased exponentially.\nThat wasn’t always the case.  Even\nthough chicken is one of the oldest living\nspecies of animal, it was a rarity on the\ndinner table.  King Henri IV of France\nstated in his coronation speech that he\nhoped each peasant in his realm would have\n“a chicken in his pot every Sunday.”  At one\ntime, only the rich (and chicken farmers)\ncould manage the proverbial Sunday\nchicken.  Today, thanks to modern pro-\nduction methods, almost anyone can afford\nchicken.  In fact, adjusted for inflation,\nchicken is only a third the price it was 40\nyears ago.\nChicken consumption also has\nincreased because of increasing awareness\nof the need to reduce fat in the diet.\nChicken, as long as the skin is not eaten, is\ngenerally lower in fat than most other types\nof meat.  At least half of the fat in a chick-\nen is in the skin.\nThe government grades chicken quality\nwith USDA classifications A, B, and C,\nwhich are based on meatiness, appearance,\nand how intact the skin and bones are.\nStorage\nAlways keep poultry refrigerated at 40°\nFahrenheit.  Poultry can be stored in its\noriginal wrapping.  If freezing, over-wrap\nwith airtight foil or freezer bags to prevent\nfreezer burn.  Frozen poultry can be stored\nfor up to 12 months if it is purchased whole\nand 6 to 9 months if it is purchased as\npoultry parts.  Frozen poultry should always\nbe defrosted in the refrigerator and cooked\nin less than 24 hours after thawing.\nRefrigerated poultry should be cooked within\n2 to 3 days.\nSafety Issues\nPoultry is a particular concern when it\ncomes to food-borne disease.  The gas-\ntrointestinal systems of poultry frequently\nharbor harmful microorganisms.  Mass\nslaughtering processes offer ample oppor-\ntunity for these organisms to contaminate\nthe meat.  Outbreaks of Salmonella, a bac-\nterium that causes vomiting and diarrhea,\nare often associated with eating contami-\nnated poultry.  Another microorganism\nfound on chicken is Campylobacter, a bac-\nterium that can cause severe diar-\nrhea and stomach cramping.\nAt the store, avoid cross-\ncontamination by putting\npoultry in plastic bags to\nprevent leakage onto\nother foods.  At home,\nprevent raw poultry\nfrom coming into con-\ntact with other foods by\nusing separate cutting\nboards and utensils during\nmeal preparation.  Always\nquickly disinfect any surface or\nutensil that has come in contact\nwith any raw poultry.  In addi-\ntion, wash hands with hot water\nand soap, lathering for 20 seconds\nNutrition\nAll poultry, which is defined as any domes-\ntic bird used as food, is a nutritional star.\nClassified as a complete protein, poultry\nmeat is a good source of phosphorus and\nzinc and an excellent source of niacin.\nThe fat content of poultry depends on\nthe bird.  Goose and duck are the fattiest\ntypes of poultry.  (See the Appendix:\nDietary Reference Intakes, page 460.)\nHowever, poultry generally contains less\nfat than meat from other animals.  To elim-\ninate significant fat, do not eat the skin.\nCooking the meat with or without the skin\nmakes little difference in fat content.  The\nmeat will be more moist if the skin is left on\nduring cooking.\nSelection\nWhen buying fresh poultry, look for meat\nthat is supple and moist and has no dry or\ndiscolored patches.  Another important\ncriterion is odor.  Avoid birds that have an\nobjectionable smell.  Do not buy frozen\npoultry that is dried out or is covered with\nfrost.  A sure sign that a bird has been\nfrozen, thawed, and refrozen is the\npresence of pinkish ice on the carcass.\nGrade A chickens, the highest grade, are usu-\nally found in markets.  Grade B chickens are\nless meaty, and grade C birds are scrawnier\nyet.  B- and C-graded chickens often are\nused for processed and packaged foods.  The\ngrade stamp can be found within a shield\non the package wrapping, or sometimes on\na tag attached to the bird's wing.  Many\nungraded chickens find their way to stores\nbecause grading is not mandatory.\nChickens called “broilers” are butchered\nat about 7 weeks of age, when they weigh\nbetween 2 and 4 pounds.  The term “fryer”\nis often given to larger birds from this age\nrange.  “Roasting chickens” generally weigh\nmore than 4 pounds and are slaughtered\nwhen they reach 10 weeks.  “Stewing\nchickens” — also known as hens or boil-\ning fowl — range in age from 10 to 18\nmonths.  They can weigh between 3 and 6\npounds.  Generally, they are used for stews\nand soups because their meat is tougher.\nShoppers may also encounter other terms\nto describe chicken.  A Rock Cornish hen\n(or game hen) is a chicken hybrid that weighs\nabout 2 pounds when butchered.  Because\nthere is relatively little meat on the carcass,\neach hen is typically considered 1 serving.\nAnother type of chicken in stores is called\nfree-range chicken.  According to the USDA,\nthis term means that the chicken was allowed\nto roam outdoors.  Depending on the man-\nufacturer, the chicken may or may not have\nbeen fed a vegetarian diet free of hormones,\ngrowth enhancers, and antibiotics.  Some\nbelieve that this special treatment results in\na fuller-flavored chicken.  One thing certain\nis that it adds to the expense.  Most free-\nrange chickens are far more expensive per\npound than regular chicken.\nA tip for shoppers: larger chickens are\na better buy because there is more flesh on\nthe bones.  With smaller chickens, you do\nnot get as much meat and you pay for bones.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n293\nServing Suggestions\nChicken is extremely versatile.  Because of\nits popularity, entire cookbooks have been\nwritten focusing on only this bird.  It seems\nalmost every ethnicity has its own way to\nuse chicken — Indian curry chicken,\nChinese stir-fry, Mexican chicken enchi-\nladas, Spanish paella, and Italian chicken\nparmesan.  Chicken’s flavor is enhanced by\nalmost any herb, spice, or condiment. \nFrying is also a popular way to serve\nchicken.  However, this cooking method\nadds extra fat and calories, detracting from\nthe health benefits of eating chicken.  If\neating at a fast-food restaurant, choose\ngrilled chicken instead of chicken that has\nbeen breaded and deep-fried.\nPreparation Tips\nKeep chicken refrigerated until you are ready\nto use it, or freeze it and then thaw it in the\nrefrigerator.  Cut away any excess fat, but\nkeep the skin on while cooking to provide\nflavor, then remove the skin for a healthier\nentrée.  Chicken lends itself to a variety of\ncooking preparations, including baking,\nbroiling, boiling, roasting, frying, braising,\nbarbecuing, stir-frying, and stewing.\nBoneless chicken requires less cooking time.\nHowever, this type of chicken will taste more\nbland because the bones and the skin add\nthat real “chickeny” flavor.  Yet, boneless\nchicken picks up the flavors of other foods,\nherbs, and spices it is cooked with, such as\ntarragon, ginger, garlic, and vegetables.\nRoasted chicken\nDuck\nDuck, or duckling, includes any of the 80\ndifferent species of wild or domestic birds\nwith webbed feet.  Today, several major\nbreeds of duck are raised for their meat.\nThese domesticated ducks may be three\ntimes larger than their wilderness-reared\nrelatives.  \nDuck is very popular in Europe and\nChina, where more duck is eaten each year\nthan chicken.  In the United States, how-\never, duck is usually perceived as a special\nholiday dish, if eaten at all, because\nAmericans annually eat less than a pound\nof duck per person.  In contrast, Americans\neat close to 50 pounds of chicken per year.\nThe consumption level may be lower\nbecause Americans consider ducks to be\nfatty and scrawny.  The perception of ducks\nas fatty rings true, because ducks are one\nweigh between 3 and 7 1/2 pounds.  Older\nducks are generally larger.  Almost all ducks\nsold in stores are frozen so that they are\navailable year-round.\nPreparation Tips\nFresh duck should have a broad, fairly plump\nbreast; the skin should be elastic, not saggy.\nFor frozen birds, the packaging should be\ntight and unbroken.  Frozen duck should be\nthawed in the refrigerator, a process that takes\nfrom 24 to 36 hours, depending on the size\nof the bird. Duck should not be refrozen\nonce it has been thawed.\nBefore cooking, all visible fat should be\nremoved.  Also, prick the skin with a fork\nto help the fat melt and drip away from the\nbird during roasting.  Some cooks also\nremove the skin and underlying fat.  Cook\nwhole birds to 180° Fahrenheit, breasts to\n170° Fahrenheit, and legs, thighs, and wings\nto 180° Fahrenheit.\nServing Suggestions\nDuck can be prepared in a variety of ways,\nincluding roasting, braising, and broiling.\nDucklings are best roasted in the oven on\na rack so that as much fat as possible can\ndrip away from the bird.  A citrus sauce\nnicely complements a duck’s flavor; accord-\ningly, the dish called duck à l’orange is one\nof the most popular ways to eat this bird. \nAllow about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of raw\nbone-in duck per person.  This will yield 3\nto 4 ounces of fully cooked duck.  (One\npound of boneless raw meat, when cooked,\nwill serve 3 people.)\nGame Birds\nGame birds is a broad category that includes\nany wild bird hunted and eaten as food.\nThese birds include the following:\n294\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nof the highest-fat types of poultry.  The fat\n(mainly found within and beneath the skin)\nhelps keep the duck buoyant.  Duck is also\nrich in protein.  It is an excellent source of\nriboflavin, niacin, and phosphorus and is\na good source of iron, zinc, and thiamin.\nDuck’s reputation as scrawny may be unde-\nserved, however.  They do have a large\nskeleton and thus a relatively high propor-\ntion of bone.  But specialty breeds, such as\nMuscovy ducks, have increased breast size\nfor more meat.  The USDA grades duck\nquality with classifications A, B, and C,\nsimilar to other poultry. \nThe majority of ducks are really duck-\nlings, 6 to 8 weeks old.  Broilers and fryers\nare less than 8 weeks old.  Roasters are birds\nthat are slaughtered when they are no more\nthan 16 weeks old.  Domestic ducks can\nPeking duck — a Chinese delicacy in which the duck is roasted\nuntil the skin is very crisp.  Small slices are served with\nmandarin pancakes, scallions, and hoisin sauce.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n295\nGoose is federally inspected for whole-\nsomeness.  Grading is similar to that of\nother poultry.  One pound of boneless\ngoose will serve 3 people.  Each serving is\nabout 3 to 4 ounces.\nDuring the holidays, it may be possible\nto find fresh goose in stores.  At other times\nof the year, it is usually sold after it has been\nfrozen. \nBecause geese have so much fat, they\nare best roasted.  Piercing the skin while\nroasting will allow fat to escape, reducing\nthe fat content of the bird that is eaten.\nMonitor the bird closely, however.  The\nlarge amount of fat that cooks from a goose\ncan smoke and catch fire.  Larger, older\nbirds are tougher and should be cooked\n(after the skin and fat are removed) with a\nmoist-heat method, such as braising.\nServing Suggestions\nLike duck, cooked goose benefits from\nbeing served with a tart fruit sauce, which\nhelps offset any fatty taste.  Roast goose is\noften served surrounded by sweet potatoes.\nA salad featuring sliced oranges and onions\ncomplements the flavor of the goose and\nthe sweet potatoes nicely. \nkraut.  Small birds may\nbe stuffed with a few\ngreen olives and garlic. \nGoose\nGeese, those graceful,\nlarge birds with their\nlong necks, large beaks,\nand signature cry, have\nlong been a favorite tar-\nget for hunters.  One\nreason is that the birds,\nwhich often weigh\nabout 25 pounds, provide a lot of meat.  In\naddition, their flesh is tender and flavor-\nful.  Goose has long been a traditional hol-\niday dish and remains a popular dinner in\nEngland and northern and central Europe.\nGeese have not achieved the same pop-\nularity in the United States.  This may actu-\nally be an advantage because geese are one\nof the fattiest types of poultry.  Up to half\nthe calories in a serving of goose are derived\nfrom fat.  There are about 13 grams of fat\nin a skinless 3 1/2-ounce serving and up to\n22 grams for a serving with the skin on.\nGeese are often advertised at holidays in\nthe United States, but they are typically avail-\nable frozen all year.  Popular products made\nfrom goose include smoked goose breast,\ngoose liver pâté, and goose liver sausage.\nPreparation Tips\nA goose should be plump and have a good\nfatty layer, skin that is clean and unblem-\nished, and pinkish or light-red flesh.  A\nfrozen bird’s packaging should be tight and\nunbroken.  The goose should be thawed in\nthe refrigerator, a process that can take up\nto 2 days, depending on the size of the bird.\nThe goose should not be refrozen once it\nhas been thawed, a general rule with all\nfrozen products. \n•\nLarge birds such as wild turkey and\ngoose\n•\nMedium-sized birds, including pheas-\nant, guinea fowl, and wild duck\n•\nSmall birds, such as grouse, hazel hen,\nlark, mud hen, partridge, pigeon, and quail\nGame birds that have domestic coun-\nterparts, such as turkey and duck, can\nprovide an overwhelming taste if you have\ngrown used to the supermarket variety.\nHowever, these birds are usually leaner than\nmass-market birds and even leaner than\nfarm-raised “wild” game.  If you are fortu-\nnate to have a hunter in the family, you may\nhave good access to game birds.  For most\npeople, however, finding game birds will be\ndifficult, although specialty stores may be of\nhelp.  Sometimes, game birds are sold frozen,\nand smaller birds may be sold canned.\nPreparation Tips\nWhen buying game birds, avoid those with\nan “off” odor.  If you are preparing birds you\nhave hunted yourself, check with a local hunt-\ning organization or gaming officer, because\npreparation tips differ from region to region\naccording to weather conditions.  Because\nwild birds can be the leanest of any poultry,\nthey may benefit from marinating.  They\nusually are also basted during roasting.  Older\nbirds are best cooked with slow, moist heat\nsuch as braising or used in soups or stews.\nDo not overcook game birds.  Test for\ndoneness by plunging a fork into the fleshi-\nest part of the thigh and by using a meat\nthermometer.  For light-fleshed birds, the\njuices should run clear.  For dark-fleshed\nbirds, the juices should be light pink.\nServing Suggestions\nGame birds can be used in place of tradi-\ntional poultry in many dishes.  In meals\nwith game birds as the main course, a\ntraditional side dish is potatoes or sauer-\nDomestic geese\n296\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nRoasted turkey\nTurkey\nOnce, turkey was for Thanksgiving and\nChristmas only.  In fact, 90 percent of all\nturkeys were sold during November and\nDecember.  It all started when wild turkey\nwas served as part of a feast of thanksgiv-\ning in 1621, and the tradition of turkey on\nthe Thanksgiving table endures.\nAmericans now embrace the turkey for\nmore than just special-occasion dining.\nToday, turkey is sold in supermarkets in\nparts, just like chicken, for ease of use.\nBreeders also have created smaller versions\nof turkey.  Served whole, these new birds\ncan weigh in at 5 to 8 pounds instead of\nthe standard sizes, which can be 20 or so\npounds at holiday time.\nTurkey is very similar to chicken in\nmany regards, both nutritionally and with\nrespect to USDA grading and storage\nrequirements.  The meat is high in protein,\nniacin, and vitamin B6.  It also provides a\ngood source of phosphorus and zinc.  Like\nchicken, turkey is a low-fat poultry choice,\ncontaining about 5 grams of fat per serv-\ning after roasting and removing the skin.\nTurkeys are available in supermarkets\nyear-round.  The skin on fresh turkey\nshould be off-white to cream-colored and\nthe meat should be pink.  Self-basting\nturkeys have butter or vegetable oil injected\nunder their skin to increase their flavor and\nmoistness, cutting down on the possibility\nof an overly dry dinner.  Turkeys also are\navailable smoked — as whole or breast only\n— or canned.\nPreparation Tips\nIf you are buying a frozen turkey, make sure\nit is rock-hard and free of any cuts or tears\nin the protective wrapping.  Then, defrost\nit using the same methods and precautions\nas recommended for chicken.\nIf you are buying a fresh turkey or fresh\nturkey parts, rinse the flesh with cold water\nand pat it with paper towels before cooking.\nFor thawing, which is always done in the\nrefrigerator, allow about 1 day for every 5\npounds of turkey.\nCheck to make sure you have removed\nthe giblets, heart, or other organs, which\nmay be packaged in the breast cavity.  Keep\nand cook the giblets separate from the\nturkey.  Regardless of when you cook the\nturkey, the giblets should be cooked or\nfrozen within 24 hours.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough turkey is traditionally stuffed\nand roasted, it can be cooked in several\nways.  Parts such as breasts, legs, and cutlets\ncan be prepared in the same way as a favorite\nchicken recipe.  Cooked and smoked\nturkey also goes well in cold salads and\nsandwiches.\nIf you are preparing the traditional\nturkey meal, estimate 3 hours for an\nunstuffed turkey of 8 to 12 pounds and 4\n1/2 hours for an unstuffed turkey of 18 to\n24 pounds.  Use a food thermometer.\nTurkey breasts should be cooked to 170°\nFahrenheit, and drumsticks, thighs, and\nwings to 180° Fahrenheit.  To ensure\nuniform cooking and safety, cook stuffing\noutside the bird.  If it is cooked inside the\nturkey, the center of the stuffing must reach\n165° Fahrenheit.\nEggs\nIn addition to being a popular breakfast\nfood, eggs are a symbol of beginnings.\nPrimitive humans recognized the egg as the\nbeginning of life, and it became a symbol of\nspring and fertility.\nEggs have four main parts:\nShell — As the name suggests, this is\nthe fragile and porous outer covering.  The\nshell is made mostly of minerals — calcium\ncarbonate, magnesium carbonate, and\ncalcium phosphate.\nShell membranes — These are layers\nof protein fibers that stick to the shell.  They\nprovide additional protection for the egg’s\ninsides, preventing mold and bacteria from\ngetting in, for example.\nAlbumen — This is the white of the\negg.  It is almost all protein and water.\nYolk — The yellow bull’s eye of the egg,\nthe yolk is made of a substance called\n“vitellus.”  It can be a pale yellow or dark\nyellow.  About 30 percent of the yolk is fat,\nand about 16 percent is protein.  The\nremainder is made up of solids.\nThere is no nutritional difference\nbetween brown and white eggs.\nEGG PRODUCTS\nTable-ready pasteurized liquid eggs\nare found in the refrigerated section\nof the supermarket.  The white and\nyolk of the eggs are mixed, then\npasteurized at a temperature high\nenough to kill any bacteria without\ncooking the eggs.  They can be\nrefrigerated unopened for up to 12\nweeks from the pack date.  They can\nbe used like eggs already scrambled.\nPasteurized eggs in their shells are\nalso now available.\nEgg substitutes are a blend of egg\nwhites and other ingredients such as\nfood starch, corn oil, skim-milk\npowder, tofu, artificial coloring, and\nvarious additives.  Because they are\nalmost all protein, egg substitutes\ncan become rubbery if overcooked. \nHigh-Protein Foods\n297\nEggs provide an inexpensive source of\nhigh-quality protein, vitamins, and min-\nerals, including vitamins A and B12, folic\nacid, and phosphorus.  They are an excel-\nlent source of riboflavin.  The egg is also\nsaid to be a complete protein, because it\ncontains a complete count of essential\namino acids.  The white supplies more than\nhalf the protein in an egg.  The yolk sup-\nplies the fat, along with the remaining\nprotein,  and most of the calories. \nEggs are also graded and are classified by\nboth size and quality.  The best are grade\nAA or A, both of which are related to the\nlevel of freshness and the quality of the shell\nat marking.  Most recipes are based on large\neggs.  Nutritionally, there’s no difference\nbetween brown eggs and white eggs.\nDifferent colored eggs come from different\nvarieties of hens.\nThe most common egg used for food\ntoday is the chicken’s egg, although eggs\nfrom other fowl can be bought in specialty\nstores.\nPreparation Tips\nWhen selecting eggs, check the container\nfor any cracked or broken eggs and elimi-\nnate them from the carton.  Place the carton\nin the refrigerator for up to 5 weeks.  Do\nnot place eggs in the designated egg holders\nin the door of older refrigerators.  It is too\nwarm for the eggs there because they get a\nblast of hot air each time the door is\nopened.  The egg carton helps keep eggs\nfrom absorbing odors from other foods and\nhelps keep the eggs fresh.\nWhen adding eggs to a mixing bowl,\nbreak the egg in a separate dish to make\nsure the egg is not rotten.\nServing Suggestions\nEggs serve many purposes in cooking and\npreparing food, including a leavening agent\nin baked goods, a base for mayonnaise, and\na thickener in sauces and custards.\nServed alone, eggs can be poached,\nboiled (soft or hard), fried, scrambled, or\nmade into an omelet.  From a safety stand-\npoint, it is recommended that both the\nyolk and the white be cooked until firm.\nBecause they are made mostly of water and\nprotein, eggs are best cooked over low heat.\nMeat \nMeat is the general term for any muscle\nfrom any animal.  However, most people\nthink of meat as meaning “red meat.”  This\nsection describes red meats, including the\ncommon American staples of beef, pork,\nlamb, and veal.  Also included are ostrich,\nrabbit, buffalo, and game meats.  Rabbit,\nbuffalo, and game meats were once com-\nmon to the American menu but are now\neaten much less often.  The same is true of\nso-called variety meats — brain, heart,\nkidney, liver, tripe, and tongue.  Whereas\nAmericans once needed to make use of\nevery part of a slaughtered animal, the\nabundance of food, along with changing\ntastes and attitudes, has made variety meats\nonly rare additions to meals.\nMeat is composed of three basic mate-\nrials: water, protein, and fat.  On average,\nlean muscle tissue is about 75 percent water,\n18 percent protein, and 3 percent fat.  The\neventual texture and taste of the cooked\nmeat depend on the amount of fat and\nwater in the tissue and on the kinds of\n298\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nproteins.  In general, the most tender cuts\nof meat have more fat and less fibrous\nmuscle.  Tougher tissue from older animals\noften has more flavor.  Both limitations can\nbe overcome by using the proper cooking\nmethods.\nRoughly 50 percent of the protein in\nmeat comes from fibers that contract the\nmuscle and 30 percent from oxygen-storing\npigments called myoglobin and various\nenzymes.  The remaining 20 percent comes\nfrom connective tissues that hold the muscles\ntogether.\nNutrition\nFrom a nutritional point of view, because\nthe composition of most animals is similar\nto that of humans, animal tissues supply\nus with complete proteins.  More simply,\nthe protein from animals is similar to that\nproduced in our own bodies.  Thus, it\ncontains the full count of essential amino\nacids.  (See Chapter 2, Dietary Protein and\nBody Protein, page 24.)\nRed meat is an important source of min-\nerals, including iron, phosphorus, zinc, and\ncopper, and vitamins, including B vitamins\nand vitamin A (see the Appendix:  Dietary\nReference Intakes, page 454).  However,\nthere are some  nutritional trade-offs to be\nmade.  Red meat can be the main source of\nfat — particularly saturated fat — and\ncholesterol in the American diet.  Both have\nbeen linked by numerous studies to cardio-\nvascular disease.  Too much fat and choles-\nterol can contribute to the buildup of plaque\nin arteries, which in turn increases the risk of\nheart attack and stroke.  In addition, diets\nhigh in fat have been linked to some types of\ncancer, particularly colon cancer. \nAmericans have traditionally enjoyed an\nabundance of meat in their diets compared\nwith other populations, and tastes in meat\ncontinue to evolve.  As more people have\nbecome aware of the risks of eating too much\nred meat, consumption of beef has declined.\nRecently, it has started to increase again and\nremains top on the consumption list.  An\nimportant reason is that as health concerns\nhave grown, both the meat industry and\ngrocers have responded by introducing leaner\ncuts of meat and lower-fat options, such as\nlean hamburger.  Poultry consumption has\ngrown significantly since the 1970s.\nSelection\nMany factors influence how tender and\ntasty meat will be after cooking.  These\nfactors include:\n•\nThe type of muscle (or cut)\n•\nThe amount of fat and connective tissue\nin the meat\n•\nThe age of the cut\n•\nThe manner of preparation\nCuts from more exercised muscles (leg,\nhip, and shoulder) are tougher than those\nfrom the center of the animal — the rib,\nloin, or breast.\nFresher meats are generally tougher than\naged meats.  Aging causes meats to go\nBEEF CUTS:\nWHERE THEY COME FROM\nSection\nNames of cuts\nRib:\nRib roast, rib steak, rib eye, back ribs\nShort Loin*:\nTip loin, T-bone, porterhouse, tenderloin\nSirloin*:\nTop sirloin, sirloin, Boston sirloin\nRound*:\nRound steak, top round, bottom round, eye of round, tip steak,\nrump roast\nFlank*:\nFlank steak\nPlate:\nSkirt steak\nChuck:\nChuck roast, arm pot roast, shoulder pot roast, short ribs\n*Cuts that are lower in fat.\nthrough “rigor.”  With time, the muscles\nrelax and increase in acidity — a natural\nway to tenderize meat — and muscle pro-\nteins increase their water-holding ability,\nwhich enhances juiciness.\nAging is a process that relaxes the tissues,\nmaking the beef easier to chew and enjoy.\nThe original process of aging, now called\ndry-aging, demanded that a carcass hang in\na cooler for 3 weeks or more.  The surface\nwould dry out and be thrown away.  The\nremaining beef made excellent but expen-\nsive steaks.  This process is now reserved for\nsteaks bound for only the best steakhouses.\nLess fatty cuts are preferred from a nutri-\ntional standpoint.  However, they are less\ntender than those with fat marbled through\nthe muscle fibers.  “Choice” and “select”\ngrades have less fat and marbling and can\nbe tougher than the “prime” grade unless\nthey are prepared to maximize tenderness.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n299\nillness.  In recent years, Escherichia coli (E.\ncoli), a potentially deadly bacterium that\ncan cause severe, bloody diarrhea, has\nbecome a concern with red meat, particu-\nlarly ground beef.\nFortunately, proper cooking kills all\nmicroorganisms in meat.  Preventing meat\nfrom contaminating other foods before cook-\ning is important.  Good meat-handling prac-\ntices include thawing meat in the refrigera-\ntor, making sure juices from raw meat do\nnot get on other food, and disinfecting cook-\ning and preparation surfaces after handling\nraw meat.  For more information about\ncooking meat and other protein foods prop-\nerly, see Chapter 5, Cooking It Safe, page\n149, and Food Safety, page 148.\nThe following pages contain more\nspecific information on different types\nof meat and how to include them in a\nhealthful diet.\nBeef\nBeef comes from the adult bovine, includ-\ning cows (females that have had a calf),\nsteers (males castrated when very young),\nheifers (females that have not been bred),\nand bulls younger than 2 years.  Beef from\nStorage\nMeat is perishable, but there are ways to\nmaximize its shelf life.  To do so, minimize\nits exposure to light, oxygen, enzymes, and\nmicroorganisms.  All of these can hasten\nthe breakdown of muscle tissue and the\ndecay process.\nKeep meat securely wrapped — preferably\nwith opaque butcher’s paper, available at gro-\ncery stores — and refrigerated at less than 40°\nFahrenheit in a dark place.  Bacteria and molds\nthrive in higher temperatures and humidity.\nRefrigerating meat inhibits the growth of these\nmicroorganisms, and freezing meat at 0°\nFahrenheit or below actually halts their growth.\nMeat wrapped in butcher’s paper can be stored\nin the freezer for up to 12 months. \nSafety Issues\nAny kind of meat can harbor harmful\nmicroorganisms that can cause food-borne\nQUICK TIP\nFreezer burn (the discoloration and\nchange in flavor that meat can\nacquire after it has been frozen) can\nbe minimized by wrapping meat as\ntightly as possible with waterproof\npackaging.  According to the USDA’s\nFood Safety and Inspection Service,\noverwrap the supermarket wrapping\nwith heavy-duty foil, plastic wrap, a\nplastic bag, or freezer paper to ensure\nthat air is kept out.\nIRRADIATED HAMBURGER\nConsumers in a growing number of states can now purchase irradiated hamburger\nat the supermarket.  So what does “irradiated” mean, and should you buy the meat?\nIrradiation is simply the name given to a process that uses radiation or electricity\nto kill disease-causing organisms (pathogens) in food.  Food is passed briefly through\neither type of energy.  It does not become radioactive.  Instead, the energy kills\nmost of the pathogens in food.  The food still looks and tastes the same.  By law,\nfood that is irradiated must have a label that clearly states it has undergone this\nprocess.  The symbol is called the radura.  (See Chapter 4, What About Irradiated\nFoods? page 91.)\nIrradiation has been used for decades to kill pathogens in spices and other foods\nand also to sterilize medical materials.  In February 1999, the U.S. government\ncleared the way for irradiated red meat to be made available in stores.  Because red\nmeat, and beef in particular, can harbor several pathogens, including the potentially\ndeadly E. coli bacterium, scientists and experts in food-borne disease have long\nadvocated irradiation as an important step in making this food group safer.\nIrradiation has its critics, who say that the method needs to be researched more.\nHowever, it is endorsed by nearly every major medical organization in the world,\nincluding the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, and the American Medical Association. \nan animal slaughtered after age 2 years is\ngenerally classified as “well-matured beef.”\nMeat from these animals begins to toughen\nand becomes more of a purplish red.  Baby\nbeef, in contrast, is from a 7- to 10-month-\nold calf. \nOf all the animals domesticated for\nfood, cattle reign supreme.  This animal,\nonce only a beast of burden, became a source\nof meat and milk only after feed from\nimproved agricultural practices became\nplentiful.\nEven though cattle were first introduced\nto the New World in the 1500s, beef did\nnot become popular in the United States\nuntil the Civil War, when other meats and\npoultry were in short supply.\nAfter the Civil War, the abundance of\ngrazing land and emerging transportation\nsystems in the United States made it easy\n300\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nhave hit the shelves.  The result is that beef is\n27 percent leaner than it was 20 years ago. \nWhen eaten in moderation and pre-\npared with low-fat cooking methods, beef\nremains a nutritious addition to meals. \nPreparation Tips\nWhen shopping, pick a cut of beef whose\ntenderness and level of flavor appropriately\nfit the recipe you are using.  In general, the\nmore expensive the cut of meat (rib, loin,\nbreast, filet, sirloin), the greater the flavor\nand tenderness.  Cheaper cuts (leg, hip,\nshoulder) may be less tender but are just as\nflavorful.  They are best prepared with slow,\nmoist-heat cooking, such as boiling, poach-\ning, stewing, steaming, or braising.  Any of\nthese moist-cooking methods are also best\nfor any leaner, tougher cut of beef (leg, hip,\nshoulder), and slow cooking provides the\nbest results.\nUsing a tenderizer also makes tough\ncuts more palatable.  Acid ingredients such\nas vinegar, yogurt, cider wine, citrus juice,\nand tomatoes often are used in marinades\nbecause they tenderize the meat.  Natural\nenzymes such as papaya, figs, and pineapple\nalso can be used for the same purpose.\nCover meat with the marinade and place\nit in a non-metallic container in the refrig-\nerator for 6 to 24 hours.\nAged beef that you might find at your\nlocal supermarket probably has undergone\nwet-aging.  The carcass is vacuum-packed\nin plastic bags and then placed in coolers\nfor a week to a month.  This process ten-\nderizes the beef, but it does not have the\ndramatic improvement in flavor that occurs\nwith dry-aging. \nGround beef contains enough fat (about\n15 to 20 percent) to give it flavor and make\nit juicy without excess shrinkage.  The most\nflavorful hamburgers are made with ground\nchuck, but that is not the only kind of\nto move large amounts of beef throughout\nthe country.  For years, Americans have been\none of the world’s top consumers of beef.\nBut in response to concerns about red meat’s\nlink to cardiovascular disease and cancer,\nconsumption has declined significantly.\nSince 1978, beef consumption has dropped\n28 percent, whereas poultry and pork con-\nsumption has grown rapidly.  Beef producers\nhave launched several programs to provide\nleaner beef products.  The industry has\ndeveloped leaner beef breeds, let the animals\nforage from grasslands instead of grain lots,\nand developed economic incentives for pro-\nducing leaner cattle.\nRetailers also have reduced the average\nthickness of fat around the edge of steaks and\nroasts from 3/4 inch to 1/10 inch, and some-\ntimes no external fat is present at all.  In addi-\ntion, low-fat ground beef and other meats\nAll meat sold in the United States\nmust be inspected for wholesomeness\nby the government, usually by the\nUSDA nationwide team of meat\ninspectors.  Many people are familiar\nwith this agency’s stamp of inspection,\nwhich is placed on the outside of \nthe carcass.\nThe USDA also grades meat,\nalthough this is a voluntary process.\nGrading meat essentially means using\ncategories to give consumers an\nestimation of quality.  Beef cuts \nare judged by the palatability\ncharacteristics of the meat.  Inspectors\nlook at the marbling (flecks of fat \nin the meat that give it flavor) and \nthe firmness.  The USDA grades \nfor beef, from best quality to lowest\nquality, are as follows: \n•\nPrime\n•\nChoice\n•\nSelect\n•\nStandard\n•\nCommercial\n•\nUtility\n•\nCutter\n•\nCanner\nThe cuts given the highest grade\nalso have the most marbling.  To help\nmake leaner, more healthful cuts\nappealing to consumers, the USDA\ncame up with the term “select” for\ngood quality cuts of meat that were\nlower in fat.  Previously, the agency\nhad used the term “good.” \nMost consumers will not find the\nfive lowest-quality grades of beef in\nstores.  These generally are used only for\nsausages and in cured and canned meats.\nMAKING THE GRADE\nhamburger available.  The leanest (around\n11 percent fat) and most expensive of the\nground meats are ground round and ground\nsirloin.  New processing of ground meat is\nnow making available even leaner choices\n(around 5 percent fat).  The leaner choices\nare ideal for calorie and fat watchers, but\nthey have to be cooked carefully to avoid\ntheir becoming too dry.\nFor more flavorful cuts of meat, dry-\nheat cooking — roasting, baking, broiling,\nor grilling — is more common.  Try these\nmethods with steaks, tenderloins, and filets.\nTo reduce the fat content of beef sauces or\nsoups, refrigerate them and gently spoon\noff the fat layer that forms on the surface.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough beef can be part of a healthful\ndiet, the key is to think of it as a side dish\nand not the main entrée.  Dishes such as\nsirloin kabobs fulfill the craving for beef\nwithout the need to eat a lot of it.  Stir-fry-\ning, in which thin strips or chunks of beef\nare combined with large quantities of veg-\netables, is also an excellent way to have beef\nplay a supporting role at mealtime.  Stews\nand casseroles with vegetable-based sauces\nalso offer this advantage.\nAnother simple option is to cut down\non the amount of ground beef called for in\na recipe.  Reducing the amount of ground\nbeef by half cuts the calories, fat, and cho-\nlesterol by half.\nBuffalo\nBison, the shaggy, humped member of the\ncattle family, is the scientific name for what\nwe generally refer to as American buffalo.\nBuffalo once roamed the West in great\nherds.

It is available in some\nspecialty markets.  Although intro-\nduced some years ago, beefalo has\nbeen slow to gain popularity.  At the\nsame time, demand for ranch-raised\nbuffalo is increasing.\ntion of ranch-raised buffalo is bringing\nbison meat back to the American table.\nBuffalo is lower in fat than most cuts of\nbeef and chicken — as well as some fish.  It\nalso tastes like lean beef and has no gamey\nflavor.  Because of these characteristics, it is\nviewed by some food experts as the “gourmet\nfood of the future.”  Although many ranch-\ners and farmers have begun raising buffalo,\nso far the demand for it is outstripping supply.\nPreparation Tips\nTrim any excess fat before cooking.  Because\nbuffalo meat is so lean, it should be cooked\nslowly at a low heat.  Otherwise, the meat\nwill be chewy and flavorless. \nServing Suggestions\nGrill buffalo steaks at least 6 inches from\nthe heat source, basting often.  Cuts of\nbuffalo are similar to cuts of beef and can\nbe substituted in most beef recipes, as long\nas the meat is not cooked past medium-\nrare.  Remember, however, that buffalo\ncooks more rapidly than beef because it has\nless marbled fat.\nLamb\nSpanish padres and English pioneers brought\nthe first sheep to the United States.  Using\nsheep for meat and clothing, the padres\nexpanded their missions for the next 3 cen-\nturies.  Today, lamb is produced in every state\nin the United States, even though the average\ncitizen eats only 1 to 2 pounds of lamb a year.\nIn other countries, lamb is prized for\nits hearty flavor.  The American aversion\n302\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nPreparation Tips\nMany cuts of lamb are sold with the fat\nalready trimmed, but on some cuts, such\nas the leg or shoulder, thick external fat\nremains.  Have your butcher remove this\nlayer, or do it yourself before you are ready\nto cook the lamb.  Leaving the fat in place\nwill cause the amount of saturated fat to\nskyrocket, and the lamb will take on a\nstronger taste that many Americans, unac-\ncustomed to lamb, might find displeasing.\nLamb fat burns at a much lower tempera-\nture than other animal fat, and the lamb is\nleft with a smoky, fatty aftertaste.\nYou also need to remove the fell, a mem-\nbrane that encases the surface fat.  The fell\nis left on some larger cuts to help trap the\nnatural juices.  The fell is inedible, and neither\nheat nor seasonings can penetrate it.\nThe cuts you most often find at your\ngrocery store — leg of lamb, rack of lamb,\nchops, and loin — can be cooked by roast-\ning, broiling, sautéing, or grilling.  But if\nyou are planning to serve the lamb rare or\nmedium-rare, which is recommended, rib\nchops surpass shoulder chops.  A quick-\nread thermometer inserted in the thickest\nportion of the meat should read 145°\nFahrenheit (medium-rare).  Chops cut from\nthe shoulder are best slowly braised.\nThe size of a rack of lamb depends on\nthe kind of sheep.  An American-raised\nsheep will have a rack with seven to eight\nribs, weighing approximately 2 pounds and\nfeeding three or four people.  A rack from\na New Zealand sheep may weigh only 1\npound and feed two people. \nServing Suggestions\nLeg of lamb is a traditional dish at Easter,\nand lamb and mutton are common ingre-\ndients in Middle Eastern couscous dishes.\nLamb also makes a wonderful meat for\nkabobs, the best cut being leg meat cut into\ndifficult to buy in the United States.  Most\nlamb available at your local supermarket will\nbe the more tender spring lamb.  Lamb is\nleaner, too, because of selective breeding\npractices and because the meat is trimmed of\nmore excess fat before packaging.\nThere are five USDA grades for lamb,\nbased on the proportion of lean meat to\nfat:  prime, choice, select, utility, and cull.\nMost of the lamb sold today is choice.\nUse color as a guide to purchase lamb.\nA general rule is that the color gets darker\nas the animal gets older.  For example, baby\nlamb is pale pink, and regular lamb is pink-\nish red. \nYou also can use the weight of a leg of\nlamb to judge its age.  The more a leg weighs,\nthe older the animal was at slaughter.  A\nlarge leg, nearing 10 pounds, then, will have\nstrong flavor and tougher flesh.  Mutton\nlegs are around 12 pounds.\nto the meat may be because sheep were orig-\ninally bred for wool first and then con-\nsumed for meat.  The older lamb resulted\nin a stringy, tough piece of meat.  Today,\nanimals are bred for only one purpose, and\nthe meat has a finer consistency and a better\nflavor.\nTo qualify as a lamb, a sheep must be\nyounger than a year.  However, most lambs\nare sent to market at 6 months or younger.\nBaby lamb and spring lamb are both milk-\nfed and slaughtered before they are weaned.\nRegular lamb is slaughtered before it reaches\n12 months of age.  Lambs between 12 and\n24 months are yearlings.\nMutton, the meat of sheep more than 2\nyears old, has a much stronger flavor and\nless tender flesh.  Mutton has gained a rep-\nutation among Americans as inedible, but\nwith proper slow-cooking methods, that rep-\nutation is unwarranted.  Even so, mutton is\nA serving of meat is about \n3 ounces — about the size \nof one lamb chop.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n303\nServing Suggestions\nRub olive oil on ostrich before grilling, then\nseason with herbs or a touch of salt and\npepper.  Substitute ostrich in any recipe\ncalling for lean beef or venison.\nPork\nPork was popular early in American history\nbecause pigs offered large litters of offspring\nand meat that could be preserved by smok-\ning and pickling for long winter months.\nPigs also would eat anything available.  A\ntypical farmer owned four or five hogs.  An\nearly governor of Virginia was one of the\nfirst to introduce swine to the New World.\nThe state is famous for the quality of hams\nand other pork products produced there.\nAlthough pork generally refers to swine\nyounger than 1 year, most pork today is\nslaughtered at a younger age (6 to 9 months)\nto produce meat that is more tender and mild-\nflavored.  The diet of a hog before slaughter\nhas changed.  What the colonists once\nthought was a positive — that a pig would\neat anything — caused trichinosis, a food-\nborne disease that was once acquired almost\nexclusively from undercooked pork. Today’s\nhogs are fed a diet of grain, proteins, vitamins,\nand minerals, and trichinosis is thus rare.\n1-inch cubes.  Complementary seasonings\ninclude garlic, mustard, basil, mint, rose-\nmary, and sage.\nLamb fat solidifies once the meat cools,\nso the meat should be served on warm\nplates.  Lamb stew meat usually is cut from\nthe shoulder, neck, breast, or leg (this might\nalso be called a lamb shank).  Use it in place\nof beef, pork, or veal in any slow-cooked\nstew or braised meat recipe.  Use ground\nlamb as you would use ground beef.\nThe less tender cuts of lamb (shoulder,\nbreast, shank) are best marinated.\nOstrich\nWith origins in Africa and parts of south-\nwest Asia, the ostrich is a huge, flightless\nbird that can weigh up to 250 pounds and\nreach up to 7 feet in height.  For centuries\nits meat and eggs were sought, but now\nostrich can be raised like other forms of\nlivestock.\nAlthough still more exotic than a rib\neye steak, ostrich meat is showing up on\nmore and more restaurant menus, a direct\ncorrelation to the hundreds of ostrich ranches\nnow in the United States.  Some specialty\nmeat markets may carry, or will special\norder, ostrich meat.  The meat is deep red\nand looks like very lean beef.  Ostrich is low\nin saturated fat and has very little choles-\nterol.  Because ostrich is a bird, it technically\nis classified as poultry, but it tastes more\nlike venison and is similar to lean beef in\nits color and texture.\nPreparation Tips\nThe best ways to cook ostrich are by\nsautéing (pan frying or cooking) and quick\ngrilling.  Because it is such a lean meat, it\neasily becomes dry if overcooked.  The best\ncuts of ostrich are the fan fillet, inside strip,\ntenderloin, and oyster.\nUntil recently, pigs were bred to be hefty\nand fat, but pork has been gradually trans-\nformed by concerted breeding efforts to\nproduce leaner meat.  In general, today’s\nhogs provide meat that is lower in calories\nand higher in protein than just 10 years\nago.  On average, pork is 31 percent lower\nin fat and 14 percent lower in calories than\nit was in 1983.  However, not all pork cuts\nare lean, depending on the part of the pig\nused.  For example, bacon still has 14 grams\nof fat per ounce (about 4 slices), but extra-\nlean cured ham may have less than 2 grams\nof fat per ounce.\nPork is an extraordinarily versatile meat.\nPork comes to market in two basic forms:\nfresh and smoked.  Only about a third of all\npork is sold as fresh pork.  The majority is\ncured, smoked, or processed into items such\nas bologna and hot dogs.  The rump and hind\nlegs of the pig are usually cured and smoked\nas hams.  The same is true of the belly, or what\nbecomes bacon after curing and smoking. \nMost fresh pork comes from the pork\nloin and the shoulder, an area of the animal\nthat is also known as “Boston butt.”  This is\ncut into chops, steaks, roasts, cubes, and\nstrips.  The loin section has been so popular,\nhogs have been bred with one more rib\n(compared with lamb, beef, or veal) to\nPORK CUTS:  WHERE THEY COME FROM\nSection\nNames of cuts\nShoulder butt:\nCubed steak, blade steak, boneless and bone-in blade (Boston)\nroast, ground pork\nLoin:\nSirloin, rib chop, loin chop, country-style ribs, back ribs, \ntenderloin, Canadian bacon, center rib roast\nLeg:\nCenter ham slice, boneless ham, ham shank, leg cutlets\nSide (belly):\nSpareribs, slab bacon, sliced bacon\nPicnic shoulder:\nArm picnic, arm roast, arm steak, ground pork, pork hocks\n304\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nServing Suggestions\nMarinades made from citrus fruits add a\nnice accompanying flavor to pork.  The\nacid from the fruit also helps tenderize the\nmeat.  Pork holds up under some strong\nsauces, such as barbecue sauce.  Pork can\nbe sliced into medallions and added to stir-\nfry dishes or served with steamed vegetables\nfor an elegant entrée.  Sweeter foods, such\nas applesauce or sweet-and-sour sauces, also\ncomplement the flavor of fresh pork.\nHam\nHam comes from the rump and hind leg\nsections of the hog and is available in either\nfresh or cured forms.  Fresh ham commonly\nis roasted, but cured ham, which is often\nready-to-eat, can be quickly baked, pan-\nfried, or microwaved. \nThe meat is usually cured in one of three\nways:  dry salt curing, brine curing, or brine\ninjection curing.  For dry curing, the surface\nof the ham is heavily salted, and then the\nham is stored to allow the salt to saturate the\nmeat.  In brine curing, the ham is immersed\nin a sweet, seasoned brine.  If sugar is added\nto the curing mix, the ham may be labeled\nsugar-cured.  Most mass producers of ham\nuse the injection-curing method, in which\nthe brine is injected directly into the ham,\nshortening the curing process.\nAfter curing, a ham may be smoked to\nadd flavor and aging capability.  Gourmet\nhams are heavily smoked for a month or more.\nA wide selection of specially cured hams are\nalso imported from many European coun-\ntries, including German Westphalian ham,\nwhich is smoked with juniper berry and\nbeechwood.  Other specialty hams include\nEnglish York ham and French Bayonne.\nThe smoked flavor will vary depend-\ning on the type of wood used (usually hick-\nory or maple) and the addition of unusual\ningredients such as juniper berries and sage.\nPreparation Tips\nFresh pork was once cooked to an internal\ntemperature of 170° to 185° Fahrenheit to\navoid trichinosis.  But with the new lean-\ner pork, such a temperature is no longer\nnecessary, nor is it advised.  Cooking meat\nto this temperature will dry out the pork,\nmaking it chewy and hard to cut.  Some\nolder cookbooks on your shelf still may\nadvise this higher temperature as a guide,\nbut a better internal temperature is 160°\nto 170° Fahrenheit, which will produce\njuicy, tender meat.  At this temperature,\nthe inside of a fresh pork cut may still be\npinkish.  This tinge of color is nothing to\nworry about as long as the internal tem-\nperature has reached at least 160°.  That\ntemperature destroys any organisms that\ncould cause trichinosis. \nFresh cuts of pork can be prepared with\ndry-heat cooking methods of grilling, broil-\ning, and roasting, but marinating or basting\nmay be necessary to keep the meat tender.\nFresh pork cooked to an internal\ntemperature of 160° Fahrenheit\nwill be juicy, tender — and safe.\nincrease the loin’s length (see sidebar:  Pork\nCuts: Where They Come From, page 303).\nPork is a good source of thiamin, a B\nvitamin humans need to convert carbohy-\ndrates into energy.  It is also a good source\nof zinc.  The following pages provide an\noverview of the different types of pork.\nFresh Pork \nSome of the more popular fresh pork cuts\nare pork chops, pork loin, and pork ribs.\nThere are three types of pork ribs.  Spareribs\nare from the breast and rib sections and\nprovide little meat.  Back ribs, or baby-back\nribs, are cut from the loin, so they have\nmore meat.  Country-style ribs, from the\nshoulder end of the loin, have the most\nmeat, but not necessarily the most flavor.\nWhen purchasing fresh pork, look for\nmeat that is pale-pink with a small amount\nof marbling and white (not yellow) fat.  The\ndarker the pink flesh, the older the animal.\naway.  Microwaving is another option for\nreducing the fat in bacon.  Put paper towels\nunder and over the bacon to absorb the fat\nas the bacon is cooked.\nServing Suggestions\nBacon is too fatty and high in salt for every-\nday use.  On occasions when it is eaten,\nreduce the amount of bacon strips used in\nthe food.  Or, add flavor without using a lot\nof bacon by using bacon bits.  Even better,\ntry imitation bacon bits, which are not\nmade from bacon at all but from a vegetable\nprotein.  The result is bacon flavor with-\nout bacon’s nutritional drawbacks. \nRabbit and Hare\nRabbit meat is often compared to chicken,\nbut it has a sweeter, milder taste. Rabbit is\nalso a little leaner than chicken.  Three ounces\nof roasted rabbit has 7 grams of fat, whereas\nthe dark meat of a roasted chicken has 8 grams\nand the white meat 3 grams, skin removed.\nRabbit meat for the table can be from\neither wild or domesticated animals.  Farm-\nbred rabbits are somewhat fatter and blander\nin flavor than their free-roaming counter-\nparts.  They also have a fine-textured flesh\nthat is almost all white meat, unlike their\nwilder counterparts.  A mature rabbit\nweighs between 3 and 5 pounds, an amount\nthat will serve four people.\nMore than double the size of its rabbit\nrelative, the hare can weigh as much as 12 to 14\npounds.  Hares have longer ears than rabbits,\na notched lip, and powerful hind legs.\nWhether wild or domesticated, hares have a\ndarker flesh and heartier flavor than rabbits. \nPreparation Tips\nFresh and frozen rabbit is available dressed\neither whole or cut into pieces.  Young rabbits\nweigh around 2 pounds and should have a\nOnce curing and smoking are completed,\ngourmet hams are usually aged to develop\nflavors further, sometimes for up to 2 years. \nHams are sold in several forms, includ-\ning boneless (with the hip, thigh, and shank\nbones removed), partially boned (with the\nhip or shank bones removed), and bone-\nin.  Most producers of gourmet ham leave\nsome bone in to enhance the flavor during\ncooking.  Canned hams may be a whole\npiece of boneless meat or they may be\ncreated from bits and pieces of meat and\nheld together with a gelatin mixture. \nPreparation Tips\nA fresh or cured ham should look firm and\nhave a white layer of fat and pink to rose-\ncolored flesh.  Country-style hams (dry-\ncured hams) such as Smithfield hams are\ncoated with salt, so they should be scrubbed\nwith a stiff brush, soaked in cold water for\n48 hours, and then scrubbed again. \nLabels on hams should be checked for\ncooking and serving instructions, because\nhams are available fully cooked, partially\ncooked, or uncooked.  Fully cooked hams,\nsometimes labeled “heat-and-serve”or\n“ready-to-eat,” do not require additional\ncooking.\nServing Suggestions\nKeep in mind that the curing process for\nham makes it high in sodium.  Persons\nfollowing a low-sodium diet may want to\nsave ham for special occasions and mini-\nmize how much is eaten.  Those whose diets\ncan tolerate a high-sodium food can add\nlean or extra-lean ham to a wide variety of\ndishes.  Ham goes particularly well with\npasta and rice dishes and in combination\nwith vegetables.  Ham can be baked, grilled,\nsautéed, broiled, or simmered.  Try adding\nlean or extra-lean ham to make a hearty\nsalad that serves as the centerpiece of a meal.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n305\nBacon\nBacon is meat from the side of a hog —\nthe pork belly — that is cured and smoked.\nFat imparts the crispness and flavor to\nbacon and is usually half to two-thirds of\nthe total weight, making it more of a fat\nselection than a meat selection.  Bacon is\nalso high in sodium and contains nitrates\nand nitrites, which are chemical preserva-\ntives that have been shown to cause cancer\nin animals.  The amount in bacon is not\ngreat, and therefore it is not clear that they\nare harmful in the amounts normally con-\nsumed.  For all of these reasons, the regular\ninclusion of bacon at breakfast should be\nreconsidered.\nCompared with American bacon,\nCanadian bacon is more like ham, because\nit comes from the tender eye of the pork\nloin.  It is more expensive than regular bacon,\nbut it is leaner and precooked (less shrink-\nage), providing more servings per pound. \nSliced bacon comes in thin slices (about\n35 strips per pound), regular slices (16 to 20\nstrips per pound), or thick slices (12 to 16\nstrips per pound).  Canned bacon is popular\nwith campers because it is precooked and\nneeds no refrigeration.\nBacon bits are crisp pieces of bacon that\nare preserved and dried.  They should be\nstored in the refrigerator.  (A popular imi-\ntation made from vegetable protein may be\nkept at room temperature.)  Bacon grease,\nthe fat rendered from cooked bacon, is\nsometimes used as a cooking fat in regional\ndishes, as are salt pork (salt-cured cuts from\nthe sides and belly of the pig) and fatback\n(fat from the pig’s back, that can be salted\nand made into “cracklings” or unsalted and\nmade into lard). \nPreparation Tips\nYou can reduce the fat in bacon by broil-\ning it on a rack, allowing excess fat to drip\nlight-colored flesh.  They are considered\nthe most tender.  When cooking aged or\nwild rabbit, use moist heat to cook it (such\nas stewing, braising, or marinating) to ten-\nderize and whiten the meat.  Wild hare,\nalso called jackrabbit and snowshoe rabbit,\ngenerally needs marinating to tenderize it\nbefore cooking.  This process also whitens\nthe meat.  Young animals (1 year or less)\ncan usually be roasted, but older animals\nare best cooked with moist-heat methods,\nsuch as slow cooking in a casserole or stew.\nServing Suggestions\nIn general, recipes for rabbit, especially young\nrabbit, are similar to those for chicken.\nFrench and Italian recipes use rabbit with\nexcellent results.  Rabbit is traditionally\nserved in sauces to minimize a flavor that\ncan be intense.\n306\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nPreparation Tips\nAlthough veal is supposed to be leaner and\nmore tender than beef, not all veal is made\nequally, and not all cuts carry the same level\nof quality.\nIf you are interested in preparing veal,\nyour first step should be to locate a super-\nmarket or butcher who carries veal on a reg-\nular basis.  Because Americans tend to eat\nveal in restaurants, the retail market is much\nsmaller than beef’s beefy share.  You may\nneed to order the cut of veal you want and\nthe amount you need in advance.\nThe best cuts are from the rib and the\nloin of the calf.  They are the most tender\nand the most expensive and can be bought\nas ribs, chops, or scallops.\nVeal scallops have many names —\nscallopini, cutlets, schnitzel.  However, all\nthese words describe thinly cut veal slices.\nThe best scallops come from the top round,\ncut against the muscle fibers.  Cutting\nagainst the grain ensures the thin scallops\nwill not buckle when they hit the heated\npan.\nIf you are buying scallops, look for a\nsmooth surface, which indicates they have\nbeen cut properly.  Storage of veal is similar\nto that of beef.\nServing Suggestions\nVeal scallops can be used to make veal scal-\nlopini.  Scallops are dredged in flour and\nlightly cooked in oil or butter for 1 to 2\nminutes.  Veal roast can be cooked with\neither low or high heat, but high heat works\nbetter with more expensive cuts of meat.\nFor cuts from the shoulder, breast, or leg,\nroasting at a lower heat with rubbing of\nadded fat creates a more tender entrée.\nTougher cuts of veal from the lower leg\nand shoulder can be braised for the Italian\ndish osso buco.  The name means “bone\nwith a hole.”  The bone is a marrow-filled\nVeal\nCredit the American love of Italian and\nFrench food to the increase in veal appre-\nciation.  Dishes such as veal scallopini and\ngrilled veal chops introduced the meat to\npalates that were much more aware of the\nheavier, heartier taste of beef.\nThe name veal is derived from the Latin\nvitellus, which means calf.  The meat is\ngarnered from a young calf, usually 1 to 3\nmonths old, that has been fed only milk.\nMilk-fed veal comes from calves up to\n12 weeks old that have not been weaned from\ntheir mother’s milk, but veal of this quality is\nrare in today’s supermarket.  Shoppers are\nmore likely to find veal fed a nutritionally\nbalanced milk or soy-based diet that is for-\ntified with essential nutrients.  Color is the\nmost important criterion when choosing a\ngood cut of veal.  The flesh should be a\ncreamy white to ivory tone — barely tinged\nwith grayish pink — and the fat should be\nwhite and creamy.  The pinker the meat, the\nolder the animal was at slaughter, and the\nmeat is tougher and stronger-flavored.\nIf the meat is a reddish tone but still\nmarked as veal, it may be a calf between 6\nand 12 months and should more appro-\npriately be called baby beef.  Or, the calf\nmay have been allowed to eat grains or\ngrasses, which also darken the meat.\nAnimals were once confined to limit\ntheir movement; hence, the meat would be\nmore tender and pale.  For that reason, the\nconsumption of veal was a source of con-\ntroversy.  In recent years, veal producers\nhave attempted to make their modes of pro-\nduction more humane.\nThe USDA can grade veal in five different\ncategories, but it usually does not.  If the veal\nhas been categorized, it will carry marks of\n(from highest quality to lowest) prime, choice,\ngood, standard, and utility.  The last three\ngrades are rarely sold in retail outlets.\nJUGGED HARE\nYou might have heard of this classic\nEnglish dish.  The main ingredient \nis a hare that has been soaked in a\nmarinade of red wine and juniper\nberries for a day or more.  The\nmarinated meat is browned and then\nmade into a casserole that includes\nvegetables, seasonings, and stock for\nbaking. Juices from this mixture are\npoured off after cooking and com-\nbined with cream, blood from the\nhare that was set aside at butchering,\nand the hare’s liver, which has been\npulverized.  The strained sauce is\nserved over the meat and vegetables.\nBecause the dish was historically\nserved in a crock or jug, the dish has\nbeen referred to as “jugged hare.” \nusually feeds two people.  Brain also may be\nadded to salads or stuffing or served in soups.\nHeart\nWhen the Indians of America hunted bison,\nthe heart went to the warrior who brought\nhome the beast because this organ was\nthought to contain the essence and there-\nfore the power of the slain animal.\nBecause heart consists almost entirely\nof a hard-working muscle, it tends to be\ntough.  In general, hearts from young\nanimals are more tender.  Your supermarket\nmay stock veal, lamb, and pork hearts, but\nbeef heart is more commonly available.  The\nheart is an excellent source of protein, iron,\nzinc, riboflavin, folic acid, and vitamin B12\nand a good source of niacin.  It has more\ncholesterol than regular types of meat.\nHowever, it has less cholesterol than kidney,\nliver, or brain.\nround in the center of the cut that adds\nflavor and is considered a velvety treat.\nVeal chops and medallions are best pre-\npared by pan frying or grilling.  Chops\nshould be at least an inch thick, and medal-\nlions should be about 3/4-inch thick.\nOtherwise, the veal will dry out.\nBecause veal is such a lean meat, many\nrecipes may call for adding fat of some sort:\nfrom a health standpoint, a small amount\nof olive oil is best. Watch closely, because\nveal cooks quickly and it is very easy to over-\ncook it.\nVariety Meats\nVariety meats is a category that includes\nbrain, heart, kidney, liver, and various other\nmeats.  Because they are the most perish-\nable parts of the animal, they were tradi-\ntionally eaten first.  And often, these meats\nwere the centerpiece of some great feast. \nMany variety meats are too high in fat\nand cholesterol for more than an occasional\nindulgence, although they are a good\nsource of iron and, often, vitamin A and\nfolic acid.  However, some variety meats,\nsuch as calf’s tongue and heart, may be\nunfairly neglected.  They are a good low-\nfat source of protein, vitamins, and min-\nerals.  They also can be very economical,\nyet they are scarce in your local market.\nYou may need to order variety meats from\na butcher or ethnic food store.  The fol-\nlowing is an overview of the main kinds of\nvariety meats.\nBrain\nBrain is very soft and porous and is consid-\nered a delicacy in many parts of the world.\nAlthough eaten far less often in Western\nnations, beef, calf, pork, and lamb brains are\navailable in many supermarkets.  Calf brain\nHigh-Protein Foods\n307\nusually is recommended most often for use\nin dishes because of its flavor and texture.\nBrain should be a bright pinkish white,\nplump, firm, and absolutely fresh.  Brain\nthat is shriveled and dry should be avoided.\nIt is perishable and should be used the day\nof purchase.\nPreparation Tips\nBrain should be washed well, then blanched.\nAlthough they differ in flavor and texture,\nbrains and sweetbreads (see below) are used\ninterchangeably in most recipes.\nServing Suggestions\nBrain can be poached, fried, baked, or\nbroiled, and is sometimes served as “beurre\nnoir.”  This is a sauce that has a clarified\nbutter base that is heated until dark brown.\nBrain also can be combined with scrambled\neggs for a Southern delicacy.

Pig\nand chicken hearts should be bright red,\nand calf heart should be light red.\nPreparation Tips\nTrim fat from the heart and remove veins\nand membranes.  Rinse and clean the heart\nthoroughly.  The heart can be cooked and\nserved whole or sliced.  Cooking times vary\ndepending on the method used.  Sliced heart\nis fried for 5 to 7 minutes.  When braising\nthis meat, hearts of young animals should\nbe cooked 2 to 3 hours.  Larger hearts may\nneed to be braised for 4 to 6 hours.\nServing Suggestions\nHearts make excellent additions to stews and\ncasseroles.  Small hearts, such as those from\nyoung lambs and pigs, are often stuffed and\nsautéed.  They also can be roasted.  Typically,\nsmall hearts are served one per person.\nKidney\nKidneys typically used for cooking are beef,\nveal, lamb, and pork.  The shape of the\nkidney depends on its source.  Beef and veal\nkidneys are multilobed and elongated.  In\ncontrast, lamb and pork kidneys have just\none lobe that resembles a giant bean.\nKidneys from young animals tend to have\na more tender texture and more delicate\nflavor.  In addition, young animals’ kidneys\nare usually pale.  Those from older animals\nare a deep reddish brown.\nIn selecting kidneys, look for those\nthat are firm and have a glossy, even color\nwithout dry spots.  Kidneys should be\nused the day they are purchased, or stored\nloosely wrapped in the refrigerator for up\nto 1 day. \nPreparation Tips\nRemove the white membrane around the\nkidney by using a pair of scissors to snip\nthe membrane from the core.  Then, peel\nthe membrane back with your fingers\nand remove any excess fat.  Kidneys may\nbe soaked in vinegar or lemon water to\nreduce the strong odor.  Pork and large beef\nkidneys should be soaked in milk or cold\nsalted water for 2 hours to minimize their\nstrong taste. \nServing Suggestions\nKidneys are eaten braised, broiled, simmered,\nor cooked in casseroles, stews, and dishes\nsuch as the well-known British dish beef-\nsteak and kidney pie.  This dish is also com-\nmonly served in areas along the Canadian\nborder in the United States.  Nearly every\ncomprehensive cookbook has a recipe for\nthis meat pastry.  One calf kidney or two\nlamb kidneys is considered a serving.\nLiver\nAfter beef and calf liver, the most common\nanimal livers eaten are lamb, pork, poultry,\nand goose.  Goose and duck livers are used\nmainly to produce the famous pâté de foie\ngras.  Fresh American foie gras must come\nfrom ducks, but imported foie gras can come\nfrom either goose or duck.  These birds are\nspecifically bred with enlarged livers.\nAn important note is that the liver\nprocesses most substances that enter the\nbody.  This includes any chemicals that an\nanimal might be fed or given as a medica-\ntion.  The older the animal, the more likely\nit is that there may be accumulations of\nunwanted residues in this organ.  For this\nreason, liver from younger animals is gen-\nerally preferred. \nFresh liver should have a bright color, a\nmoist but not slick surface, and a clean\nsmell.  Loosely wrap it and refrigerate it\n308\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nimmediately.  Liver does not keep for more\nthan a day. \nPreparation Tips\nLiver is encased in a thin membrane, which\ntoughens in the cooking process and should\nbe peeled off before cooking.  Be careful not\nto overcook liver because it toughens quick-\nly when overcooked.  One popular solution\nis to sauté liver.  Leave the liver a little pink\nin the center when you use this method and\nlet the residual heat finish the job.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough liver typically is not considered a\npopular food, this organ meat can be tasty.\nIt is commonly served with gravy made from\nit and onions.  For a more elegant meal,\nbroil or pan cook cubed liver and serve with\nmustard and boiled new potatoes.  Liver\nalso can be roasted (at 325° Fahrenheit for\nabout 15 minutes per pound) and also\nserved with boiled new potatoes.  Soaking\nthe liver in cognac for several hours before\ncooking adds a rich flavor to roasted liver.\nSausage\nBorn of economic necessity, sausage mak-\ning has now become an art.  When farmers\nslaughtered their own animals, they wanted\nto make sure that they used every part of the\nanimal.  So, the lesser quality cuts and scraps\nwere ground up and made into sausages.\nSausage essentially is any kind of chopped\nor ground meat that is stuffed into a casing.\nMost often, pork is the main ingredient in\nsausage, but poultry or fish can be used.\nAfter countless decades of experimen-\ntation in ingredients — which include meat,\nspices, and fillers — sausages are often now\nconsidered a delicacy.  They can be differ-\nent in taste from one to the next.  Sausages\nare fresh (made of raw ground meat and\nspices), precooked (such as hot dogs or\nHigh-Protein Foods\n309\nLiver pâté\nHowever, farm-raised animals may have\nmore fat and be more tender than their wild\ncounterparts. \nGame animals are categorized as large\ngame and small game.  Large game animals\ninclude deer, elk, moose, caribou, and ante-\nlope.  Other popular large game animals\ninclude wild boar and bear.  Other varieties\neaten around the world include camel,\nelephant, kangaroo, zebra, and wild sheep.\nThe most common small game animal is\nwild rabbit.  Squirrel is also popular.  Beaver,\nmuskrat, opossum, raccoon, armadillo, and\neven porcupine are also eaten.\nPreparation Tips\nAny game meat found in commercial\nmarkets is federally inspected.  The skin\nof a hunted animal should be removed\nand specific steps for butchering should\nbe followed.  The animal also can be taken\nto a butcher who specializes in game\npreparation.\nFor maximum tenderness, most game\nmeat should be cooked slowly and not\noverdone.  Cooking can be done with moist\nheat by braising or with dry heat by roasting. \nMeat from older animals can be ten-\nderized in a marinade that contains an acid\nsuch as vinegar to break down tough fibers,\noil to add succulence, and wine, herbs, and\nspices to permeate the meat with flavor to\nreduce the “gamey” taste.  Meat should\nalways be marinated in the refrigerator\nbecause it takes quite long to mellow the\nflavor and tenderize (3 to 5 days). \nServing Suggestions\nRoasts and steaks may be served for special\noccasions.  When ground, they may substi-\ntute for more traditional patties, meat loafs,\nor casseroles.  Small pieces may be stewed.\nbologna), or partially dried and fully cured\n(such as salami or dried pepperoni).\nPreparation Tips \nHow you use the sausage depends on the type\nyou buy.  Fresh sausages need to be cooked,\noften by pan frying.  Precooked sausages may\nneed no preparation at all, or they can be\ngrilled, broiled, or poached in hot water.\nFresh sausage can be kept for only about\n2 days in the refrigerator.  Dried or semi-\ndried will last 2 to 3 weeks.  Cooked sausage\ncan be kept for about a week.\nServing Suggestions\nPartially dried and fully cured sausages may be\nused in sandwiches or cut up for pizza or paella.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that sausages are\nladen with sodium, calories, and fat.  Reduce\nthe amount of fat in the sausage you eat by\ndraining the excess fat during cooking or by\nselecting the reduced-fat and reduced-sodium\nvarieties of sausages now available in stores.\nMinimize the amount of sausage you\neat by using it as a flavoring in meals instead\nof a main course.\nGame Meats\nGame meat was once classified as wild\nanimals hunted for human consumption.\nHowever, because many “wild” animals are\nnow being raised as livestock on farms or\nhunted in protected environments, the\ndefinition has changed slightly to include\nanimals once hunted in the wild for meat.\nThe graying of the term also has made\nnutritional generalizations difficult.  Because\nthe diets and activity levels of domesticated\ngame animals are different from those of\ntheir roaming counterparts, their meat has\na different flavor and is often described as\nhaving a milder, less gamey taste.  Meat\nfrom wild animals also may be lower in fat\nthan meat from farm-raised animals.\nFish\nHealth-conscious Americans are figuring\nout what much of the world already knows.\nWhen prepared well, seafood tastes good,\nand it is good for you.  Fish consumption\nincreased 3.5 percent in 1998 and 3.7\npercent in 1999.\nThe variety and convenience of fish may\nbe causing the increase, because markets\nacross the country — even those in the\nlandlocked states — are stocking live shell-\nfish and fresh fillets from both coasts.  What\nonce seemed intimidating to meat-eating\nAmericans can now be cooked with the\nsame ease as a pork chop or pot roast.\nNutrition\nSeafood is a good source of high-quality\nprotein, usually with a low number of\ncalories.

Most fish have\nlevels of cholesterol comparable to that of\nthe white meat of poultry and of lean, well-\ntrimmed red meat. \nFish also contain important vitamins\nand minerals, especially some of the B\nvitamins, iron, potassium, magnesium, and\nphosphorus.  Saltwater fish supply iodine.\nCanned salmon, sardines, and herring, with\ntheir soft bones, which are mostly edible,\nare also a good source of calcium. \nIn general, fish are low in sodium, sim-\nilar to the amount in red meat and poultry.\nPersons following low-sodium diets should\nlimit their intake of processed salted or dried\nfish, pickled herring, smoked fish and\nshellfish, sardines, surimi products, and\nanchovies.\nSelection\nWhat to look for depends on the type of\nfish being purchased: \nWhole, fresh fish — The criteria for\nbuying this type of fish boil down to this:\nlook for the fish that appears to have been\npulled from the water most recently.  Scales\nshould be shiny and stuck firmly to the\nskin.  The flesh should feel firm and should\nnot pull away easily from the bone.  Gills\nshould be moist and red, and the eyes\nshould be shiny and not sunken.  As always,\nthe odor is a telltale sign of fish freshness.\nThe fish should have a mild, fresh smell.\nThe more fishy a fish smells, the less likely\nit is fresh.\nFresh fillets and steaks — These, too,\nmust pass the smell test.  In addition, check\nthe flesh to make sure it does not pull away\nfrom the bones.  Don’t buy fish that appears\nto be discolored or dried out. \nFrozen fish — Avoid dried-out fish.\nPackaging should be intact and free of frost.\ncalories for many lean fish and most shell-\nfish.  Even oil-rich fish, such as salmon,\ntuna, and mackerel, generally have fewer\nthan 225 calories in a 3-ounce portion,\ncomparable to the calories of lean meats.\nThe fat in fish is mainly polyunsatu-\nrated and monounsaturated rather than sat-\nurated, as in meat.  Furthermore, fish have\na unique polyunsaturated fatty acid called\nomega-3 that is believed to have a beneficial\neffect in reducing blood clots, lowering\nblood cholesterol levels, and minimizing\nheart disease (see Chapter 3, Coronary\nArtery Disease, page 61).  The fish that are\nparticularly good sources of omega-3 fatty\nacids are sardines, herring, mackerel,\nAtlantic bluefish, tuna, salmon, pilchard,\nbutterfish, and pompano.\nMost shellfish were once considered\nhigh in cholesterol.  However, new research\nhas shown that although shrimp and squid\nhave high levels of cholesterol, other shell-\nfish, including clams, mussels, oysters,\nCommercial fishing allows consumers \nwho are land-locked to enjoy fresh fish.\nSalted and smoked fish — Avoid fish\nwith an “off” odor.\nStorage\nWhether the fish you buy is fresh or frozen,\nmake it the last thing you purchase before\nheading home.  If you will be delayed, have\nthe market pack fresh fish on ice.\nImmediately refrigerate fresh fish in the\ncoldest part of your refrigerator (usually the\nlowest shelf at the back or in the meat\nkeeper), and use it within a day or two.\nFreeze your fish quickly to keep cell walls\nintact, but thaw the fish gradually so that\nfewer juices leak out of cells.  The best way\nto defrost fish is overnight in the refrigera-\ntor.  If you must thaw fish quickly, seal it\nin a plastic bag and immerse it in cold water,\nallowing 1 hour to thaw a 1-pound package.\nYou can also microwave frozen fish on the\n“defrost” setting, stopping when the fish is\nstill icy but pliable.  Most fish will keep in\nthe freezer for about 6 months.  Never\nrefreeze fish.\nCanned fish, such as tuna, salmon, and\nsardines, will keep for about a year or less.\nHowever, because you cannot be sure about\nthe conditions in which canned goods have\nbeen stored in the warehouse, it is best to\nbuy only what will be used within a few\nmonths.\nPreparation\nMoist-heat cooking methods (poaching,\nsteaming, or stewing) are best-suited for\nlean fish such as cod, flounder, or sole.  Dry-\nheat cooking methods such as baking, broil-\ning, and grilling are best suited for moderate-\nto high-fat fish, such as bluefish, butter-\nfish, catfish, or salmon. En papillote, the\nFrench technique of cooking fish enclosed\nin parchment paper or foil, is an elegant\nway to keep fish moist.  To determine\nwhether fish is done, evaluate the color and\nHigh-Protein Foods\n311\nSafety Issues\nAlthough most seafood that reaches the con-\nsumer is safe, fish spoilage and contamination\ndo occur.  Bacteria, viruses, and other microor-\nganisms can contaminate fish.  Without care-\nful handling, these can spread to humans\nthrough undercooked fish or cross-contami-\nnation, which occurs when surfaces used to\nprepare fish are not disinfected. \nLike all living organisms, fish can occa-\nsionally carry various parasites.  These\nparasites are easily destroyed by normal cook-\ning procedures.  In pickled products, such\nas pickled herring, the acidity of the vinegar\nused in pickling, often in combination with\nsalt, preserves products and destroys para-\nsites and harmful bacteria.\nTo prevent food-borne illness, the\nUSDA advises avoiding raw seafood or\nlightly marinated raw seafood of any kind.\nflakiness of the flesh.  Slip a knife into the\nfish and pull the flesh aside.  The edges of\nthe flesh should be opaque and the center\nsomewhat translucent.  The flesh should\njust barely flake.  For large fish, a meat ther-\nmometer can be used to determine whether\nthe fish is cooked thoroughly.  The flesh\nshould reach 145° Fahrenheit to be con-\nsidered done.  Fish continue to cook after\nthey are removed from heat.  For that\nreason, it is often recommended that you\nstop cooking fish just before it appears to be\ndone.  Overcooked fish looks dry, falls apart\neasily, and does not have many of its natural\njuices left over.\nMarinades are an excellent way to add\nflavor with little fat to fish.  Make sure that\nyou marinate the fish in the refrigerator to\nprevent harmful microorganisms, if pres-\nent, from multiplying.\nFish steak, fillet, and\nbutterfly fillet\n312\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nis a medium-sized fish.  It is  usually caught\nat weights between 4 and 9 pounds and\nmeasures between 15 and 52 inches.  It has\na firm, white flesh.\nPreparation Tips\nCod is a versatile fish and is available fresh\nor canned.  It can be cooked in a variety of\nways.  If you poach it, make sure that it\ndoes not boil.  Instead, simmer it for 8\nminutes in a bouillon or add it to an already\nboiling liquid and then remove the pan\nfrom the heat immediately.  Set it aside until\nthe fish is cooked (about 15 minutes).  The\nroe, or eggs, of the cod are eaten fresh,\nsmoked, or salted.  The oil extracted from\ncod livers is an important source of vitamins\nA and D.\nServing Suggestions\nGarlic and dill are two seasonings that com-\nplement this light, flaky fish.  Another popular\ndish is cod cakes, which are simply a varia-\ntion on the widely available recipe for crab\ncakes.  Cod also can be cured in lye to make\nlutefisk, a Scandinavian delicacy popular in\nthe Midwest for which one acquires a taste.\nROUND AND FLAT FISH\nThe term “fish” includes thousands of different species.  For preparation purposes,\nit is necessary to know only that they are generally divided into two main groups:\nround fish and flat fish.\nRound fish. As the name suggests, round fish have a plump shape.  Their eyes\nare on either side of their head.  Here is the critical part: their backbone runs down\nthe center.  Because thick fillets lie on either side, round fish are usually used as\nfillets or steaks.  Examples include salmon, red snapper, and striped bass.\nFlat fish. This group’s name also gives away its anatomy.  This fish swims\nhorizontally and is shaped like a flat, thin disk.  Its eyes are on the top of the head.\nThe backbone is located in the center of the fish.  Fillets do not come from either\nside, as they do in round fish, but from the top and bottom.  Fillets are typically\ncut from flat fish, but larger fish may be cut into steaks.  Examples of flatfish\ninclude flounder, halibut, and sole.\nARE THERE HARMFUL CHEMICALS IN FISH?\nBecause of pollution in oceans, lakes, and rivers, fish may contain harmful chemi-\ncals such as mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  This may be a particular\nproblem in areas where there are manufacturing plants that burn fossils fuels or, in\nthe past, have dumped mercury-containing waste into nearby streams and lakes.\nFish at the top of the food chain (generally, the bigger types such as shark or sword-\nfish) may contain higher amounts of mercury or other harmful chemicals because\nthey feed on lesser fish and cumulate these substances in their fat and flesh.  Some\nspecies such as large tuna (typically sold as fresh steaks or sushi) can also contain\nhigher amounts.  Various health agencies have issued advisories on how much fish\nis safe to eat, particularly for pregnant or nursing women and children.  The Food\nand Drug Administration recommends that if you are pregnant or may become\npregnant, you should  avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.  If \nyou are considering having a child or are pregnant or nursing, check with your\nphysician if your diet includes a lot of fish. \nThis advice includes sushi.  It is particularly\nimportant for people in high-risk groups,\nwhich include older people, pregnant\nwomen, infants, and persons with liver dis-\nease, diabetes, immune disorders, or gas-\ntrointestinal conditions.\nFish are generally a low-fat source of\nprotein.  Not all fish have equal amounts\nof fat, however.  Instead, fish are grouped\ninto three main categories according to their\nfat content: lean, moderate-fat, and high-\nfat.  The next section introduces you to the\ntypes of fish in each group.\nLean Fish \nLean fish have less than 2 1/2 percent fat.\nThe flesh of these fish is lightly colored and\nhas a mild taste.  Commonly available\nvarieties of lean fish include cod, flounder,\nhalibut, and perch.\nCod\nThe cod is a popular saltwater fish that\ncomes from the cold, deep waters of the\nNorth Atlantic and the North Pacific\noceans.  The cod has been one of the most\nintensely fished species because it is easy to\npreserve for transport and storage.  It is part\nof the larger Gadidae family that also\nincludes the haddock, the silver hake, the\nwhiting, the black pollock, and the tomcod.\n“Scrod” is a term used to describe small cod\n(1 to 2 pounds), haddock, or pollock.  Cod\nFlounder\nThis very common flat fish is found in the\nwaters off nearly every part of the American\ncoastline.  Flounder is actually a large family\nof fish.  Sometimes flounder is referred to\nas sole or turbot, which are members of the\nflounder family.\nPreparation Tips\nFlounder can be purchased whole or\nfilleted and fresh or frozen.  Nearly any\ntype of cooking method can be used with\nsuccess.\nServing Suggestions\nSautéeing flounder in a skillet with a little\nsesame oil, ginger, and garlic is a quick and\ntasty way to cook this versatile fish.  Or,\nbraise the fish with shallots, fish broth, and\nwhite wine. \nHalibut\nOne of the largest saltwater flat fish, the\nhalibut is found in the cold waters of the\nNorth Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The fish\nusually weighs between 10 and 155 pounds.\nHowever, some halibut hauled in by\nfishermen have weighed more than 600\npounds.  Halibut is usually available in\nfillets or steaks.  When cooked, it has a firm,\nwhite flesh and  a mild flavor.\nPreparation Tips\nHalibut can be grilled, poached, baked,\nbroiled, or sautéed.  The Atlantic halibut,\nwhich is usually sold as steaks, is a bit more\nflavorful than the Pacific halibut, which is\nmore often available as fillets. \nServing Suggestions\nLight marinades, particularly those made\nfrom red or white wine, enhance halibut’s\nflavor without adding fat.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n313\nModerate-Fat Fish\nModerate-fat fish contain about 6 percent\nfat.  Their flesh ranges in color from white\nto beige and their taste from mild to muddy.\nCommon kinds of moderate-fat fish include\nstriped bass, catfish, swordfish, and tuna.\nStriped Bass\nThe striped bass was once abundant on\nboth the East and West coasts.  But it has\nbecome less common because of overfish-\ning and pollution.  Fish farms have become\none of the primary suppliers of this type of\nfish.\nPreparation Tips\nStriped bass has a pleasantly sweet flavor.\nIts sturdy fillets also lend themselves to a\nvariety of cooking methods.  It can be\nbaked, broiled, or steamed.\nPerch\nPerch is a freshwater fish, although some-\ntimes the rockfish, a saltwater fish, is\nreferred to by this name.  Common types\nof perch include the yellow perch and the\nwalleye, which is usually found in lakes,\nstreams, and rivers of the Great Lakes states.\nPreparation Tips\nAnother versatile fish, perch responds well\nto most traditional cooking methods.\nSautéed, steamed, baked, broiled, or fried,\nperch’s light, flaky, mild-tasting flesh\nresponds well.  One caveat:  perch in gen-\neral are very bony fish.\nServing Suggestions\nIn some regions of the United States, a wall-\neye sandwich is considered a delicacy.\nMarinades also enhance perch’s flavor.  And\nperch is excellent served baked or steamed. \nAn assortment \nof seafood\nServing Suggestions\nAn increasingly popular and healthful\nmethod to cook this fish is to drizzle a fillet\nwith a little olive oil, rub it with garlic, and\nthen grill until done.\nCatfish\nLong a Southern delicacy, this fish has\nbecome popular in all regions of the\ncountry.  Because of that, it is now often\nraised on farms instead of being gathered\nout of only rivers and lakes. \nPreparation Tips\nThe fish has a tough skin that must be\nremoved.  To do this, use a sharp knife and\ncut the skin just behind the gills.  Pull off\nthe skin with the fingers or a tweezers.\nCatfish can often be bought at stores cleaned\nand dressed.\n314\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nmoving through the water at up to 60 miles\nan hour, it is known for its power and mus-\ncular, scaleless body.  It usually weighs\nbetween 200 and 500 pounds and measures\nbetween 6 and 10 feet.\nPreparation Tips\nSwordfish is a rich-flavored fish with firm,\nmeaty flesh.  It is commonly purchased as\nfresh steaks and fillets, but it also can be found\nsmoked, frozen, or canned.  Because the flesh\nof swordfish is so firm, it can be prepared in\nalmost any manner, including sautéeing,\ngrilling, broiling, baking, and poaching.\nServing Suggestions\nThe rich flavor of swordfish stands up to\nsauces with pronounced flavor, such as\ntomato-caper or basil-garlic.  Swordfish is\nalso a good fish for grilled kabobs, another\nlow-fat, healthful way to serve fish.\nTuna\nThe tuna is a migratory fish found in \nthe temperate marine waters of the\nMediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and\nthe Indian Ocean.  The most common\nspecies include the bluefin, the albacore, the\nbonito, and the yellowfin tuna.  The tuna\nis a powerful fish that is very agile and a fast\nswimmer.  The larger bluefin tuna usually\nweighs between 200 and 400 pounds and\nmeasures between 3 and 7 feet.  The smaller\nbonito tuna rarely is more than 20 inches\nlong and weighs less than 5 pounds. \nTuna is also the most popular canned\nfish, in large part because of its low cost\nand versatility.  Several varieties are canned\nand packed in oil, but the fish packed in\nwater provides the same protein without\nthe extra fat and calories.  Canned tuna is\nsold as white tuna (albacore) and light tuna\n(bluefin and yellowfin).  The bonito is\nServing Suggestions\nCatfish is often served breaded or rolled in\ncornmeal or flour before it is fried.  It can\nbe deep fried in fat — not necessarily the\nhealthiest way to cook a fish already con-\nsidered higher in fat — until it is brown on\nboth sides.\nA healthier alternative is to poach cat-\nfish fillets in a chicken stock, white wine,\nand ginger.  This cooking method results\nin a pleasing dish that is lower in fat than\nthe traditional frying.\nSwordfish\nThere is only one species of swordfish,\nnamed for its unusually long and slender\nupper jaw.  It is found in temperate waters\nthroughout the world and is common in\nthe Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, Baltic Sea,\nand the Mediterranean Sea.  Capable of\nTuna salad sandwiches can \nbe an elegant luncheon.\nlabeled skipjack.  Tuna comes in three\ngrades, the best being solid or fancy (large\npieces), followed by chunk (smaller pieces)\nand flaked or grated (pieces).\nTuna is sold fresh and frozen as steaks,\nfillets, or pieces.  It is also available canned in\noil or in water and either salted or unsalted.\nPreparation Tips\nAll tuna has a distinctively rich-flavored flesh\nthat is firmly textured yet  flaky and tender.\nTuna flesh tends to be soft before cooking,\nbut it has a firm texture when cooked.  Tuna\nlends itself to several cooking methods, includ-\ning poaching, braising, grilling, or baking. \nServing Suggestions\nFresh tuna is especially good with spicy and\naromatic seasonings.  Marinate it in teriyaki\nsauce or in lemon juice with cracked black\npepper, then grill it.  Mixed with reduced-\nfat mayonnaise and seasonings, canned,\nwater-packed tuna makes an excellent fill-\ning for sandwiches.\nHigher-Fat Fish \nUp to 60 percent of calories of higher-fat\nfish may be derived from fat.  On average,\nthough, fish in this group have only about\n43 percent of calories from fat.  The good\nnews is that much of the fat that these fish\ncontain is omega-3 fatty acids, which many\nstudies suggest play a role in protecting\nagainst cardiovascular disease and enhanc-\ning brain function.  Flesh from these fish\nis darker and firmer and often has a stronger\nflavor.  Common types of higher-fat fish\ninclude mackerel, salmon, smelt, and trout. \nMackerel\nThis oily fish is related to the tuna and is\nan excellent source of omega-3 fatty acid.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n315\nTuna — Make sure the edges are opaque and the center slightly translucent with\nflakes just beginning to separate.  Let stand 3 to 4 minutes to finish cooking.\nMost mackerel caught is canned.  It is also\nsalted or smoked.\nPersons who live near the coasts, how-\never, may be able to purchase it fresh from\nfish markets.  If purchasing it fresh, look for\nfish that are firm and stiff.  Limpness is a key\nindicator that the fish is not fresh.  The fish\nshould be cooked and eaten as soon as pos-\nsible because it spoils quickly.  A bitter taste\nis a key sign that the fish has begun to spoil.\nFreezing the fish is not an option because\nthis seems to drain the flavor from this fish.\nPreparation Tips\nRemove the bones if filleting the fish.\nBecause of mackerel’s high fat content, try to\nuse methods that do not add fat.  Mackerel\ncan be baked, broiled, or poached. \nServing Suggestions\nTraditionally, mackerel is served with goose-\nberries. Other methods include using a\ncitrus marinade.  Mackerel can be used as\na substitute for canned tuna in many recipes.\nIt is also available smoked.\nSalmon\nSalmon can range from moderate- to high-\nfat, depending on the species.  There are\nseveral species of salmon in the Pacific\n(chinook, sockeye, coho, pink, chum) and\none in the Atlantic.  It has even been\nacclimated to freshwater.  A once threat-\nened species, it has survived thanks to\nsalmon farms and species management.\nSalmon are “anadromous,” meaning they\nmigrate from their saltwater habitat to\nspawn in fresh water.  The females of some\nspecies can lay up to 13,000 eggs.  The larger\nchinook salmon (also called king salmon)\nweighs between 30 and 40 pounds and mea-\nsures between 34 and 36 inches.  The small-\ner freshwater, or landlocked, salmon is short-\ner, between 8 and 24 inches, and it rarely\nweighs more than 13 pounds.\nSalmon is sold in many forms, including\nfresh, frozen, smoked, salted, dried, and\ncanned.  Fresh and frozen salmon can be\npurchased whole or as steaks, pieces, or\nfillets.  Whole salmon is usually sold\ncleaned, with the head on or removed.\n316\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nPreparation Tips\nSmelt is sold in a variety of ways, includ-\ning fresh, frozen, smoked, or dried.  Smelt\nis also commonly sold without the head or\ninnards.  Some people eat the bones, but\nit is easy to remove bones from this fish —\neither before eating it or while you are doing\nso, as you would a sardine.  The whole fish\ncan be consumed, however.\nServing Suggestions\nA common method of cooking is to coat\nsmelt with breading and then fry it in a\nskillet until cooked (about 2 to 3 minutes).\nSmelt also can be grilled. \nTrout\nThe trout is also part of the salmon family.\nIt is found mainly in the cold, fresh waters\nof lakes and rivers, but it also can make its\nhome in saltwater.  Like the salmon, trout\nthat live in the sea (the steelhead trout)\nreturn to freshwater to spawn.  A favorite of\nsports anglers, the trout was the first fish\nto be raised in captivity to forestall its\nextinction.  The most common species\ninclude the brown trout, the rainbow trout,\nthe lake trout, the brook trout, the arctic\nchar, and the common grayling.  The trout\nis a smaller fish and ranges in weight from\n1 1/2 to 13 pounds in the market and mea-\nsures up to 20 inches.\nPreparation Tips\nTrout has thin skin and minute scales, so\nscaling or skinning is not necessary.  It is\navailable whole or in fillets, fresh or frozen.\nTrout is also smoked, and a very small\nquantity is canned.  In general, trout has\ntender, flaky flesh with a mild flavor.  Its\ndelicate flavor varies slightly from one\nspecies to another, as does its color, which\ncan be white, pink, or reddish.\nonions, or it is added as a final touch to\nsandwiches, omelets, salads, and even dips\nand spreads.  Salmon roe is becoming more\npopular as “red caviar,” but real caviar\ncomes from sturgeon roe.  There are good\nsalmon cuts for almost every cooking\nmethod.  Fillets are delicious when grilled\nand served with a wedge of lemon.  Salmon\nis good served hot or cold with a variety\nof sauces.\nSmelt\nA relative of the salmon, this small, thin\nfish can be both a freshwater and a salt-\nwater fish.  Some species are found in the\nPacific and Atlantic oceans, and others\ninhabit freshwater sources.  The main types\nof smelt are American smelt, European\nsmelt, and capelin.  All three types grow to\nabout 7 to 8 inches long. \nSmoked salmon is usually sealed in plastic\nor frozen.  Salmon’s moist flesh is flaky and\ntender, and the flavor varies by species from\ndelicate and mild to rich and distinctive.\nSalmon spoils quickly because the flesh is\nfatty.  The chinook is the fattiest salmon,\nand the pink and chum are leaner.   \nPreparation Tips\nThe bones often included in canned salmon\nare edible and serve as a good source of cal-\ncium.  Make sure to crush the bones well.\nTo remove the small bones (called pin\nbones) from fresh fillets or steaks, use a\ntweezers  or pry them out of the flesh from\nthe side.\nServing Suggestions\nSmoked salmon (also called lox) is often\nserved on bagels with cream cheese (choose\nreduced-fat or fat-free cheeses), capers, and\nSalmon is an excellent source of\nheart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough it is often served fried, trout also\ncan be poached, baked, steamed, grilled,\nand broiled.  Whole trout is sometimes\nstuffed before being cooked.  Any season-\nings should be kept mild so as not to mask\ntrout’s delicate flavor. \nShellfish\nThe shellfish family is divided into two\nbasic categories:  crustaceans and mollusks.\nCrustaceans have elongated bodies and\njointed shells.  These include crab, lobster,\nand shrimp.  Mollusks are divided into three\ngroups:\nGastropods (or univalves) — These\nhave a single shell and single muscle.  An\nexample is the abalone.\nBivalves — Like the clam and oyster,\nbivalves have two shells hinged together by\na strong muscle.\nCephalopods — Examples include the\noctopus and the squid, which have tentacles\nand ink sacs.\nNutrition\nLike fish, shellfish are rich in protein yet\nlow in fat and calories.  Compared with\nother types of meat, however, the amount\nof cholesterol in most shellfish is about\nequivalent to that of a lean piece of beef or\na chicken breast with the skin removed.\nShrimp, squid, and crayfish, however, are\nvery high in cholesterol.  They have about\ntwice as much as lean beef, making them\nsomething to savor on occasion.\nSelection\nWhen selecting shellfish, remember that\nfresh is best.  The best way to guarantee\nfreshness is to buy live.  If your geographic\nlocation limits your opportunities for live\nHigh-Protein Foods\n317\nStorage\nOnce you leave the market, it is important\nto keep shellfish cool and refrigerate it as\nsoon as possible.  At home, shellfish should\nbe rinsed under cool, running water, placed\nin a container, and covered with wet paper\ntowels.  Use shellfish the day of purchase,\nif possible, or the next day. \nDo not seal live oysters, clams, or mussels\nin a plastic bag.  They need to breathe, so\nstore them covered with wet paper towels.\nUse them as soon as possible after purchase.\nShucked oysters that are refrigerated in the\noriginal container should stay fresh for a\nweek.  Plan to use commercially packaged\nfrozen seafood stored in your freezer within\n2 months for best flavor. \nshellfish, check out the freezer case for quick-\nfrozen items, which can be almost as good.\nJust as in picking out fish, use your nose to\nselect shellfish.  Shucked oysters and clams\nshould be plump and free of any sour aroma.\nFresh scallops should have a slightly sweet\naroma and, when packaged, be practically free\nof liquid.  Fresh shrimp are firm and have a\nmild, faintly sweet smell.  Crab or lobster\nshould move and not have any noticeable odor.\nNext, view the shellfish’s appearance.\nThe liquid packed with oysters should be\nclear, not pink or opaque.  Scallops, lobster,\nand shrimp flesh should be free of any black\nspots.  When you buy frozen shrimp, crab,\nor lobster tail, make sure any exposed meat\nis white, not yellow, and not dried out.\nFISH AND SHELLFISH ALLERGIES\nSeafood is a common source of food allergies.  About 250,000 Americans\nexperience allergic reactions to fish and shellfish each year.\nPeople with seafood allergies can have symptoms that range from mild to life-\nthreatening.  Even tiny amounts of fish substances can trigger a reaction in some\npeople.  What’s more, these allergies are rarely outgrown. \nExamples of shellfish that are common causes of allergic reactions include\nshrimp, crab, lobster, oyster, clam, scallop, mussel, and squid.  Fish that can \ntrigger allergic reactions include cod, salmon, trout, herring, sardine, bass, tuna,\nand orange roughy.\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction include nasal congestion, hives, itching,\nswelling, wheezing or shortness of breath, nausea, upset stomach, cramps, heart-\nburn, gas or diarrhea, light-headedness, or fainting. \nIf you suspect that you have any food allergies, see an allergist for a careful\nevaluation.  This generally includes a medical history, physical examination,\nand skin or blood testing.  If you are found to have a fish or shellfish allergy,\nthe best advice is to avoid fish or shellfish altogether.  That may be harder \nthan it sounds.  You may not be aware that seafood is an ingredient in a dish\nthat you are eating.  Be sure to check the labels of any product you buy.  \nIn addition, make sure that persons close to you are aware of the potential for\nthis kind of allergic reaction.  Many people with a food allergy wear medical\nalert bracelets. \nCherrystone clams.  American\nIndians called them “quahog.”\nSafety Issues\nPersons who eat shellfish  raw should beware.\nRaw shellfish may contain the organisms\nthat cause hepatitis and other diseases.\nCooking will kill any microorganisms in\nshellfish.  In addition, because shellfish filter\nlarge amounts of water each day, they may\ncontain residual amounts of any pollutants\nin the water near them.  Concerns about\npotentially harmful chemicals are also a\nconcern about shellfish.  Women who are\npregnant or thinking about having a child\nshould check with their physician about\nhow much shellfish they should eat.\nAnother important safety note is that\nshellfish are a common trigger of allergic\nreactions in some people (see sidebar:  Fish\nand Shellfish Allergies, page 317).\nAbalone\nAbalone is actually a large snail that lives\nin the sea.  It has a single shell and a tough,\nmuscular “foot” with which it clings tena-\nciously to rocks as it grazes on seaweed.\nThe edible portion is this foot.\nAbalone is found primarily along the\ncoastlines of California, Mexico, and Japan.\nFour of California’s seven species constitute\nmost of the commercial catch.  From largest\nto smallest are red, pink, green, and black\nabalone, with red reaching a legal market size\nat 7 3/4 inches and black at 5 3/4 inches.\nBlack abalone is the most affordable wild\nspecies today.  Its meat is tougher and requires\nmore pounding than the other species, but\nit has an excellent sweet flavor.  It is an excel-\nlent source of protein and a good source of\niron, magnesium, and phosphorus.\nAbalone is known by many names:\n“ormer” in the English Channel, “awabi”\nin Japan, “muttonfish” in Australia, and\n“paua” in New Zealand.  Its iridescent shell\nis a source of mother-of-pearl.\n318\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nThe quahog (pronounced CO-hog) is\na hard-shell species from the East Coast\nand is the largest of Eastern clams (1 1/2 to\n6 inches across).  Quahog is also a family\nname for hard-shell clams that can include\ncherrystones (less than 3 inches) and lit-\ntlenecks (2 to 2 1/2 inches).  Also popular\nin the East are soft-shell clams called steam-\ners.  As the name indicates, they are great\nfor steaming.  On the West Coast, soft-\nshell Pacific geoducks (pronounced GOO-\ney-ducks) weigh between 2 and 4 pounds,\nalthough they can be 3 feet long and up\nto 5 pounds.  They have an enormous\nsiphon that extends from the shell; this is\noften sliced for sushi because it is also quite\nsweet.\nAs with all filter feeders, clams some-\ntimes ingest toxic levels of planktonic\nmicroorganisms during a condition called\nPreparation\nLike all fresh shellfish, abalone should be\nalive when purchased — it will move when\nit is touched — and smell sweet, not fishy.\nChoose those that are relatively small for\nbest flavor.  Refrigerate abalone immedi-\nately and cook within a day.  Abalone is\nalso sold canned (once opened, refrigerate,\ncovered with water in a sealed container,\nfor up to 5 days), dried (store tightly\nwrapped in a cool, dry place indefinitely),\nand frozen (store for up to 3 months).\nWidely used in Chinese and Japanese\ncooking, abalone must be washed first to\nremove sand that may be caught in the flesh.\nAbalone must be pounded before cooking\nto make it tender, because the edible portion\nis a muscle.  Use a mallet to flatten the meat\nto 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness.  Overcooking\nabalone can toughen it.  Sauté abalone\nbriefly, for not more than 20 to 30 seconds\nper side.  Prevent abalone from curling dur-\ning cooking by scoring the meat at 1/2-inch\nintervals with a sharp knife. \nServing Suggestions\nAbalone is an  excellent addition to appe-\ntizers and salads.  Tough or overcooked\nabalone can be added to chowders or soups.\nClam\nClams are double-hinged mollusks that fall\ninto two broad categories — hard shell and\nsoft shell.  The parts eaten are the muscles\nclams use to close their shells, although the\nsiphon (the valve used to intake water) and\nthe foot (which nudges this creature along\non the ocean’s floor) are also edible.  Clams\ngenerally are chewy and have a mild, even\nsweet, flavor.  Taste and characteristics vary\nby the type of clam and its size.  All are a\nlean seafood choice and an excellent  source\nof vitamin B12 and iron.\nred tide and also can become contaminated\nfrom pollution.\nWhen buying hard-shell clams such as\nthe littleneck or cherrystone (other vari-\neties include chowder, pismo, or butter\nclams), make sure the shells are tightly\nclosed.  If a shell is slightly open, tap it light-\nly.  If it does not snap shut, the clam is dead\nand should be discarded.  The shells should\nbe whole, not broken or cracked.  To test\na soft-shell clam, such as geoducks or steam-\ners (another popular variety is razor clams),\nlightly touch the neck; if it moves, it is alive. \nStore live clams in an open container\ncovered with a moist cloth for up to 2 days\nin the refrigerator.  Shucked clams should\nbe plump and the liquor (liquid) sur-\nrounding them clear.  Store shucked clams\nin their liquor in the refrigerator for up to\n3 days and in the freezer for up to 3\nmonths.  If there is not enough liquor to\ncover the shucked clams, make your own\nby dissolving 1/2 teaspoon salt in 1 cup\nwater. \nPreparation Tips\nGet rid of sand by soaking live clams in\ncold, salted water (use 1/3 cup salt per\ngallon water) for an hour.  Sand also can\nbe removed by covering the clams with\nwater, then sprinkling liberally with corn-\nmeal and letting stand for about 3 hours.\nAny clams that are floating after these two\nmethods should be discarded.\nLive clams should be well scrubbed\nunder cold, running water.  Clams are\nmuch easier to open if they are put into\nthe freezer in a single layer for 30 to 45\nminutes.  A quicker method for relaxing\nclams so that they are easier to open is to\ndrop a few at a time into boiling water.\nRetrieve with a slotted spoon after 15\nseconds and open.  Clams also can be\nmicrowaved until they open.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n319\nplentiful.  Soft-shell crabs are not a distinct\nvariety of crabs.  Rather, they are crabs that\nhave shed their hard outer shell.  Before\ngrowing a new shell, these crabs (usually a\nvariety called blue crabs) have a 6-hour\nwindow during which they have a soft shell.\nThis window can be extended if the crus-\ntaceans are removed from water.  The\nbenefit of a soft-shell crab is that it can be\neaten whole without bothering with a pesky,\nrigid exterior.  Alaskan king crab is anoth-\ner term crab buyers may encounter.  Meat\nfrom this large crab species is frozen soon\nafter the catch.  Then, the sweet, meaty\nflesh is frozen so it can be shipped to far-\nflung locations. \nCrab is a lean source of protein and an\nexcellent source of  vitamin B12.\nPreparation Tips\nCrab is sold whole, cooked or alive.  Choose\nlive crabs that are active and heavy for their\nsize.  Hard-shell varieties should not have\nsoftening shells.  Refrigerate live crabs\ncovered with a damp towel until just before\nServing Suggestions\nClams should be cooked at low heat to\nprevent toughening.  Clams cooked in their\nshells are done just when their shells open.\nSoft-shell clams are best for this method.\nUse only fresh or frozen clams for soups and\nstews, because the texture of canned clams is\ntoo soft for long-cooking dishes.  Clams are\noften added to soups and stews.  A famous\ndish in which they are featured is clam\nchowder.  When adding clams to this type of\ndish, do so at the last minute so they do not\nlose their texture.  Clams are also excellent\nadditions to dips, salads, and quiches.\nCrab\nThere are dozens of different crabs on the\nmarket today, varying widely in size and\nshape.  Therefore, it is important to know\nwhat kind of crab you are buying before\nbringing it home.\nCrabs have 10 legs, the front 2 of which\nhave pincers.  There are freshwater and salt-\nwater crabs.

Live crabs should be used the day\nthey are purchased.\nCooked whole crabs and crabmeat\nshould have a fresh, sweet smell.  Cooked\ncrab is available in whole pieces (lump white\nmeat from the body) or in smaller pieces\n(flaked light and dark meat from the body\nand legs).\nFor ease of use, consider using canned\ncrabmeat.  Or, if you prefer, choose pas-\nteurized crabmeat, which has been heated\nin cans but has not been subjected to the\nhigher temperatures of the canning process.\nFor this reason, pasteurized crabmeat should\nbe stored unopened in the refrigerator no\nlonger than 6 months.  Use it quickly after\nopening.  Always use your fingers to pick\nover crabmeat, fresh or canned, to make\nsure there are not tiny pieces of hidden shell.\nRefrigerate leftover cooked crabmeat, tight-\nly covered, for not more than 2 days. \nServing Suggestions\nCrabmeat has a tender, flaky texture and a\ndelicate, sweet flavor.  For the best possible\nflavor, choose live crabs.  If only cooked crab\nis available, add it to hot dishes during the last\nminutes of cooking and cook just until hot.\nCrabs can be cooked in a variety of low-\nfat ways, including steaming and broiling or\nin broth-based soups and gumbos.  Crab\ncakes, traditionally held together with may-\nonnaise and bread crumbs, are leaving the\nconfines of New England for the rest of the\nstates.  A lower-fat version uses egg whites\nin place of mayonnaise.  Instead of floating\ncrabs  in a pan filled with oil, try dusting\nthem with flour and reducing the amount\nof oil you use.  \nLobster\nOne of the largest crustaceans, lobster has\na jointed body and limbs covered with a\n320\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nLobsters can be prepared in a variety of\nways, including steaming, broiling, and\ngrilling.  Another common preparation\nmethod is boiling.  A general rule for cook-\ning lobster with any method is to allow 12\nminutes per pound.  The lobster is done as\nsoon as its shell becomes red or the meat turns\nopaque.  A sign that a lobster has been over-\ncooked is that its meat is stringy and tough. \nServing Suggestions\nThe firm flesh and pleasant flavor of lobster\nmake it a versatile seafood.  It can be eaten\nplain, seasoned with lemon juice, garlic, and\na drizzle of butter, or added to pâtés, salads,\nor sauces.  Lobster bisque, essentially a cream-\nbased lobster stew, is a classic lobster dish\nenjoyed by diners the world over.  Because \nit is high in calories and fat, it should be\nsavored on special occasions.  Lobster meat\nalso can be mixed with curry sauce.  It is also\nan elegant, tasteful addition when added to\nsalad greens  and sprinkled with lemon juice\nor a spicy lower-fat vinaigrette. \nMussels\nPerhaps it is the dark shell that accounts\nfor its foreboding reputation.  Perhaps it is\nthe name, which makes it sound too much\nlike a stringy, tough muscle.  Whatever the\ncase, mussels do not have the audience in\nthe United States that other forms of\nseafood do, even though people throughout\nthe world have been eating them for more\nthan 20,000 years.\nAlthough there are dozens of mussel\nspecies, only two reach American markets\nwith any regularity.  The blue mussel (which\nis actually dark blue to black) and the blue-\ngreen mussel can be used in recipes inter-\nchangeably, but the blue-green type from\nNew Zealand is larger and more expensive.\nThe blue mussel is most abundant, found\nhard shell.  The coveted edible portion of\nthe lobster is generally the sweet flesh inside\nits tail, and sometimes in its claws.  Its liver\n(tomalley) and eggs (coral) also can be\neaten.  Lobsters are prized by diners for\ntheir firm flesh and flavorful, yet not over-\npowering, taste.\nLobsters can be divided into two\ngroups: large, clawed (American) lobsters\nand spiny (rock) lobsters.  American lob-\nsters hail from around Maine, whereas rock\nlobsters can be caught in the waters off the\nsoutheastern United States and in the\nPacific.  American lobsters boast claws with\nyet more meat, but only the tails of spiny\nlobsters are eaten.  These tails are often sold\nfrozen throughout the United States.  The\nmeat is more dense and fibrous than that\nof the American lobster.  It lacks some of\nthat characteristic sweetness, but the tails\nare far more inexpensive than buying a\nwhole American lobster.\nLobster is an excellent source of zinc.  \nPreparation Tips\nWhen selecting a live lobster, look for an\nactive one whose tail curls under its body\nwhen lifted.  If lobsters have been stored\non ice, they may be sluggish.  Bacteria form\nquickly in a dead lobster, so it is important\nthat you purchase it live.  Live lobsters will\ndie quickly, so they must be kept in sea-\nwater, wrapped in a wet cloth, or wrapped\nin several sheets of wet newspapers.  Use\nthese methods for only a few hours (24 hours\nat most), then cook the lobster.  It is best\nto cook lobster the same day you buy it. \nWhole, cooked lobsters should have their\ntails curled tightly under their bodies, a sign\nthey were alive when cooked. Cooked lobster\nmeat should be sweet-smelling and snow-\nwhite.  Frozen tails should be in an untorn\npackage with no sign of frost; the visible meat\nshould be free of dry-looking spots.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n321\nalong the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and\nPacific coasts.  It is usually 2 to 3 inches in\nlength.\nMany mussels are being cultivated\ninstead of harvested because of the dangers\nposed by microscopic organisms (of red tide\nnotoriety) that make mussels unsafe to eat\nduring the spring and summer months. \nWhen choosing mussels, make sure they\nare still alive by tapping on their shells.  If\nthey slam shut, they are still alive.  Those\nwith tightly closed shells also are a good\nchoice.  In general, smaller mussels are more\ntender.  Cultivated mussels are usually\nsmaller, and they also lack some of the sand\nand grit of harvested mussels.  Choose\nshucked mussels that are plump and have\na clear liquor (liquid).  Or, opt for  plain\nand smoked mussels packed in oil. \nStore live mussels in a single layer on a\ntray in the refrigerator covered only with a\ndamp towel or wet newspapers for up to 2\ndays.  Store shucked mussels in the refrig-\nerator up to 3 days.  They should be covered\ncompletely with their liquor (liquid).  If\nyou need more liquor, combine 1 cup water\nwith 1/2 teaspoon salt and pour this brine\nover the mussels to cover.\nPreparation Tips\nBefore cooking, use a stiff brush to scrub\nmussels under cold, running water.  Pull\nout the dark threads (beard) that protrude\nfrom the shell.  Mussels die when debeard-\ned, the term given for removal of these\nthreads,  so do not remove the dark threads\nuntil just before cooking.  Get rid of sand\nby soaking mussels in cold, salted water\n(use 1/3 cup salt per gallon of water) for 1\nhour.  Like all shellfish, mussels should be\ncooked gently to prevent toughening.\nMussels cooked in their shells are done\nwhen their shells pop open.  Discard any\nwith unopened shells.\nFresh octopus already dressed and ready\nfor dishes can be found in many supermar-\nkets and specialty fish markets.  Frozen,\nsmoked, and canned octopus is also avail-\nable.  Shop for octopus the same way you\nshop for fish, using your nose as a guide.\nOctopus should smell fresh, not fishy, and if\nit has eyes, they should be bright, not cloudy.\nAs with most aquatic species, octupus that\nis smaller is younger and more tender.  Both\nthe body and all of the tentacles are edible.\nThe ink sac contains an edible black liquid\nthat can be used to color and flavor foods\nsuch as pasta, soups, and stews.\nPreparation Tips\nAlways rinse octopus well before cooking.\nAlthough many cooks believe that an octo-\npus must be tenderized before cooking (such\nas by beating it with a mallet or even hurl-\ning it against a hard surface), octopus can\nsimply be cooked until it is tender.  Cooking\ntime varies by size.  Generally, an octopus\nthat weighs more than 4 pounds should\nServing Suggestions\nAn elegant way to serve them is simple:  boil\nthem.  Add garlic, onion, a splash of olive\noil, and white wine to the water while cook-\ning — generally, about 8 to 10 minutes.\nSaffron also provides an excellent flavor.\nServe with French bread.  This can be broken\ninto pieces to be used to soak up the\nflavorful broth you created while cooking\nthe mussels.  A general rule: about 1 pound\nof mussels per person is needed.\nOctopus\nAlthough \npopular \nin \nJapan \nand\nMediterranean countries, the octopus in\nNorth America is more likely to be a villain\nof  “scary” movies than the star of a seafood\nmeal.  But octopus is relatively inexpensive\nand versatile, and it provides highly flavor-\nful, meaty (albeit sometimes chewy) chunks.\nMost octopuses weigh only about 3 pounds\nand reach a size of only 1 to 2 feet before\nbeing caught for food. \nMussels steamed with\nwhite wine and onion\n322\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nsimmer for about 45 minutes.  This seafood\ncan be cooked in a variety of ways, includ-\ning grilling, frying, steaming, and poaching.\nServing Suggestions\nOctopus is an excellent addition to seafood\nstews and soups, adding an unusual texture\nto the dish.  Its flavor is enhanced by garlic,\ntomatoes, red wine, and soy sauce.\nOysters\nOysters have many different names, which\nare clues to where they come from and their\nvaried taste and appearance.  The marine\nplants they feed on account for these differ-\nences.  The hard, rough, gray shell contains\nmeat that can vary in color from creamy\nbeige to pale gray, in flavor from salty to\nbland, and in texture from tender to firm. \nOysters are rich in zinc, iron, copper,\nand vitamin B12.  Interestingly, it is oysters’\nrelatively high zinc content that gave them\ntheir reputation as an aphrodisiac when\neaten raw.  \nPurchase the freshest oysters you can\nfind.  Gauge freshness by tapping on the\noyster shells with your fingernail.  If they\nsnap shut quickly or are already shut tightly,\nthey are fresh.  In general, smaller oysters\nwill be more tender than larger ones.  Buy\nshucked oysters of uniform size and color\nencased in a clear liquor (liquid). \nYou may store oysters for up to 3 days\nin the refrigerator using the same method as\nfor mussels, but the sooner you use them,\nthe better.  If any shells open during stor-\nage, tap them.  If they do not close, throw\nthem out.  Store shucked oysters, covered\nby their liquor, for up to 2 days in the refrig-\nerator and up to 3 months in the freezer.  If\nthere is not enough liquor to cover the\nshucked oysters, make your own by dis-\nsolving 1/2 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of water.  \nPreparation Tips\nScrub live oysters under cold, running water\nbefore opening.  Oyster knives specially\ndesigned for removing the flesh from the\nshells — which can be a tricky operation —\nare available at cooking supply stores.  Oysters\nand other bivalves will open more easily if\nthey are heated briefly — such as by steam-\ning them for several seconds or microwav-\ning them for a minute. \nServing Suggestions\nWhen fresh and safely available, raw oysters\nare a unique treat.  “Raw bars” serve the tra-\nditional “shooter,” a New Orleans-inspired\nhot sauce covering a raw oyster.  If you serve\nthem raw, keep them chilled (and prevent\nthe growth of microorganisms) by putting\nthem on a bed of ice. \nOysters in the shell also can be cooked\nin numerous ways:  baked, steamed, or\ngrilled.  Oysters Rockefeller, a hot hors\nd’oeuvre that is baked and broiled with a\nspinach topping, is a traditional, elegant\nfavorite.  Use shucked oysters in dressings\nor poultry stuffings.  Oyster stew is often\nmade with only heavy cream, oysters, and\nbutter, but a healthier alternative can be\ncreated with evaporated milk and added\nvegetables, such as potatoes, pearl onions,\ncarrots, or mushrooms. \nScallops\nLike clams and oysters, scallops are bivalves\n(two-shelled mollusks).  Scallops propel them-\nselves along the ocean floor by clapping their\nshells together using a well-developed muscle\ncalled the eye, the part of the scallopthat is eaten.\nIf you avoid fish and other types of\nshellfish, you may still like scallops because\nits eye is firmer than most shellfish meat\nand its flavor is mild yet sweet.  Scallops\nare rich in vitamin B12 and potassium.\nScallops are classified in two broad\ngroups: bay scallops and sea scallops.  Bay\nscallops, with meat about 1/2 inch in diam-\neter, are sweeter, more succulent, and more\nexpensive.  Sea scallops, with meat about\n1 1/2 inches in diameter, are more widely\navailable.  A third type is the calico scallop,\na small sea scallop from Florida, but it is\noften sold as bay scallops.  These scallops\nhave to be steamed to be opened, so they\nare partially cooked when sold.  They are\nthe cheapest of the scallops.\nBecause scallops cannot close their shells\ntightly, they spoil quickly out of water, and\nthey are usually shucked at sea.  The muscle\nis iced and the rest discarded.  Sometimes\nthe coral-colored roe is left attached to be\neaten with the muscle as a delicacy.\nLook for scallops with a sweet smell and\na fresh, moist sheen.  Avoid any with a\nstrong sulfur odor.  Scallops can range in\ncolor from pale beige to creamy to orange.\nAvoid those that are stark white, a sign that\nthey have been soaked in water as a marketing\nploy to increase the weight.  Refrigerate\nshucked scallops immediately after purchase\nand use within 1 to 2 days.\nPreparation Tips\nScallops must be opened like oysters if pur-\nchased unshucked.  Some sea scallops still\nhave a small piece of tough connective tis-\nsue attached to one side, which should be\npulled off and discarded.  Scallops need\nonly brief cooking.  Overcooking or reheat-\ning cooked scallops will toughen them.  The\nroe, if attached, can be cooked right along\nwith the muscle.  Large scallops should be\nsliced into smaller pieces.\nServing Suggestions\nScallops are suitable for a variety of prepa-\nration methods, including sautéeing, grilling,\nbroiling, and poaching.  They also are used\nHigh-Protein Foods\n323\nin soups, stews, and salads.  Scallops cook\nvery quickly — about 1 to 3 minutes —\nand no scallop needs to cook longer than 6\nto 8 minutes, no matter how large. \nShrimp\nShrimp is the most widely consumed\nseafood worldwide, and it is the second\nmost popular in the United States, after\ntuna.  The harvest of both wild and farmed\nshrimp is increasing rapidly to keep pace\nwith the soaring demand for this crustacean.\nIt has become popular internationally\nbecause its sweet, mild, and yet distinct\nflavor is similar to that of lobster, but it is\neasier to cook and costs half as much.\nAlthough hundreds of species are\ncaught, shrimp generally can be classified\nby origin — either warm water or cold\nwater.  Cold-water varieties — such as the\nwell-known small, pink, peeled shrimp —\ntend to be sweeter than the larger shrimp,\nwhich typically develop in warmer waters.\nThese larger varieties  are often sold\nuncooked and unpeeled under the name\n“prawns,” but the name can be used for\nshrimp of any size.\nThe names of shrimp can be confus-\ning.  Many varieties of shrimp are named\nafter a color (white, pink, brown), but white\nshrimp are not necessarily white.  They may\nlook pink, brown, or gray.  Confounding\nthe problem, most shrimp shells change\ncolor when cooked. \nShrimp are marketed according to size\n(number per pound), but market terms vary\ngreatly.  Because shrimp freeze well, most,\neven those classified as “fresh” in the super-\nmarket, have been frozen at some point.\nNeither taste nor texture suffers much.\nShrimp is sold shelled or unshelled, raw\nor cooked, and fresh or frozen.  Shrimp also\ncan be bought breaded or stuffed or as a\ncold or even frozen.  Shrimp are also usually\ndeveined, although this is not necessary\nbefore eating small to medium-sized\nshrimp.  To devein a shrimp, cut into the\nshrimp lengthwise with a sharp knife.  Then\nuse the knife to remove the dark vein —\nwhich is actually the intestine that runs\ndown its back. \nAlthough there are slight differences in\ntexture and flavor, shrimp of various sizes\n(except the miniatures) can usually be sub-\nstituted for each other.\nAs with all shellfish, shrimp should be\ncooked briefly or it becomes tough and\nrubbery.  Cook only until the flesh turns\nopaque.  To test, cut a shrimp in half, and\ncheck whether the flesh has turned from\ntranslucent to opaque.  Whole shrimp\nshould just begin to curl. If the shells are\non, they should turn pink. \nspread for crackers or bread.  Dried shrimp\nand shrimp paste can be found in Asian\ngrocery stores.\nPreparation Tips\nChoose raw, shelled shrimp that are firm,\nmoist, and translucent.  Avoid any shrimp\nthat smells like ammonia.  Unshelled shrimp\nshould have shiny, firm shells.  Avoid those\nwith black spots and those with yellow or\ngritty shells, which result from a bleaching\nprocess to remove the spots. \nBefore storing fresh, uncooked shrimp,\nrinse them well under cold, running water\nand drain thoroughly.  Refrigerate, tightly\ncovered, for up to 2 days.\nShrimp are usually shelled before they\nare eaten, which is easily accomplished by\npeeling back the head first, then the rest of\nthe shell.  Shelling is easier when shrimp are\nFor a tasty and healthful change, grill scallops and serve with a\nvariety of vegetables (grilled zucchini, white beans, and scallions).\n324\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nwhere they can soften in less than an hour.\nSoaking shortens cooking time by 30\nminutes to up to an hour.  It also has the\nadvantage of reducing flatulence (intestinal\ngas) by making them more digestible.\nLegumes that are sold as “quick-cook-\ning” have been presoaked and redried before\npackaging and thus do not need to be soaked. \nWhen several types of legumes are\nrequired for a dish, it is best to cook each\ntype separately because it is difficult to cook\nthem uniformly together.\nNutrition\nLegumes are great sources of nutrition\nbecause they carry the embryonic necessi-\nties for starting a new plant.  They are high\nin protein, folic acid, potassium, iron, mag-\nnesium, and phytochemicals (see the\nAppendix:  Phytochemical Contents of\nSelected Foods, page 484).  Legumes are\nnot complete proteins like meats (soybeans\nare an exception), but they can be paired\nwith complementary foods, such as grains,\nto ensure a meal provides a complete source\nof amino acids for building proteins.  And\nunlike meat, they are low in fat, high in\nfiber, and inexpensive. \nBecause of their low cost, legumes were\nonce considered “poor man’s meat.”  But\nwith the increased popularity of ethnic\ncuisines (such as Mexican, Chinese, and\nMediterranean), the growing popularity of\nvegetarianism, and the recognized health\nbenefits of legumes, they have shed this\noutdated perception.\nSelection\nThere are expensive “designer beans,” but\nmost legumes are widely available at grocery\nstores and are an inexpensive addition to\nmeals.  Look for a uniform appearance to\nthe product you are buying.  Legumes should\nalso have a deep, almost glossy color.  Avoid\nMost legumes are annual plants that can\ngrow as vines or bushes.  The shape, size, and\ncolor of the stems, leaves, and flowers differ\naccording to species.  After fertilization of\nthe flowers, pods develop.  These contain\nseeds of varying sizes, shapes, and colors.\nThe plants of the legume family share\ntwo main features.  First, they produce sin-\ngle-chambered, flattened seedpods with\nseeds inside.  Either the pod or the seeds\ninside (or both) are eaten. \nA second common feature is that\nlegumes are capable of an important bio-\nlogical process called nitrogen fixation,\nwhich actually enriches or naturally fertil-\nizes the soil in which the plants grow.\nAccordingly, legumes (such as soybeans and\nalfalfa) are grown in rotation with other\ncrops (such as corn) that only take nutri-\nents from the soil. \nLegumes are sold in many forms.  They\nare available as whole fresh pods, such as\ngreen beans, and in dried pods, such as the\ntamarind.  Lima beans are examples of\nlegumes available as fresh seeds, and dried\nseeds include black-eyed peas.  There are\nalso seed sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts and\nsoybean sprouts.  Although technically con-\nsidered legumes, tamarind and jicama are\ntreated as a fruit and vegetable, respectively.\nLegumes are generally easy to prepare\nand can be either the main entrée or the\nside dish.  Generally, dried legumes are rehy-\ndrated before cooking, which is done by\nsoaking them in water for about 6 to\n8 hours.  An alternative and\nshorter method is to put\nthem in a pressure\ncooker or to simmer\nthem in a pan\nServing Suggestions\nOne reason for the popularity of shrimp is\nits versatility.  Name a cooking technique,\nand you probably will be able to find a\nshrimp recipe for it.  Shrimp is served cold\nin shrimp cocktail.  It can be grilled, boiled,\nbroiled, roasted, curried, or stir-fried.  It\ngoes well with pasta and rice. It is also an\nexcellent ingredient in soups and can be\nused interchangeably with other shellfish\nin recipes.  Garlic is a seasoning that par-\nticularly complements shrimp’s flavor.  The\ntwo are used together in well-known dishes\nsuch as shrimp scampi.\nLegumes\nLegumes have historically been part of\nmeals throughout the world.  There is\nabundant evidence that the peanut and lima\nbean have been used for centuries in South\nAmerica.  Soybeans and mung beans,\namong others, have been a key part of Asian\ndishes throughout history.  The Middle\nEast is the origin of broad beans, chickpeas,\nand lentils.  Because of this, cooking with\nlegumes can provide an education and an\nintroduction to international cuisine.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n325\nbuying products that are cracked, broken,\ndry-looking, or faded.  These are most likely\nto have been on the shelf for a while.\nStorage\nDried legumes are easily stored.  Putting\nthem in a covered container or closed plastic\nbag can help maintain their freshness and\nextend their shelf life.\nLegumes that are commonly used are\ndescribed on the following pages.\nAlfalfa\nAlso known as lucerne, alfalfa is the common\nname of a legume that once was thought of\nonly as animal feed.  The plant is believed to\nhave originated in southwestern Asia around\nthe area of Asia Minor and the Caucasus\nMountains.  Spanish explorers brought the\nplant to the Americas, where, in the United\nStates, it was first established as a crop in\nCalifornia in the 1850s. \nAlfalfa grows up to 5 feet in height and\nbears spiral-shaped pods containing six to\neight small brown or yellow seeds.  Because\nthe roots are capable of extending as much\nas 30 feet into the soil, the alfalfa plant can\nreach stores of water and nutrients that\nallow it to survive periods of extreme\ndrought.\nAlfalfa became part of the human diet\non a wide scale in the 1970s, when many\npeople began to enjoy alfalfa sprouts.  Today,\nalfalfa sprouts are sold in most grocery stores. \nPreparation Tips\nAlfalfa sprouts should be washed thoroughly\nbefore they are eaten.  Buy sprouts that look\nhealthy and green.  Avoid those that are\noff-color, smell moldy, or look soggy.  They\ncan be kept for about a week in the refrig-\nerator (see sidebar:  Is It Safe to Eat Raw\nSprouts? this page).\nremoved by blanching (plunging the beans\ninto boiling water briefly, then running them\nunder cold water).  This process loosens the\nskin, which can then be easily removed.\nBuying beans that are split and dried will\nhelp the beans cook faster and eliminate the\nneed to get rid of the tough outer skin.\nServing Suggestions\nUsually used raw, alfalfa sprouts can be\nadded to salads, sandwiches, omelets, tacos,\nand hors d’oeuvres.  They also can be used\nto garnish soups and stews.  In parts of\nChina and Russia, the plant’s tender, young\nleaves are eaten as a vegetable.\nBroad Beans (Fava Beans)\nCommonly called fava beans in the United\nStates, broad beans are also known as haba,\nEnglish, Windsor, tick, cold, horse, or field\nbeans.  Broad beans get their name from\nthe seeds, which are large and flat and look\nlike very large lima beans.  The seeds range\nin length from about a half inch to 2 inches.\nThey can also vary in color from white,\ngreen, buff, brown, and purple to black.\nBroad beans are an excellent source of\nnutrition.  They are rich in fiber, folic acid,\npotassium, magnesium, and thiamin, to\nname just a few nutrients.\nPreparation Tips\nBroad beans are commonly available dried\nor precooked in cans, although they can\nsometimes be found fresh in the pod.  The\nbeans have a very tough skin that can be\nSprouting at home\nIS IT SAFE TO EAT RAW SPROUTS?\nAll plant sprouts that are eaten raw\nmay pose a health risk.  The reason,\naccording to the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration, is that they\ncould be contaminated with food-\nborne pathogens such as the\nSalmonella bacterium or another\nharmful bacterium, Escherichia (E.)\ncoli.  Pregnant women, children, the\nelderly, and persons with compromised\nimmune systems (such as people\nwith cancer) may be harmed by\ningesting sprouts.\nIf you are one of the people in\nthese groups, avoiding sprouts when\neating out is advised.  However, even\nthe seeds that are used for sprouts that\nare grown at home can be contaminated.  \n326\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nServing Suggestions\nBroad beans are starchy and strong-flavored\nand are great puréed or mashed and in salads.\nIn Italy, broad beans are combined with other\nstrong-flavored ingredients, and in France\nthey are considered a good cocktail food. \nA simple but elegant serving suggestion\nis to add a little butter to the cooked beans\nand a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste and\nthen serve topped with chopped parsley.\nChickpeas (Garbanzo Beans)\nBotanical and archeological evidence reveals\nthat chickpea plants were first domesticat-\ned in the Middle East in ancient times.\nToday, however, India supplies 80 to 90\npercent of the world’s supply of chickpeas. \nThe many names that chickpeas go by\nare a nod to the many regions of the world\nwhere they are now grown and eaten.  In\nIndia, they are referred to as Bengal gram.\nIn Spanish-speaking countries, they are gar-\nbanzo.  The Arab world refers to them as\nhamaz (or hummus), and in Ethiopia they\nare called shimbra.\nThe plants grow in tropical to temperate\nregions and reach about 2 feet in height.\nPlants bear inflated inch-long pods enclos-\ning one or two irregularly shaped seeds.\nMiddle East, they are mashed and used as the\nmain ingredient in hummus, a thick sauce\nmade with lemon juice, olive oil, and sesame\nseed paste.  Hummus is becoming a popular\ndish in the United States.  Falafel, a Middle\nEastern croquette, is another dish that draws\non the chickpea as its main ingredient.  In the\nMediterranean region, chickpeas are added\nto Spanish stews and Italian minestrone soups. \nCommon Beans\nBeans provide a good source of dietary fiber.\nBeans or peas, eaten together or at separate\nmeals, form a high-quality protein essen-\ntially equivalent to that from animal sources.\n(For more information on green beans, also\nknown as snap or string beans, see page 257.)\nCommon beans originated in Central\nAmerica, where archaeological remains of\nthese beans, found in association with the\nremains of maize and squash, have been\ncarbon dated to more than 7,000 years of\nexistence.  Columbus and subsequent\nSpanish and Portuguese explorers carried\nbeans back to Europe and eventually intro-\nduced them throughout Asia and Africa. \nA few of the most familiar beans are\ndescribed here.\nBlack Beans\nMany people have become acquainted with\nblack beans after eating at Mexican restau-\nrants, where they are served boiled or refried.\nAlso known as turtle beans, black beans are\na common part of the cuisine throughout\nCentral and South America, the Caribbean,\nand the southern United States.  As their name\nindicates, they have a completely black skin.\nThey have a mild, somewhat sweet taste.\nBlack beans are an excellent source of\nfolate and a good source of iron, magnesium,\nphosphorus, potassium, and thiamin.\nThe seeds are about one-quarter to one-half\nan inch in diameter and can be buff-col-\nored, yellow, brown, black, or green.  The\nplant’s young, green pods and sprouts can\nalso be eaten.\nLike many legumes, chickpeas are an\nexcellent source of fiber.  In addition, they\nare a good source of magnesium.\nPreparation Tips\nChickpeas are available at most grocery stores\nboth canned and dried.  They can be eaten\nfresh, fried, roasted, or boiled.  Generally,\nchickpeas should be soaked overnight before\ncooking, which is usually done by boiling\nthem.  Dried chickpeas may take as long as\n2 hours before they are soft and ready to eat.\nA pressure cooker is also an option and can\nreduce cooking time by half.\nServing Suggestions\nChickpeas have a mild, slightly nutty flavor\nand a firm texture.  They can be used in appe-\ntizers, salads, soups, or main dishes.  Flour\nmade from ground chickpeas can be made\ninto breads or used as batter for deep-fat fry-\ning.  They also can be combined with pasta\nor simply served by themselves.  Sometimes\nthey are served roasted and salted like peanuts.\nThey are part of cuisine worldwide.

Black beans are relatively\nthin-skinned and cook quickly (about 30\nminutes) if you want to keep them some-\nwhat firm.  For soups and stews, they may\nneed to be boiled for 1 1/2 hours or longer.\nServing Suggestions\nBlack beans are a delicious dish all by them-\nselves, served with a dollop of low-fat sour\ncream and bits of diced avocado or guacamole.\nThey are also often stewed, accompanied by\nrice.  They are the key ingredient in frijoles,\nrefritos, or refried beans (but go easy on the\nfat), and they are the star of black bean soup. \nCranberry Beans\nCranberry beans are about a half-inch long\nand are brownish with pink splotches that\ndisappear when cooked.  Cranberry beans\nhave a nutty flavor.  Their creamy, red-\nstreaked flesh has a smooth texture. \nNutritionally speaking, cranberry beans\nare an excellent source of folate and a good\nsource of iron, magnesium, phosphorus,\npotassium, and copper.\nPreparation Tips\nPresoak beans. Cranberry beans can be sub-\nstituted in any recipe that calls for red beans\nor white beans, and they can be prepared\nlike pinto beans (simmering in water, cov-\nered, for 50 to 60 minutes).\nServing Suggestions\nCranberry beans can be added to pasta dishes\nand salads.  In Europe, they often are used in\nstews. \nKidney Beans \nAs their name suggests, kidney beans are\nkidney-shaped.  They are available in an\nassortment of colors.  Chili lovers will read-\nily recognize the most common kidney\nWHY DO BEANS CAUSE GASSINESS?\nBeans do cause flatulence in many persons who eat them.  The gassiness is the\nresult of fermentation of the seeds’ complex sugars, or oligosaccharides, by bacteria\nin the large intestine.  Persons who eat beans frequently find that they do not\ndevelop gas as much.\nTo reduce the flatulence effect, try these strategies:\n•\nThe flatulence-producing effect of beans can be further reduced by changing\nthe water several times during soaking and during cooking and by simmering the\nbeans slowly until they are tender. \n•\nIf a recipe calls for salt, lemon juice, vinegar, or tomatoes, these ingredients\nshould be added near the end of cooking because acidic ingredients stop the\nprocess by which legumes absorb liquid and soften.\n•\nUse commercially available products that can be added to dishes before\nserving.  These products contain an enzyme that breaks down the complex \nsugars before they start causing problems.\nbean:  the red kidney bean, which has a\ndeep-red color and a full flavor.\nAnother type of kidney bean is the flag-\neolet; its seeds are small, thin, and pale-green.\nMainly available dried, canned, or frozen in\nthe United States, flageolets are more pop-\nular in Europe.  The cannellini bean is\nanother type of kidney bean.  It is large and\nwhite and has a more delicate flavor than\nthe red kidney bean.\nKidney beans are an excellent source of\nfolic acid and a good source of iron, mag-\nnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper,\nand thiamin.\nPreparation Tips\nKidney beans commonly are canned.  If\nyou choose to use fresh beans instead of\ncanned, prepare red kidney beans by pre-\nsoaking and then simmering them in water,\ncovered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Flageolets and\ncannellini beans can be cooked with the\nsame method for 25 to 30 minutes.\nServing Suggestions\nConsider red kidney beans an all-purpose\nbean.  They make good additions to chili\nand can be baked, puréed, or refried.\nCannellini beans can be added to salads or\nsoups.  Flageolets are often served in a\nwhite sauce seasoned with shallots, thyme,\nbay leaf, and clove.  In this way, they are\nsaid to be served “French style.”  In France,\nthey also may be served with a roast leg of\nlamb.\nPinto Beans\nPinto means “painted” in Spanish.  It is an\napt word to describe this bean because they\nare pink or beige with reddish brown spots\nand streaks.  Pinto beans are popular in the\nAmerican Southwest and in Mexico, where\nthey are an essential part of everyday cuisine.\nFrom a nutrition perspective, pinto beans\nare an excellent source of folate and a good\nsource of iron, magnesium, phosphorus,\npotassium, copper, and thiamin.\nPreparation Tips\nPinto beans usually are sold dried but are\nalso available cooked and canned.  Presoak\ndried beans and simmer them, covered, for\n50 to 60 minutes.\n328\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nServing Suggestions\nPinto beans are great served with rice, as\nrefried beans, puréed, or in chili. \nWhite Beans \nWhite bean is a term given to varieties of\nbeans that have light-colored seeds.  There\nare several varieties of white beans: \nMarrow beans — The largest and\nroundest of white beans, marrow beans are\noften grown in the eastern United States.\nThey are creamy but firm after cooking and\nusually are available as a dried bean. \nGreat Northern beans — Great\nNorthern beans are smaller than marrow\nbeans and have a more delicate flavor.  They\nare typically grown in the Midwest.  They\nstand up well to baking.\nNavy beans — Most people know these\nas the beans found in canned pork and bean\nproducts.  Navy beans require lengthy, slow\ncooking, which makes them excellent addi-\ntions to soups and baked dishes.\nWhite beans are an excellent source of\niron and folate and a good source of magne-\nsium, phosphorus, potassium, and copper.\nPreparation Tips\nPresoak beans.  Cook them in water, cov-\nered for marrow beans, 35 to 45 minutes;\nfor Great Northern, 1 to 1 1/2 hours; and\nfor navy beans, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nServing Suggestions\nMild-flavored white beans can be puréed,\nbaked, added to soups and stews, or com-\nbined with other vegetables and served with\npasta.  Navy bean soup is a hearty dish made\nfrom the navy bean.  Baked beans, usually\nmade of navy beans, are enjoyed cold or hot. \nA SEAFARING BEAN?\nNavy beans are so-named because\nthey have been a common dish served\nto sailors in the U.S.  Navy since the\nmid 1800s.  Sometimes they are also\nreferred to as “Yankee beans.” \nSlow cooking with molasses gives “white” navy beans their color.\nDolichos Beans\nDerived from the Greek word dolikhos,\nmeaning long or elongated, the general term\n“dolichos beans” is used to refer to legumes\nof the genus Vigna and the lablab bean.\nCommon beans considered dolichos beans\ninclude the adzuki bean, the black-eyed\npea, the lablab bean, and the mung bean.\nAdzuki Beans (Azuki Beans)\nAdzuki beans have been cultivated and\nenjoyed for many centuries in Asia.  The\nChinese have attributed mystical power to\nthese beans and believe that they bring good\nluck.  This is one reason they are a part of\nmany foods used at celebrations. \nThe bean has a rich, somewhat sweet\nflavor.  It has a reddish color.  The plant that\nbears adzuki beans has 5-inch-long cylin-\ndrical pods that contain 4 to 12 oblong seeds\nwith flat ends.  Adzuki beans are usually\nsold dried, but they also may be sold as\nyoung pods that are eaten like green beans. \nAdzuki beans are an excellent source of\nfolate and a good source of iron, magnesium,\nphosphorus, potassium, zinc, and copper.\nPreparation Tips\nPresoak dried beans.  Simmer in water,\ncovered, for 30 to 40 minutes.\nServing Suggestions\nAdzuki beans have a mild, delicate flavor\nand grainy texture.  Sometimes they are\neaten with rice.  However, they are often\nmade into a flour or paste, which is used\nin desserts or candies.  Combined with\nsugar, water, starch, plant gums, and other\ningredients, adzuki beans are used as a filling\nfor bread, steamed cakes, and dumplings.\nIn addition, they can be puffed like corn\nor sprouted.  Adzuki beans may be roasted\nto make a substitute for coffee. \nBlack-Eyed Peas \nThe black-eyed pea has many names, includ-\ning the cowpea, callivance, cherry bean, frijol,\nChina pea, and Indian pea.  It gets its name\nfrom the circular black hilum, or “eye,” on\nthe seed’s inner curve, where it is attached\nto the pod.  The hilum may also be brown,\nred, or yellow.  The seeds can be wrinkled\nor smooth and range in shape from round\nto kidney-shaped.  The plant that bears\nblack-eyed peas is grown in warm regions of\nthe world and can grow to 3 feet in height.\nBlack-eyed peas are an excellent source\nof folate and a good source of magnesium\nand potassium.\nPreparation Tips\nBecause black-eyed peas have thin skins,\npresoaking is optional.  Soaked or unsoaked\nversions of fresh and dried black-eyed peas\ncook in about 30 to 60 minutes, covered,\nover low heat.  Black-eyed peas are also\navailable frozen and canned.\nServing Suggestions\nBlack-eyed peas can be used to make soups,\nsalads, fritters, and casseroles and are often\nserved with meat.  They are the key ingre-\ndient in the Southern dish called “Hoppin’\nJohn,” which consists of black-eyed peas\ncooked with salt pork and seasonings and\nserved with rice.  According to southern U.S.\ntradition, eating black-eyed peas on New\nYear’s Day brings good luck for the year.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n329\nMung Bean\nAlthough its name suggests Chinese or\nAsian cuisine, the mung bean has been\ngrown in India for centuries.

The seeds themselves are tiny —\nabout one-eighth inch in diameter.\nNutritionally speaking, the mung bean\nseed is an excellent source of folic acid and\na good source of  magnesium, phosphorus,\nand thiamin.\nPreparation Tips\nMung beans are available as dried beans or as\nsprouts.  Wash sprouts thoroughly before use.\nLablab (Hyacinth Bean)\nAlthough grown in the United States mainly\nas an ornamental plant, the lablab is a pop-\nular food in Africa, Asia, and Central and\nSouth America.  Seeds are less than a half-\ninch long.  Their color ranges from white\nto brown, red, and black.  The plant itself\ngrows as a vine, with large broad leaves.\nLablab is an excellent source of iron and\nmagnesium and a good source of phos-\nphorus, zinc, copper, and thiamin.\nPreparation Tips\nLablab pods can be eaten fresh.  Dried\nbeans can be prepared in the same way as\nother legumes.\nServing Suggestions\nLablab sprouts can be eaten.

Immature\nlima beans can be eaten fresh with or with-\nout the pods.  Although mature pods are\ntoo tough to be edible, the seeds are avail-\nable year-round in frozen, canned, and\ndried forms that are usually labeled accord-\ning to size rather than botanical variety.\nPresoak dried beans, then simmer in water,\ncovered, for 60 to 90 minutes.\nUnlike many other types of beans, lima\nbeans can be easily overcooked; they quickly\nbecome mushy if cooked longer than nec-\nessary to make them soft. \nServing Suggestions\nThe taste of cooked lima beans is starchy but\ndelicate.  They can be boiled and served whole\nor mashed, or they can be added to soups and\nsalads.  In succotash, a traditional Southern\ndish that includes peppers, tomatoes, and\ncorn, lima beans are the main ingredient. \nPeanuts\nDespite their name, peanuts are not nuts\nat all, but the seeds of a legume.

Whole beans cook in about an hour.\nServing Suggestions\nMung bean sprouts can be used fresh in sal-\nads or stir-fried with vegetables, noodles,\nand meat, poultry, seafood, or tofu.\nBeans can be ground into flour to make\nnoodles (called bean threads or cellophane\nnoodles because of their thinness and trans-\nparent appearance) or candy.  Puréed mung\nbeans may be used to fill breads and pas-\ntries.  They are also used to make moog dal,\nan Indian spread eaten with rice or bread.\nLentil\nThe lentil was probably one of the earliest\nlegumes to be domesticated.  Now culti-\nvated in many parts of the world, the lentil\nis known as ads in Arabic, merimek in\nTurkey, messer in Ethiopia, heramame in\nJapan, and masoor, dal, or gram in India,\nwhich is now the leading producer. \nThis bushy plant reaches a maximum\nof 2 feet in height.  The pods are short, flat,\nand oblong.  Seeds can be red, orange,\nyellow, brown, or green.  The seeds are\nclassified as large (macrospermae) or small\n(microspermae), with each type contain-\ning dozens of varieties.\nLentils, like many legumes, are an excel-\nlent source of folate and a good source of\npotassium, iron, and phosphorus.\nPreparation Tips\nLentils are available in a variety of forms.\nThey can be purchased whole, husked, and\nsplit like peas.  They cook quickly and, thus,\ndried lentils do not need to be soaked before\npreparation.  Different varieties call for dif-\nferent cooking times — from 5 minutes for\nyellow lentils to 30 minutes for brown or\ngreen lentils.  Lentils should always be\nLentils\nLima beans\nwashed before cooking to remove dirt, dust,\nand, possibly, tiny stones.\nServing Suggestions\nBecause lentils do not hold their shape well,\nthey are popularly used to make soups and\nstews.  They also can be added to salads or\nmixed with grains to make breads and cakes.\nLentils are particularly popular in India,\nwhere they are frequently made into a spicy\ndish called dal.  Dal is made with lentils,\ntomatoes, onions, and other seasonings.  Dal\nalso can be made from many other legumes.\nLima Beans\nLima beans were originally cultivated in\nSouth America, from where they were\nbrought to Europe, Asia, and Africa by\nEuropean explorers.  In the southern United\nStates, lima beans are called butter beans,\nand the mottled purple varieties are called\ncalico or speckled butter beans.  Lima beans\nalso may be referred to as Madagascar beans. \nLima bean plants bear flat, oblong pods\nabout 2 to 4 inches in length that contain\ntwo to four smooth, kidney-shaped seeds.\nThere are numerous varieties of lima beans,\nand their seeds vary in size and color.  The\ncommonly sold seeds are pale green, but\npurple, red, brown, black, and mottled ones\nare also available.  The two most common\nvarieties are the Fordhook and the baby lima,\nwhich is smaller and milder.\nhow they are used and because of their nut-\nlike shells.  The “shells,” however, are actu-\nally the fibrous seed pods of a legume,\nencasing one to three seeds wrapped in an\nedible, papery thin seed coat.  These seed\npods are easy to crack and range from less\nthan an inch to about 2 inches long and\nhave the same contours as the round seeds\nunderneath.\nPeanut plants are separated into either\nbunch or runner types.  The bunch type\nbears seed pods close to the base of the\nplant, whereas the runner type has seed\npods scattered along the branches.  Runner\ntypes were introduced in the 1970s and are\nnow more popular than bunch types, prob-\nably because runner peanuts are primarily\nused to make peanut butter, for which half\nof all peanuts are produced.\nSpanish peanuts — a bunch-type\npeanut with small, round seeds covered by\na reddish brown skin — are usually roasted,\nsalted, and vacuum-packed.  Virginia\npeanuts, which can be a runner or a bunch\nplant, are larger and more oval and are usually\nsold roasted in the shell. \nPeanuts contain quite a bit of fat, but the\nfat in them is primarily monounsaturated\nfat.  Peanuts are  an excellent source of mag-\nnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, niacin,\nand folate and a good source of iron.\nGeorge Washington Carver, an African-\nAmerican botanist who worked in the late\n19th century, is well known as the “Father\nof the Peanut Industry” for having inge-\nniously developed more than 300 uses for\nthe peanut, including as an ingredient in\nshoe polish, soap, bleach, medicine, ink,\npaint, and ice cream.  In 1890, an American\nphysician invented what we now know as\npeanut butter to provide an easily digestible,\nnutritious food for his elderly patients.\nHowever, long before this, other cultures\nmade similar edible paste from peanuts.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n331\na vegetable in African, Indian, South\nAmerican, and Asian cooking.  Peanuts can\nbe cooked with fish, meat, and poultry and\nused to flavor sauces, soups, salads, and\ndesserts.

The\nyoung pods, leaves, and plant tips can be\ncooked and eaten in the same manner as\na green vegetable.  Unshelled peanuts can\nbe refrigerated in an airtight container for\nup to 6 months, and shelled peanuts for\nup to 3 months.  Peanuts also can be\ncooked, a process that generally takes\nabout 30 minutes. \nServing Suggestions\nAlthough peanuts are usually consumed as\na snack, turned into peanut butter, or used\nto make candy or baked goods in the\nUnited States, they are frequently used as\nPeanut butter — not just for sandwiches\nPeanuts\n332\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nbeans are an excellent source of a variety of\nnutrients, including iron, vitamin B6, and\nphosphorus, and a good source of potassi-\num and calcium.  Also, they are rich in the\nphytochemicals called isoflavones.\nSoybeans are usually processed into\nother products.  For example, soy oil is used\nto make ink for newspapers.  Soybean prod-\nucts are added to a variety of foods during\nprocessing.  Many foods, though, are made\nalmost entirely from soy (see sidebar:  “Soy”\nMany Products to Choose From, page 333).\nFor cultures in which soy is the main\nsource of protein, rates of cardiovascular\ndisease and some kinds of cancers are rela-\ntively low.  Researchers are also looking into\nwhether soy plays a role in preventing osteo-\nporosis and easing hot flashes associated\nwith menopause.  Some studies suggest\nthere may be a link (see Chapter 2 sidebar:\nSoy What? page 34). \nAlthough it may be too early to make\nspecific health claims for soy, there is\nevidence that adding soy to your diet makes\ngood nutritional sense.  And, you may just\ndiscover a whole new range of healthful\nfood products to enjoy.\nPreparation Tips\nGenerally, the soybeans now being incorpo-\nrated into food are already processed, such as\nthe soybean oil in margarines and salad dress-\nings and the soy protein in baby formula and\nmeat substitutes.  Or, they may already be\nincorporated into food products, such as tofu.\nDried soybeans are often available at health\nfood stores.  They need to be soaked before\ncooking to soften them.  They are usually\nsimmered, sometimes up to 9 hours, before\nthey are softened enough to eat.  Fresh and\nfrozen soybeans are now appearing in markets.\nMany cooks recommend cooking soybeans\nwith full-flavored items because they are rather\nflavorless by themselves.\nway as green beans.

Rinse\nthoroughly.  When buying fresh peas, look\nfor bright-green, smooth, uniform pods that\nare free of spots, dryness, or other blight.\nServing Suggestions\nPeas can be added to meals in a variety of\nways.  They can be braised, boiled, steamed,\nor stir-fried and added to pasta dishes and\ncasseroles.  Pea pods can be substituted in\nany recipe that calls for green beans.\nRaw, fresh peas, although difficult to\nfind, are tasty additions to salads.  So are\nsnow peas and sugar snap peas.  Fresh and\nfrozen peas should be cooked only briefly\nto preserve their color and flavor.\nSoybeans\nIf the only soy in your diet comes from the\nsoy sauce you sprinkle on chow mein, you\nmay be missing out on more than just a\ntasty and versatile food.  Soy is an inex-\npensive way to add protein to your diet and\nmay also help reduce fat when substituted\nfor meat in traditional dishes. \nSoy products come from the soybean, a\nlegume native to northern China.  The\nUnited States now produces much of the\nworld’s soybeans.  There are more than\n1,000 varieties of soybeans.  They range in\nsize from a pea to a cherry.  Colors include\nred, yellow, green, brown, and black.  The\nprotein in soy is a “complete” protein —\nthe most complete you can get from veg-\netable sources — and just as good nutri-\ntionally as animal protein.  In fact, there is\nmore protein in 1 cup of soybeans than in\n3 ounces of cooked meat.  In addition, soy-\nPeas\nLike peanuts, peas may not be immedi-\nately recognizable as a legume, because they\nare marketed and consumed as a vegetable.\nBut appearances are deceiving because, like\nother legumes, peas are an excellent source\nof protein.  A serving of peas (about 3/4\nof a cup) contains as much protein as a\ntablespoon of peanut butter, but with far\nless fat.\nThe pea is an annual plant that grows\nfrom 1 to 5 feet high.  It requires a cool,\nrelatively humid climate.  There are more\nthan 1,000 different types of peas.  Different\nplants produce smooth-seeded peas, wrin-\nkled-seeded peas, field peas, snow peas, and\nsugar snap peas.\nSmooth-seeded peas are commonly\nsold frozen, whereas wrinkled-seeded peas\nare used for canning because they are\nsweeter.  Field peas are grown mainly for\ndrying.  Snow peas and sugar snap peas\nare grown for their edible crisp, sweet pods. \nPeas are a good source of iron.\nPreparation Tips\nPeas are available fresh, canned, frozen, or\ndried.  Dried peas, which can be yellow or\ngreen, are sold whole.  Or, they may be split.\nWhole dried peas need to be soaked before\ncooking and may take up to 1 to 2 hours to\nbecome soft.  Split dried peas do not need\nto be soaked; however, they do not hold\ntheir shape during cooking and so are gen-\nerally used for sauces and soups.  A familiar\ndish made of split peas is, of course, split\npea soup.  Snow peas and sugar snap peas\nare usually sold fresh.  Before eating, rinse\nthem off and then cut the top from a snow\npea pod.  Remove the string from both sides\nof a sugar snap pea’s seams by pulling the\nattached fibrous string upward from the\nbottom.  Although they are delicious raw,\npea pods also can be cooked in the same\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough Americans generally eat soy as part\nof other products, soybeans can be eaten\nfresh, roasted, ground into flour, or pressed\ninto oil.  The Chinese first invented soy\nsauce, then the Japanese borrowed the\nprocess to make their own sweeter version.\nDark and light varieties are available.  Serve\ndark soy sauce with red meat and light soy\nsauce with chicken or seafood.  Because of its\nhigh sodium level, it should be used spar-\ningly if you are watching your salt intake.\nTofu, made from coagulating soy milk\nuntil it forms curds, is available in soft, firm,\nand extra-firm consistencies, depending on\nhow much liquid was left in the pressed\ncurds.  Tofu can be used in salads, soups,\nand stir-fried dishes.\nNuts and Seeds\nNuts are high in fat and calories, but taken\nin moderation they can be part of a health-\nful diet.  Nuts are not only flavorful, but,\nounce for ounce, also full of nutrients. \nMost nuts are seeds or the dried fruit\nfrom trees.  Peanuts, which are commonly\nthought of as nuts, are actually legumes.  They\nbelong to the same family as peas and beans.\nThe word “nut” can be confusing.  The\nterm originally referred to an edible kernel\nsurrounded by a hard shell.  In its most\nscientific definition, the term now refers to\na single-seed fruit with the seed surrounded\nby a dry, tough fruit.  This definition works\nfor hazelnuts, beechnuts, and chestnuts,\nbut it does not “fit” almonds and walnuts\n(because their surrounding fruits are\ntheoretically edible) or peanuts (which are\nlegumes).  Adding to the confusion, Brazil\nnuts and pine nuts are not nuts, either.\nThey are actually seeds, and sunflower seeds\nare actually fruits.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n333\n“SOY” MANY PRODUCTS TO CHOOSE FROM\nSoybean-based products take many forms.  Besides oil that is pressed from soy-\nbeans, soy food products include the following:\nMiso — Miso is a salty, strong-flavored paste made by fermenting soybean\nmeal and a grain, such as rice or wheat.  It is used as a flavor enhancer and thicken-\ning agent in many Asian dishes.  Colors range from light yellow to dark orange,\ndepending on the type of soybean used to make the miso. \nSoy flour — Many prepared foods include soy flour, which can be made from\nwhole soybeans or soybean meal.\nSoy nuts — Roasted soybeans, commonly eaten as a snack.\nSoy sauce — Another product made from fermented soybeans, soy sauce is an\nessential condiment and cooking ingredient in Asian cuisine.  To make soy sauce,\nsoybeans or soy meal is mixed with ground wheat.  Fermentation may take 1 to 3\nmonths.\nSoybean sprouts — As the name suggests, these are germinated soybeans.\nThey are used in salads and as a garnish.\nSoybean milk — Soybean milk is made from soybeans that are soaked, ground,\nheated, and then filtered.  Soy milk is a part of many baby formulas for infants who\nare lactose-intolerant.  Soy milk can be drunk as a beverage.  Dried soy milk is\nsometimes added to products such as ice cream.\nTempeh — An essential component in Indonesian cooking, tempeh is a meat\nsubstitute that is made from soybeans that are soaked, dehulled, cooked, and then\nfermented.  Tempeh can be formed or made into patties.  Tempeh is available in\nthe United States in health food stores.\nTofu — Made by coagulating the protein from soy beans, tofu is a high-protein\ncurd that is used in many Asian dishes.  Tofu is sold in blocks and is often used in\nplace of meat.  It generally has a spongy texture. It can be cooked in a variety of\nways to make dressings, dips, and shakes.  It picks up the flavor of marinades and\nthus will taste like meat in many dishes.\nYuba — A product \nmade of the protein-rich \nskin that forms on the top \nof soybean milk when heated \njust to boiling, yuba has \na stringy, chewy texture.  \nIt is made of protein \nand oil and is often \nused to produce \nimitation\nmeat products.\nCommon soybean\nproducts, such as\nsoy milk, tofu, and\nfresh soybeans\nNuts are a versatile food.  They can be\neaten fresh, cooked, and, sometimes, with\ntheir shell.  They are available whole or\nchopped, salted and unsalted.  In addition,\nproducts made from them include butters,\noils, and spreads.\nNutrition\nThe protein in nuts and seeds lacks an\nessential amino acid called lysine, which\ncan be gained from legumes and animal\nproducts.  Although nuts are high in calo-\nries for their size, they are also considered\na “nutrient-dense” food.  They contain a\nlot of nutrients in relation to their calories.\nNuts are also rich in different plant com-\npounds.  Flavonoids, for instance, are found\nin all nuts.  These antioxidants help reduce\nthe formation of free radicals in the body that\nmay contribute to cancer and cardiovascu-\nlar disease.  Relative to their size, nuts are also\namong the best plant sources for protein.\nNuts are generally high in fat.  In most\ncases, more than 75 percent of their calories\ncomes from fat (the exception being chest-\nnuts — only 8 percent of the calories are\nfrom fat).  But, on the plus side, it is the\n“right kind” of fat.  Most of the fat in nuts\nis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated,\nwith the exception of the coconut and palm\nkernel.  Unlike saturated fats (typically\nfound in red meats and dairy products),\nthese fats do not appear to increase blood\ncholesterol levels.  In small amounts,\nmonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats\nmay actually lower cholesterol levels. \nWatch the salt, however.  Nuts do not\ncome by that naturally — it is an added fea-\nture.  If you need to limit your salt intake,\nlook for products with no added salt.\nSelection\nPurchase nuts with a clean, uniform appear-\nance.  When buying nuts in the shell, look\n334\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\ncentury, cross-breeding among sweet\nalmonds created new varieties that include\nthe California, Mission, Price, Carmel, and\nthe Nonpareil (the most popular variety\ntoday).  Since then, approximately 30 addi-\ntional varieties have been developed and\nare grown commercially.\nNutritionally, almonds have more\ncalcium than any other nut and are an excel-\nlent source of iron, riboflavin, and vitamin\nE.  More than 60% of the fat comes from\nmonounsaturated fat.\nPreparation Tips\nAlmonds are available whole (both shelled\nand unshelled), sliced, slivered, diced, and\nchopped.  If you buy whole almonds that\nare not already blanched, you need to\nblanch them yourself by pouring boiling\nwater on them, draining them after a\nminute, and then pouring cold water on\nthem, draining again after a minute.  After\nblanching, rub off the skins.  Toasting\nalmonds before adding them to dishes\nenhances their flavor and texture.\nServing Suggestions\nThe mild flavor of almonds makes them a\npopular addition to a wide variety of dishes.\nThey are popular as fillings and as ingredi-\nents in pastries and other baked goods.  But\nalmonds also can be used in sauces, stuffing,\nand pasta dishes.  A well-known vegetable\nfor whole, unbroken shells.  To ensure max-\nimal freshness, look for nuts that are vacuum-\nsealed in bags, jars, or other containers.\nStorage\nBecause of their high fat content, nuts and\nseeds should be stored in dark, cool, dry\nconditions in closed glass or plastic con-\ntainers to prevent rancidity.  Unshelled nuts\nkeep better than shelled nuts, which can\nbecome rancid in a few weeks unless frozen.\nMost unshelled nuts will keep 2 months to\na year in the refrigerator or a year or more\nin the freezer.\nSafety Issues\nAllergies to nuts are one of the most com-\nmon kinds of food allergies.  Symptoms of\nan allergic reaction include nasal conges-\ntion, hives, itching, swelling, wheezing or\nshortness of breath, nausea, upset stomach,\ncramps, heartburn, gas or diarrhea, light-\nheadedness, or fainting.  If you suspect that\nyou have any food allergies, see an allergist\nfor a careful evaluation.\nThe following pages are an overview of\nnuts and seeds available, along with tips to\ninclude them in your meals.\nAlmond\nAlthough almonds are native to the warmer\nregions of western Asia and northern Africa,\nthey grow well in California, where 99 per-\ncent of domestic almonds are grown.\nThe almond fruit is the edible seed of\nsweet almond trees.  Almonds are teardrop-\nshaped and surrounded by a shell and an\nouter fleshy hull.  They can be either sweet\nor bitter.  The sweet types have a delicate\nyet distinctive flavor, but the bitter almond\nis inedible in its raw form because it con-\ntains traces of the poison prussic acid, a\ncyanide compound.  During the late 19th\nAlmonds\nA variety of nuts\nand seeds\ndish is green beans amandine, which essen-\ntially is green beans topped with slivered\nalmonds.  Marzipan, a German candy, is\nmade from sweetened almond paste.\nAlmond oil may be added to salads, and\nalmond extract or essence may be used as a\nflavoring in baked goods and drinks. \nBeechnut\nBeech trees grow in the temperate forests\nof Europe, North America, Asia, and North\nAfrica and can be up to 120 feet tall.\nBeechnuts are simply the seeds (or nuts)\nenclosed in prickly burrs that fall to the\nground in the autumn.  Beechnuts look\nlike small chestnuts and taste like hazel-\nnuts.  More than 10 species of beech trees\nproduce nuts. \nBeechnuts are an excellent source of thi-\namin and riboflavin and a good source of\niron.  Monounsaturated and polyunsatu-\nrated fats provide more than 80% of the\nfat content.\nPreparation Tips\nThe thin coat surrounding each cream-col-\nored nut must be removed before it is eaten.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n335\nrich, creamy, and sweet and is a good source\nof phosphorus and thiamin and contains\nsome calcium.  This nut also has a high fat\ncontent, although most of it is unsaturated.\nOnly after the fruits have fallen to the\nground are they harvested and chopped\nopen to obtain the nuts.  Because the trees\ngrow wild in the heart of the Amazon jun-\ngle, the nuts can be shipped only during the\nrainy season, when streams and rivers are\nnavigable.  Although the nuts are obtained\nonly in Brazil, most are exported, and native\nBrazilians rarely eat Brazil nuts.\nThe Brazil nut is also known as the para\nnut, butternut, cream nut, and castanea.\nOil from the nut is used to make soap or\nas an industrial lubricant.\nPreparation Tips\nBrazil nuts are available as raw, unshelled\nnuts or shelled and roasted or dry-roasted.\nBecause of their high fat content, both\nAlthough beechnuts were once used as feed\nfor farm animals, they were also common-\nly eaten during famines.\nServing Suggestions\nBeechnuts taste best roasted, a process that\nmellows the flavor of these nuts.  Ground\nbeechnuts also may be used as a coffee sub-\nstitute.  In Europe, oil is made from beech-\nnuts and is used for cooking. \nBrazil Nut\nThe Brazil nut grows on an evergreen tree,\nmainly along the Amazon, Orinoco, and\nRio Negro rivers of South America.  About\n6 inches in diameter and resembling a\ncoconut, the fruit of the Brazil nut tree has\n18 to 20 nuts within its hard shell.  Inside,\nthe triangular nuts are arranged like the\nwedges of an orange.  It is the white kernel\ninside this shell that is eaten.  This kernel is\nshelled and unshelled nuts should be refrig-\nerated or frozen to maintain freshness.  Buy\nonly vacuum-packed nuts to maintain their\nfreshness.\nServing Suggestions\nBrazil nuts add a crunchy texture to cakes\nand breads.  Because of their sweetness, they\nare also used in ice cream, cookies, and\ncandies.  Brazil nuts can be difficult to shell.\nKeep a nutcracker handy if planning to\nserve them whole and in the shell, often a\ntradition in many families at holidays.\nCashew Nut\nIndia is the world’s leading producer of\ncashew nuts, although other important pro-\nducers include Mozambique, Tanzania,\nKenya, and Brazil. \nCashew trees produce a fruit-like stalk\ncalled the cashew apple (even though it is\nthe shape of a pear).  Attached to the end\nof the cashew apple is the cashew nut,\nwhich has a smooth, ash-colored outer shell.\nThe edible kernel of the nut varies between\nthree-quarters of an inch and an inch in\nlength.  Its generic name, Anacardium, refers\nto a heart shape, but cashews have more of\na kidney shape. \nIt is impossible to buy cashews in the\nshell because the edible kernel is covered\nwith an inner shell, and the space between\nthe inner and outer shells is filled with a\nthick, caustic, toxic oil (related to poison\nivy).  Unshelled, unroasted cashew nuts will\n336\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nburn the mouth and lips and raise blisters\non the skin.\nNutritionally, cashews are an excellent\nsource of iron, phosphorus, and zinc and\na good source of riboflavin, thiamin, and\npotassium.  The primary source of fat in\ncashews is monounsaturated fat.\nPreparation Tips\nCashew nuts have a sweet, buttery flavor\nthat is further enhanced by roasting.\nCashews are bought ready to use.  Look for\ncashews sold in vacuum-packed cans to\nguarantee maximal freshness.\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough Americans view the cashew as a\nnut for baking or dipped in chocolate for a\ntreat, it also can be added to stir-fry dishes\nand salads.  Cashews also can be made into\na delicious nut butter. \nChestnut\nChestnut trees are found in Asia, Europe,\nand North America, and their fruit has been\nmade popular in the lyrics of a Christmas\ncarol.  The trees that bear chestnuts were\nfirst cultivated in China about 5,000 years\nago.  Mount Olympus, home to the gods of\nancient Greece, was said to have had an\nabundance of chestnut trees. \nBrazil nuts\nCashew nuts\nChestnut trees are also long-lived.\nSome trees that were grafted more than 500\nyears ago are still alive.  The trees are also\nadaptable to poor land.  The nuts are har-\nvested by hand once they have fallen from\nthe burr, the name for the spiny outer cov-\nering.  Trees typically start bearing nuts after\nabout 25 years.\nChestnuts can range in size from a half\ninch to more than an inch, depending on\nthe variety.  They have one rounded side\nand one flat side and one rounded end and\none pointed end.  The roasted kernel is soft,\nmeaty, and sweet.\nThe common American chestnut,\nnative to the eastern United States, once\ndominated the forests of Maine to Georgia.\nBut this tree is now nearly extinct because\nof a tree blight caused by a fungus.  Today,\nonly a small number of trees survive.\nPreparation Tips\nThe most traditional use of chestnuts is to\nroast them whole, with shell and skin, and\nto peel and eat them while they are still warm.\nBefore roasting, cut an “x” into the flat side\nof the nuts to prevent them from exploding.\nChestnuts also can be boiled or steamed. \nServing Suggestions\nUse chestnuts as an ingredient in stuffing,\ncasseroles, and baked goods.  A glazed type\nof candy (marrons glacés) is made from sug-\nared chestnuts.  Ground chestnuts also can\nbe used as a coffee and chocolate substitute.\nGinkgo Nut\nThe ginkgo nut grows on what is considered\nthe oldest known living species of tree.  It has\nremained virtually unchanged for 250 million\nyears and is considered a living fossil.\nThe ginkgo nut is the seed of an ined-\nible, apricot-like fruit that is well known\nfor its strong, some might say offensive,\nodor.  Nuts borne from female trees have\nhard, buff-colored shells that are pointed\non either end.  The meat inside has the\nsame shape and color, is soft, and has a\ndelicate, sweet taste.  Although the ginkgo\ntree is commonly grown in U.S. cities\nbecause it is resistant to air pollution, many\npeople are unaware that it bears nuts and\nthat they can be eaten.\nIn Asia, ginkgo nuts and the fan-\nshaped leaves from the tree (Ginkgo biloba\nis the scientific name) have been used in\ntraditional medicine for thousands of\nyears.  Extracts and powders derived from\nginkgo leaves are among the top-selling\nherbal supplements sold in the United\nStates, where they are promoted as being\na memory aid.\nScientists in the United States are study-\ning the efficacy of ginkgo extracts, but\nresults so far have been inconclusive.\nAdditionally, because scientists do not know\nhow the extract works or its potential side\neffects, they are not recommending gink-\ngo extracts be used for medicinal purposes\nat this time.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n337\nHazelnuts\nRoasted chestnuts\nFrom a nutrition standpoint, ginkgo\nnuts are an excellent source of phospho-\nrus, potassium, copper, thiamin, and niacin.\nPreparation Tips\nBefore ginkgo nuts can be consumed or\ncooked, the hard shells must be removed.\nThe kernels must then be soaked in hot\nwater to loosen the thin skins.  Fresh, dried,\nor canned ginkgo nuts are widely available\nin Asian grocery stores. \nServing Suggestions\nGinkgo nuts can be eaten as a snack after\nthey are roasted.  They are used in many\nAsian main dishes and desserts.  Ginkgo\nnuts are a key ingredient in an egg-custard-\nlike dish called chawanmushi. \nHazelnut\nThe United States produces about 9,000\ntons of unshelled hazelnuts, and Oregon\nand Washington account for 5 percent of\nthe entire world’s production.  The grape-\nsized nuts have a thick, woody, brownish\nred shell that readily separates from the ker-\nnel.  Nuts grow from leafy husks that open\nas the nut ripens.  The nuts begin to drop\nfrom the trees in August.  In September or\nOctober, they are swept up, washed, and\nthen dried.  They are sorted for size and\nthen sold for processing.  Hazelnuts are\nreferred to by a variety of names, includ-\ning filbert or cobnut. \nThere are 10 major species of hazelnut\ntrees.  The most commonly grown are the\nEuropean, the American, and the Turkish\nhazelnut.  Various hybrids are based on\nthese types.  These hybrids include the\nWinkler, Duchilly, and the Barcelona,\nwhich is thought by many hazelnut fanciers\nto produce the finest nuts. \nNutritionally speaking, hazelnuts are\nan excellent source of iron, magnesium,\nphosphorus, potassium, and thiamin and\na good source of niacin.  Monounsaturated\nfat is the primary source of fat in hazelnuts.\nPreparation Tips\nThe hazelnut kernel is sweet.  It is wrapped\nin a thin, slightly bitter-tasting, brown skin.\nThis skin must be removed before the nuts\nare used.  Heat the shelled nuts in a 350°\nFahrenheit oven for 10 to 15 minutes until\nthe skin begins to flake.  Then, wrap the\nwarm nuts in a tea towel and rub them with\nthe towel after about 5 minutes to remove\nthe skin.\nServing Suggestions\nHazelnuts can be eaten raw or they can be\nroasted.  Chopped hazelnuts add crunch\nto salads, soups, sauces, breads, cakes, and\ncookies.  Finely ground nuts can be used\nas a replacement for flour.  Hazelnut paste,\nmade by grinding the nuts to a fine butter\nand mixing with sugar, is used for bakery\nfillings and toppings.\nA fragrant oil made from pressed hazel-\nnuts adds a nutty flavor to dressings, sauces,\npastries, and coffee.\nLotus Seed\nThe lotus plant and especially its flowers\nhave been used as a motif in the arts of\nthe ancient cultures of India, China, and\nEgypt for centuries.  Although many peo-\nple know it is grown for its ornamental\nflowers, the lotus plant also has edible\nroots and seeds.  The creamy seeds add a\nmild flavor to cuisine in many Asian\ncountries.\nIn addition to the seeds, the roots of\nthe lotus plant can be eaten.  When sliced\nand cooked, the light brown, starchy roots\nhave a crisp texture.  They are commonly\nused as a vegetable in Asian dishes.  Even\nthe leaves of the plant may be eaten.  Young\nleaves can be eaten raw.  Mature leaves may\nbe used to wrap rice, meat, and fruit dishes\nbefore they are steamed.\nLotus seeds are referred to by a variety\nof names.  Common ones include Indian\nlotus, hasu, and nelumbium.\nPreparation Tips\nYou can most readily find lotus seeds in\nAsian supermarkets, where they are sold\n338\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nfresh, dried, and canned.  Fresh seeds are\nsold with the seed coat attached or removed,\nbut both types spoil quickly.  The seed coats\nmust be removed before the nut can be\neaten.\nServing Suggestions\nLotus seeds can be eaten raw.  However,\nmost commonly, they are used in cooking.\nOr, they are candied and eaten as a snack or\nadded to pastries as a filling.  In Asian cook-\ning, they may be stewed with poultry, added\nto stir-fry meals, or cooked in water to make\na dessert.\nMacadamia Nut\nNative to Australia, the macadamia tree was\nnamed for the naturalist Dr. John\nMacAdam.  According to legend, he was\nthe first to find the nuts edible.\nThe macadamia nut is enclosed in a\nvery hard, brownish shell, and the kernel\nis off-white in color.  Each nut is about half\nan inch to an inch in diameter and is\nenclosed in a thin, fleshy husk.  This husk\nopens as the nut matures.  The slightly\nMacadamia nuts\nsweet, creamy, rich flavor of the nutmeat\nhas acquired a “gourmet” reputation and a\nhefty asking price.\nMacadamia nuts have the highest fat\nand calorie content of any nut, but they are\nan excellent source of magnesium, copper,\nand thiamin and a good source of iron and\nniacin.  The fat in the macadamia nut is\nprimarily monounsaturated fat.\nThe tree that bears macadamia nuts was\nintroduced to some regions of the United\nStates in the 1880s.  It was not until the\n1930s, however, that a real consumer audi-\nence made the macadamia industry possi-\nble.  Historically, Hawaii has supplied 90\npercent of the world’s macadamia nuts.\nGrowers in California and Florida also have\nbegun contributing to domestic produc-\ntion.  Macadamia nuts are also grown in\nBrazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela,\nJamaica, South Africa, and Samoa. \nPreparation Tips\nBecause of their extremely hard shell (which\ntakes up to 300 pounds of pressure to crack)\nand high oil content, macadamia nuts are\nusually sold shelled in vacuum-packed con-\ntainers.  The nuts can become rancid quick-\nly because of their high oil content.\nRefrigerating them, however, can extend\ntheir shelf life up to 2 months.\nServing Suggestions\nMacadamia nuts may be bought raw or\nroasted, plain, chocolate-covered, or salted,\nand whole or chopped.  They are great by\nthemselves as a snack.  Chopped\nmacadamia nuts add a nice texture and\nflavor to salads, rice dishes, curries, cookies,\ncakes, candies, and ice cream.  The nuts\nalso can be ground into a creamy butter\nand used as a spread.  Oil made from the\nnuts can be added to salads or used for\ncooking.\nHigh-Protein Foods\n339\nPecan Nut\nBelonging to the same family as walnuts,\npecan trees can be found growing wild from\nIllinois to Texas and Maryland to Florida.\nIn fact, more than 100 varieties of pecans\nare cultivated in the United States.\nCommercial cultivation of pecans, however,\nis limited to warm states.  Georgia produces\nmore than a third of the total U.S. pro-\nduction, which totals about 200,000 tons\nof unshelled pecans annually. \nPecans are one of the most widely\ncultivated nuts in the world.  The nut itself\nis elongated and wrinkled, resembling a\nwalnut, and has a buttery flavor.  The shell\nsurrounding pecans is shiny, brown, and\neasily cracked.  Most of the fat in pecans is\nunsaturated.  In addition, pecans are an\nexcellent source of many nutrients, includ-\ning phosphorus, thiamin, copper, and zinc,\nand a good source of iron and potassium.\nMore than half of the fat in pecans is\nmonounsaturated fat.\nPreparation Tips\nUnshelled pecans are most widely available\nduring the autumn months, although pack-\naged, shelled nuts can be found in grocery\nstores year-round.  Tightly wrapped, unshelled\nnuts can be stored in a cool, dry place for up\nto 6 months; shelled nuts can be kept in an air-\ntight container in a freezer for up to 2 years.\nServing Suggestions\nMost people know and love pecan pie, a\nsugary treat popular in the South.  Pecans\ncan be eaten raw or roasted as a snack.  They\nadd a rich flavor to breads, muffins, cakes,\nand other baked goods or can be sprinkled\non cereal or many other types of food.  A\ncandy with Southern roots is pecan praline,\nmade from sugared pecans.  Oil pressed\nfrom pecans may be used for cooking or\nfor salads, but it is expensive.\nPecan nuts\nPecan pie\nPistachio Nut\nPistachio nuts grow in clusters on the pis-\ntachio tree, which grows wild throughout\ncentral and western Asia and is cultivated in\nwarmer areas of the world.\nThe nuts are enclosed in fleshy husks.\nThe nut itself has a hard, thin, tan shell that\npartially splits open when the nut is ripe.\nThe shells may be dyed red or blanched\nwhite by distributors to hide imperfections.\nInside the shell is a smooth, pale-green ker-\nnel wrapped in a fine brownish skin.  This\nkernel has a delicate and sweet flavor, which\nlends itself to desserts. \nShelled and unshelled nuts should be\nkept in an airtight container in the refrig-\nerator, where they will keep for 3 months.\nPistachios are available year-round.\nFrom a nutrition perspective, pistachios\nare an excellent source of iron, magnesium,\nphosphorus, potassium, and thiamin.  The\nmain source of fat in pistachios is monoun-\nsaturated fat.\nPreparation Tips\nPistachios with fully closed shells are imma-\nture and should be avoided.  The nuts can\nbe eaten as a snack either raw or roasted.\nIn addition, they can be added to puddings,\ncakes, candies, and luncheon meats.  Or,\nchopped nuts can be added to stuffing,\npâtés, and sauces.\nPistachio nuts\nSesame seeds\n340\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nkled over the tops of buns.  They are also\nused on bread, rolls, and crackers.  Sesame\nseeds are mainly a condiment in the United\nStates, but they can be added to stews for a\ndelicate, nutlike flavor.  In cuisine of Middle\nEastern countries, sesame seeds are the main\ningredient, along with honey and almonds,\nin a confection called halvah.  Ground\nsesame seeds are also made into butter.  In\nthe Middle East, this is called tahini and is\na popular addition to sauces and main\ndishes.  Chickpeas and tahini can be com-\nbined to make hummus, a popular part of\nMiddle Eastern cuisine. \nSquash Seed\nCultivated worldwide, squash probably was\nfirst gathered by indigenous people around\n8000 B.C., primarily for its seeds.  European\nsettlers arriving in North America found it\nwas a common crop grown by American\nIndians.\nAlthough most people are familiar with\neating the flesh of squash, the seeds of\nsquash by themselves are both tasty and\nnutritious.  The most popular squash seed\neaten in the United States is the pumpkin\nseed, which is flat with one rounded end\nand one end that tapers to a point.  The\nseeds are off-white and approximately\nthree-quarters of an inch long.  They\nenclose a green kernel that is delicately\nnutty in flavor.  In Mexico, pumpkin seeds\nare known as pepitas and are popular in\nmany dishes.\nThe seeds of winter squash are also\ncommonly eaten.  The plants are harvested\nwhen the fruits and, hence, the seeds are\nfully ripe.  Summer squash, in contrast, is\neaten before it and its seeds are fully ripe.\nSeeds from acorn squash, buttercup squash,\nand butternut squash are also edible.  The\nseeds are a healthful addition to your diet,\nServing Suggestions\nIn Asian and Mediterranean cuisine, it is\ncommon to find pistachios in meat and\npoultry dishes as well as in pastries.  Baklava,\nthe popular Middle Eastern dessert made\nwith the thin pastry called filo, contains\npistachios as a main ingredient, along with\nhoney and walnuts. \nSafflower Seed\nThe safflower plant has been cultivated in\nIndia, China, Persia, and Egypt for centuries\nand it was only introduced in the United\nStates in 1925.  India still remains the\nlargest producer of safflower seed.\nCommon names for safflower seeds\ninclude safflower, false saffron, and saffron\nthistle.  Safflower seeds are about a quarter\nof an inch long and elongated.\nThey are an excellent source of iron,\nmagnesium, thiamin, and riboflavin and a\ngood source of potassium and niacin.\nPreparation Tips\nSafflower seeds are enclosed in a fibrous\nseed coat that must be removed before they\ncan be eaten or pressed for oil.  Up to 40\npercent of the weight of the seeds is oil.\nServing Suggestions\nThe seeds of the safflower are eaten fried\nor roasted.  They are one of the primary\ningredients in an Indian dish called chutney.\nThe plant’s shoots are also edible and often\neaten as salad greens.  \nSesame Seed\nSesame seeds are small, oval, and flat and\nhave a paper-thin, edible hull.  They may be\nwhite, yellow, brown, red, or black.\nLighter-colored seeds are considered prefer-\nable to dark seeds. \nSesame seeds are 40 to 60 percent oil\nby weight.  They are an excellent source\nof iron, thiamin, riboflavin, and phos-\nphorus and a good source of potassium.\nPolyunsaturated fat is the primary source\nof fat.\nPreparation Tips\nAvailable hulled, unhulled, or ground,\nsesame seeds have a rich, nutlike flavor\nwhen roasted.

You also can make your own snack\nwhen hollowing out your Halloween jack-\no’-lantern or cooking your winter squash.\nScoop out the seeds, rinse them, dry them,\nand then toast them in the oven until they\nare golden brown.  Soaking them in salt\nwater before baking adds flavor.\nServing Suggestions\nSeeds can be added to salads, sauces, and\npasta dishes to add a crunchy texture or to\nsoups for additional texture.\nSunflower Seed\nWith more than a hundred species, the sun-\nflower genus is thought to be native to\neither western North America or South\nAmerica, although it now grows worldwide.\nThe United States and the former coun-\ntries of the Soviet Union are among the\nlargest producers of sunflower seeds.\nSunflower seeds are about a quarter of\nan inch long, angular, and grayish green,\ntan, or black.  They are enclosed in thin\nshells.  Often, these shells are striped in\nblack and white.  Two main varieties of sun-\nflower are cultivated commercially.  The\nRussian variety is grown mainly for oil\nbecause the seeds contain more than 40\npercent oil by weight.  The North American\nvariety has larger seeds and is grown for\nhuman consumption and for bird food.\nAlthough high in calories and fat, sun-\nflower seeds contain mostly unsaturated\nfat.  In addition, they are a rich source of\nServing Suggestions\nSunflower seeds can be eaten raw, roasted,\nand salted or unsalted and are terrific snacks\nby themselves.  They also are excellent addi-\ntions to salads, stuffing, or yogurt.  Ground\nseeds can be combined with flour to make\nbreads, as is done in Portugal and Russia.\nThe seeds also can be roasted to make a\ncoffee-like drink.  A note to cooks:  the\nseeds may turn green when cooked. \nWalnut\nWalnut is the common name for about 20\nspecies of deciduous trees that include the\nhickory and pecan tree.  The two most\ncommon species are the black walnut and the\nEnglish, also known as the Persian, walnut. \nThe fleshy green fruit of the black\nwalnut encapsulates the nut and cushions\nit when it falls from the tree.  Effort is\nrequired to pry the edible kernel from the\nnut’s thick, woody shell.  The inside of the\nfruit may stain your hands.\nnutrients, including folic acid, niacin, potas-\nsium, and zinc.  They are also high in fiber.\nSunflower seeds are best kept in a cool, dry\nplace.  If shelled, they should be stored in\nthe refrigerator to prevent rancidity.\nPreparation Tips\nSunflower seeds usually are shelled before\nthey are added to dishes.  Shelling by hand\ncan be difficult, although soaking helps.\nMost people simply buy commercially\nshelled sunflower seeds. \n342\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nbe difficult, but commercially shelled\nwalnuts are readily available.  Toasting wal-\nnuts enhances their flavor, helps maintain\ncrispness, and makes them easier to chop.\nServing Suggestions\nWalnuts are a versatile cooking ingredient\nthat can be added to salads, pilafs, cookies,\nmuffins, breads, cakes, and ice cream.\nWhole young nuts can be pickled in vine-\ngar.  Walnuts also can be pressed to make an\noil that is typically used in salads.\nWalnuts also have a variety of nonculi-\nnary uses.

In addition, the husks of English\nwalnuts separate when the fruit is mature,\nallowing the nut to drop out.  Partly for\nthese reasons, the English walnut is the\nmore commercially cultivated species. \nNutritionally, walnuts are an excel-\nlent source of  phosphorus, zinc, copper,\nand thiamin and a good source of iron\nand potassium.

One reason is\nthe mistaken belief that all dairy products\nare high in fat.  Some are, but there is an\nabundance of low-fat and nonfat dairy\nproducts, from milk to yogurt to cheese. \nOther people do not consume dairy\nfoods because of intolerance to milk sugar\nor allergy to milk proteins.  However, those\nwith intolerance to milk often do not need\nto follow a diet that is completely milk-free\n(see sidebar:  Lactose Intolerance, page 347).\nPeople with allergy to milk must avoid dairy\nfoods and may want to get help with adjust-\ning their diets to ensure nutritional ade-\nquacy (see sidebar:  Milk Allergy:  Hidden\nIngredients, page 349).\nM\nilk is a bundle of nutrients, all contained in a nondescript white liquid.\nAlthough milk’s presence as a beverage at meals may not be as popular\nas it used to be, milk is used in many products that are consumed through-\nout the day.\nOn the Food Guide Pyramid, milk and dairy products are placed\nnear the top because, although they are part of a healthful diet, they\nshould be consumed in moderation.  Adults should consume 2 serv-\nings of low-fat or nonfat dairy products daily; \n1 serving equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt or \n1 1/2 ounces of cheese.  Children and\npregnant or lactating women should\nadd an extra serving each day.  Milk\nand other dairy foods are rich in \ncalcium, a mineral important for \ndeveloping strong bones and teeth and for\nnerve transmission.  They are also an important\nsource of many vitamins and minerals.  Large quan-\ntities of these foods, however, are not needed to ensure that\nyou are getting adequate amounts of these nutrients.  Just three\n8-ounce glasses of skim milk, for example, provide nearly all of the\ncalcium you need each day. \nAnother reason people do not consume\ndairy products is the growing consumption\nof soda pop.  The average American drinks\nabout a half gallon of milk a week but, in\ncomparison, about 11 cans — or a gallon\n— of soda pop a week.  Taking calcium sup-\nplements or eating calcium-enriched food\ncan help you obtain needed calcium, but dairy\nfoods are an easy way to get the calcium and\nother essential nutrients you need.\nBasics\nMilk can be consumed in its fluid form, in\na more solid form (such as yogurt), as cheese,\nor as a major ingredient that is added to\nother foods.  Dairy cases now abound with\nmilk-based products and their reduced-fat\nand nonfat versions.  The cornucopia of\ndairy products includes the following:\nFluid milk — Although cow’s milk is\ngenerally consumed in the United States,\nother cultures use milk from goats, camels,\nllamas, reindeer, sheep, and water buffalo.\nMilk is a staple in diets worldwide.\nDried and concentrated milk —\nThese products include powdered milk,\nevaporated milk, and condensed milk.\nCheese — Cheese is made by coagu-\nlating and draining milk or cream or a com-\nbination of both.\nYogurt — Yogurt is made by adding\nbacteria to milk to ferment it. \nIce cream and other dairy desserts —\nIce cream and other frozen desserts are\n346\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nNutrition\nMilk and dairy products provide many of\nthe key nutrients needed daily, particularly\ncalcium (for more specific information, refer\nto milk in the nutrient table on page 472). \nMilk and dairy products also supply\nhigh-quality protein.  Because of its animal\nsource, milk protein is complete — mean-\ning it provides a sufficient amount of the\nnine essential amino acids (see Chapter 2,\nProtein, page 23). \nDairy products are also naturally rich\nin B vitamins and most of the minerals con-\nsidered to be essential in the diet, includ-\ning calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc,\niodine, and selenium.  In addition, milk\nalso contains several vitamins and minerals\nthat have been added to meet the require-\nments of the Food and Drug Administration.\nLow-fat and nonfat milk may be fortified\nwith vitamin A because this fat-soluble\nvitamin is lost when the milk fat is removed.\nVitamin D is added to all milk to help the\nbody better use calcium.\nMilk also is a good source of carbohy-\ndrates.  With the exception of cheeses and\nbutter, milk products are higher in carbo-\nhydrates than protein or fat.  Milk’s carbo-\nhydrate is lactose, a sugar unique to milk\nthat is actually two sugars (glucose and\ngalactose) linked together.  Food scientists\ncall this type of sugar a “disaccharide.”\nLactose is not as sweet as other sugars.\nIt helps the body absorb calcium and phos-\nphorus and may even help in the growth\nof friendly bacteria needed in the intestines.\nIn addition, galactose, one of the sugars in\nlactose, is a vital part of brain and nerve\ntissue.  It is released when the body digests\nlactose.  Lactose is a bit of a paradox, how-\never.  Although it has these beneficial\nproperties, many people have difficulty\ndigesting milk (see sidebar:  Lactose\nIntolerance, page 347).\nPasteurization kills bacteria that have\nbeen responsible for major plagues such as\ntuberculosis, polio, scarlet fever, and typhoid\nfever.  It is also advantageous because it\ndestroys many of the bacteria that cause\nspoilage and many of the enzymes that pro-\nmote rancidity.  Pasteurization, therefore,\nincreases both shelf life and safety of milk.\nA common term that consumers see\nwhen purchasing milk is “homogenized.”\nHomogenization is a process introduced in\nthe 1950s in which fat globules in the milk\nare broken down so they are evenly dis-\npersed throughout the milk.  Most milk at\nthe supermarket is homogenized.\nDuring homogenization, milk is forced\nthrough a small opening at high pressure.\nThe product has a smoother, richer texture\nand a whiter color than nonhomogenized\nmilk.\nsimply milk or cream to which sugar, fla-\nvorings, and, often, eggs have been added. \nCream and sour cream — Cream is the\nfat that rises to the top of the surface in\nunprocessed milk.  Sour cream is simply cream\nthat has been fermented or thickened.  The\ncream is usually “soured” by adding bacteria to\nit, much in the way that yogurt is created.\nButter — This yellowish substance is\nessentially fat that has been separated from\ncream.  For that reason, it is discussed in\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners, page 389. \nProcessing of Milk and Milk Products\nVirtually all milk and milk used in dairy\nproducts is pasteurized.  Pasteurization is\na process invented by French chemist Louis\nPasteur.  It uses heat to destroy harmful\nbacteria in milk, but it retains the nutri-\ntional value of milk.\nThe processing of milk begins at the farm.\nDespite all the nutrients in milk, the\nnutritional advantages of dairy products\nmust be weighed against the potential\nhealth drawbacks of two key components in\nmilk:  sodium and fat.  Whole milk, cream,\nand cheeses contain substantial amounts of\nfat, especially saturated fat.  These fats add\ncalories and have been tied to higher cho-\nlesterol levels and cardiovascular disease (see\nChapter 3, Coronary Artery Disease, page\n61).  However, it is important to note that\nlow-fat and nonfat milk varieties are avail-\nable and are significantly lower in fat than\nwhole milk.  In addition, depending on\nhow much is consumed, milk or products\nmade from milk may be a major source of\nsodium — a special concern for anyone\nfollowing a low-sodium diet.\nDairy Foods\n347\nwrapped, these foods will pick up smells in\nthe refrigerator, possibly leaving them with\nan undesirable taste.\nCheeses such as cottage cheese, ricotta,\nand cream cheese will keep for 1 week after\nthe sell-by date.  Soft cheeses — such as\nBrie, Camembert, Muenster, and mozzarella\n— and blue-vein cheeses can keep from 1\nto 3 weeks.  Semi-firm and hard cheeses,\nsuch as cheddar and Monterey Jack, will\nkeep as long or longer.  Generally, the\nharder the cheese, the longer it will remain\nfresh when carefully stored.\nShredded cheese will not keep as long\nbecause it has more surface exposed to the\nair.  Soft cheese that has mold on it should\nbe discarded.  Firm cheese that has mold can\nsometimes be used as long as 1/2 inch to 1\nSelection\nUnless dried or canned, milk and dairy prod-\nucts are perishable.  For that reason, most\nhave an expiration date printed on the pack-\naging.  The date often states, “Sell by . . .”\nand is a good indicator of freshness.  Look for\nthe date before buying and before consum-\ning a product.  Usually, dairy products will\nkeep about a week beyond that date. \nStorage\nKeep milk in the coldest part of your refrig-\nerator.  Avoid storing milk in the refriger-\nator door unless it has a special compart-\nment designed to keep the milk colder than\nin the rest of the refrigerator.\nKeep yogurt and fresh cheeses in air-\ntight containers in the refrigerator. Loosely\nLACTOSE INTOLERANCE\nAs many as 50 million Americans are estimated to have lactose\nintolerance — an inability to adequately digest ordinary\namounts of dairy products such as milk and ice cream. \nWorldwide, nearly 70 percent of the adult population is\nthought to be lactose intolerant, and the condition is very\ncommon among American Indians and those of Asian,\nAfrican, Hispanic, and Mediterranean descent. \nLactose is the sugar that is naturally present in milk and\nmilk products.  It must be broken down by lactase (an enzyme\nfound in the intestine) before the body can use it.  If there is\nnot enough lactase, undigested milk sugar remains in the\nintestine.  Bacteria in the colon then ferment this sugar.  \nGas, cramping, and diarrhea can follow. \nMost of us begin to lose intestinal lactase as we age.\nHowever, this occurs to varying degrees.  Thus, people with\nlactase deficiency vary in their ability to comfortably digest\nmilk and milk products. \nAs obvious as the symptoms of lactose intolerance may be,\nit is not easily diagnosed from the symptoms alone.  Many\nother conditions, including stomach flu and irritable bowel\nsyndrome, can cause similar symptoms. \nSee your physician to determine whether you are lactose\nintolerant.  Measurement of the hydrogen in your breath\nafter you have taken in lactose is a useful test because large\namounts of hydrogen indicate that lactose is not being fully\ndigested and that you are probably intolerant. \nPersons with milk allergies should avoid milk, but those\nwith lactose intolerance often do not need to follow a diet that\nis completely lactose-free.  The following suggestions may help:\n•\nAvoid eating or drinking large servings of dairy products\nat one time.  (Several smaller servings over the course of a\nfew hours are much easier to digest.)\n•\nDrink milk or eat dairy products with a meal.\n•\nChoose hard or aged cheeses, such as Swiss or cheddar,\nover fresh varieties.  Hard cheeses have smaller amounts \nof lactose and are more likely to be tolerated.\n•\nTake lactase tablets or drops, such as Lactaid or Dairy\nEase.  These types of products contain the enzyme that breaks\ndown lactose, reducing the amount that your body must\ndigest on its own. \nFor help with meal planning, you may want to see a\nregistered dietitian.\ninch of cheese near the molded spot has been\ncut away and discarded.  If any milk or milk\nproduct has a strange odor, throw it out. \nSafety Issues\nSome small markets or independent farm-\ners still sell raw milk.  Because it has not\nbeen pasteurized, this milk may contain\ngerms that make you ill.  For that reason,\nthe sale of raw milk is often prohibited by\nlaw, depending on location.  \nFor some people, proteins in cow’s milk\nmay trigger allergic reactions.  Whey pro-\nteins (beta-lactoglobulin and beta-lact-\nalbumin) and casein are the primary pro-\nteins that trigger allergic reactions.\nSymptoms of a milk allergy may include\nnasal congestion, hives, itching, swelling,\nwheezing, shortness of breath, nausea, upset\nReduced-fat milk — Often referred to\nas two percent, this type of milk has had\nsome milk fat removed from it.  Two per-\ncent reflects the amount of fat in the milk by\nweight.  It does not refer to the percentage\nof calories from fat.  One cup of 2 percent\nmilk has 130 calories and 5 grams of fat.\nLow-fat milk — Also known as 1 per-\ncent milk, this type of milk contains about\n100 calories and 2.6 grams of fat in 1 cup. \nNonfat or skim milk — Skim milk,\nwhich contains less than 0.5 percent milk\nfat, is now more often labeled nonfat milk.\nIt contains the same amount of nutrients,\nsuch as calcium, as its higher fat counter-\nparts, but it has no fat and just 90 calories.\nButtermilk — Buttermilk was once the\nresidue left from churning butter, but\ntoday’s version is made from adding a lactic\nacid culture to milk.  The result is far less\nrich than the original “natural” buttermilk,\nbut it still retains the thick texture and\nacidic tang of old.  Some manufacturers\nadd flecks of butter for an authentic look\nor stabilizers to prevent separation.  Because\nof its name, buttermilk may sound high\nin fat.  Yet, in most instances it is not.\nButtermilk derives its fat content from the\nmilk used to make it, and in the United\nStates low-fat or nonfat milk is used most\noften.  Calories and fat in buttermilk\ndepend on what type of milk was used to\nmake it.  Check the label for fat content.\nAcidophilus milk — Normally killed\nduring pasteurization, the healthy bacteria\nculture Lactobacillus acidophilus is reintro-\nduced into whole, low-fat, or nonfat milk\nto create sweet acidophilus milk.  In a/B\nmilk, both acidophilus and bifidobacteria\ncultures are added.  Acidophilus occurs\nnaturally in the body and is found mainly\nin the small intestine.  Many factors can\nalter the level of this intestinal bacterium,\nincluding diet, alcohol consumption, illness,\n348\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nstomach, cramps, heartburn, gas or diarrhea,\nlight-headedness, and fainting.\nIt is easy to confuse a milk allergy with\nanother common health concern related to\ndairy foods — lactose intolerance.  Lactose\nintolerance (see page 347) also can lead to\nnausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea.\nHowever, if you have lactose intolerance,\nyou usually can eat small amounts of dairy\nfood without problems.  In contrast, a tiny\namount of a food to which you are allergic\ncan trigger a reaction.\nIf you suspect that you have any food\nallergies, see your physician.  You may then\nbe referred to an allergist for a careful eval-\nuation.  This generally includes a medical\nhistory, physical examination, and skin or\nblood testing.  If the diagnosis is a milk aller-\ngy, it is essential to eliminate milk and foods\nmade with milk from your diet (see sidebar:\nMilk Allergy:  Hidden Ingredients, page 349). \nMilk\nMilk has a wide variety of uses and thus is\none of the most basic items found in\nkitchens worldwide.  It is consumed as a\nbeverage, poured on cereals, and used in\nmany different ways in cooking.  In response\nto consumers with different nutritional\ndemands, modern food science has made\nmany different types of fluid milk available.\nAlthough milk can be less inviting to\npeople who are concerned with their weight\nbecause of its high fat content, some types\nof milk contain no fat at all.\nWhole milk — Containing 3 1/2 per-\ncent milk fat, this type of milk is often sim-\nply labeled “milk” or “vitamin D milk” if\nthat particular vitamin has been added.  Of\nall types of milk, whole milk is among the\nhighest in fat and calories.  One cup has 150\ncalories and approximately 8 grams of fat. \nand medications.  Alterations in levels can\nsometimes lead to poor digestion, diarrhea,\nand bloating.  Drinking acidophilus milk\nproducts may reduce intestinal infection\nand diarrhea and improve milk digestion\nand tolerance.  Studies are under way to\nevaluate whether these bacteria can help\nregulate blood cholesterol levels and prevent\ncancer.  Calories and fat in acidophilus milk\ndepend on what type of milk was cultured\nwith the acidophilus bacterium.  If whole\nmilk was used, for example, acidophilus-\ntreated milk contains the same amount of\nfat and calories as whole milk. \nLactose-reduced and lactose-free milk —\nThese products are tailored to people who\nhave trouble digesting lactose, a sugar\nfound in milk.  An enzyme called lactase\nis added during the processing of this milk.\nThe result is that lactose in the milk is\nreduced by at least 70 percent (lactose-\nreduced) or up to 99.9 percent (lactose-free).\nCalories and fat in lactose-reduced and lac-\ntose-free milk depend on what type of milk\nwas cultured.  \nDairy Foods\n349\nFlavored milks are higher in calories than\ntheir unflavored counterparts.  Calories and\nfat in flavored milk range from 150 calories\nand no fat for 1 cup of chocolate milk made\nfrom skim milk to more than 210 calories\nand 8 grams of fat for 1 cup of whole\nchocolate milk.  When purchasing flavored\nmilks, look for products that are made from\nskim or reduced-fat milk.  Avoid those\nlabeled “premium.”  They often are made\nfrom whole milk, which is high in fat.\nPreparation Tips\nIt is easy to overcook milk when heating it.\nWhen milk is heated to a temperature that\nis too high, its proteins clump together and\ncurds appear in the milk.  When heating\nmilk, always use low heat and stir frequently.\nUsing a double boiler when heating milk\nalso helps prevent overheating. \nAnyone who has ever had homemade\nhot cocoa knows that heated milk can\ndevelop a “skin” (a thickened surface).  An\neasy way to prevent this is to mix a little\ncornstarch into the milk before heating it.\nUltrapasteurized milk (UHT) — This\nmilk has been popular in Europe for many\nyears, but it has only recently appeared in\nU.S. supermarkets.  The “ultra-heat treat-\nment” (UHT) sterilizes milk by quickly\nheating it, sometimes as high as 300 degrees\nFahrenheit, and then quickly cooling it\nbefore packaging it in vacuum-packed, asep-\ntic containers.  UHT milk can be stored\nfor 2 to 3 months without refrigeration,\nuntil opened.  Once opened, UHT milk\nshould be refrigerated and quickly con-\nsumed.  It can spoil, but unlike other milk,\nit does not curdle as a warning sign of\nspoilage.  The ultra-heat process makes the\nmilk taste slightly scalded, but it is thought\nthat the treatment does not substantially\naffect the nutrient value.  The amount of\nfat and calories in UHT milk depends on\nthe type of milk from which it was made.\nFlavored milk — Flavorings, sugar, or\nother sweeteners are added to fluid milk.\nAlthough some milk is flavored with straw-\nberry, vanilla, and even peanut butter\nflavorings, chocolate is used most commonly.\nIf you are allergic to milk, it is impor-\ntant to check the labels of the foods\nyou eat.  Milk or components of milk\nare common ingredients in many dif-\nferent foods, some of which you might\nnot be aware of. \nFoods that likely contain milk\ninclude the following:\n•\nButter, including artificial butter\nflavor, butter fat, ghee, buttermilk \n•\nChocolate, caramel, nougat\n•\nCheese, including cream cheese,\ncottage cheese, and cheese curds\n•\nSimplesse (a fat substitute)\n•\nLuncheon meats, hot dogs, and\nsausages\n•\nCream, including half-and-half,\nnondairy creamers (containing casein)\n•\nMargarine\n•\nYogurt\n•\nSo-called nondairy items, including\ncoffee lighteners, whipped toppings,\nimitation cheeses, and frozen or soft-\nserve dessert items.  These may contain\ncasein, a milk protein. \nIngredients on the label that indi-\ncate milk or a dairy product is in the\nproduct include the following:\n•\nLactalbumin\n•\nLactoglobulin\n•\nRennet casein\n•\nLactose\n•\nCasein\n•\nHydrolysates (casein hydrolysates,\nmilk protein hydrolysates, protein\nhydrolysates, whey or whey protein\nhydrolysates)\n•\nEvaporated, dry, or milk solids\n•\nWhey\n•\nSo-called natural flavorings (check\nwith manufacturer for more informa-\ntion)\nMILK ALLERGY:  HIDDEN INGREDIENTS\n350\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nmilk forms of powdered milk are good for\nup to 6 months.  Reseal opened packages\nand store in a cool, dark, and dry place to\nprevent the product from absorbing\nmoisture in the air.  All opened packages\nand skim milk, and eventually only skim\nmilk.  If you dislike skim milk, 1 percent\nor 2 percent milk is a reasonable option,\nespecially if it keeps you drinking milk.\nButtermilk can be substituted for cream\nin many recipes:  a half cup of buttermilk\nhas 1 gram of fat, but the same serving of\nlight cream has 31 grams.\nWhenever possible, lower the amount\nof fat in a recipe by substituting a lower-\nfat milk.  A cream soup made with low-fat\nmilk is just as rich tasting, especially if you\nthicken the soup with a bit of flour.  A cup\nof cocoa made with skim milk provides\nmore nutrients and fewer calories than the\naverage chocolate dessert, and it is just as\neffective for satisfying a sweet tooth. \nDried & Concentrated\nMilks\nDried and concentrated milks offer conve-\nnience and increased shelf life.  Such prod-\nucts also can be used in numerous recipes\nto give the taste of milk without all the water\nvolume of fluid milk.  Dried and concen-\ntrated milk products include the following:\nPowdered milk — As its name sug-\ngests, powdered milk is milk that has had\nnearly all the water removed from it.\nMixing it with water (follow package direc-\ntions) results in fluid milk.  Powdered milk\nis usually made from skim milk because\nhaving less fat helps the product resist ran-\ncidity.  Recipes sometimes call for powdered\nmilk to thicken sauces or to add calcium\nand protein to foods.  Powdered milk does\nnot taste like fresh milk.  However, its\nstability and portability make it a frequent\ningredient in convenience foods or\nprepared mixes.  These qualities also make\nit an excellent choice for travelers.  Opened\npackages of low-fat, nonfat, and butter-\nServing Suggestions\nNonfat milk has the least amount of fat and\ncalories but still provides all of milk’s nutri-\nents.  Many people prefer its lighter texture\nand taste to the heaviness of whole milk.\nEven the staunchest fan of whole milk can\neasily be converted to using this healthier\nalternative.  Make the change gradually.\nStart by mixing equal parts of whole milk\nwith 2 percent milk.  Then, in stepwise pro-\ngression, use just 2 percent, next a combi-\nnation of 2 percent and 1 percent, then just\n1 percent, then a combination of 1 percent\nSELECTING MILK FOR\nCHILDREN\nMilk recommendations for children\nolder than 1 year are a practical\nconcern for parents.  Can everyone\nin the family drink the same milk, \nor should you buy certain milk for\nonly the youngest members? \nBreast milk, of course, is recom-\nmended during the first year of life.\nIf the infant is weaned during the\nfirst year, the best alternative is to use\niron-fortified formula.  Formula-fed\ninfants should remain on iron-forti-\nfied formula until 1 year of age.\nAfter age 1, the American Academy\nof Pediatrics recommends using\nwhole milk if the use of breast milk\nor formula is discontinued.  Until\nage 2, fat should not be limited in \nan infant’s diet.  \nAfter age 2 years, children can\nbegin to consume fat in moderation,\njust as the rest of the family does.\nHowever, whether to use low-fat\nmilk will vary for each child.  If a\nchild has had poor growth or a\nchronic medical condition, discuss\nthe appropriate fat content of milk\n— and diet in general — with the\nchild’s physician.  For otherwise\nhealthy children older than 2 years,\nlow-fat milk (skim, 1 percent, or \n2 percent) is fine — and it means\nyou have to buy only one type of\nmilk for the entire family. \nSOY AND RICE “MILK”\nNondairy beverages made from soy-\nbeans and rice are available for\npersons who have milk allergies, are\nlactose-intolerant, or prefer not to\neat animal products.  Both soy milk\nand rice milk are similar in look and\ntaste to milk and can be used for\nmany of the same purposes, such \nas pouring on cereal or making\nsmoothies and other dairy-based\nbeverages. \nSoymilk is made from water,\nsoybeans, malted corn and barley\nextract, seaweed (used for thickening\npurposes), salt, and, depending on\nthe brand, a fat or oil.  Rice milk is\nmade from water, brown rice, salt,\nand, depending on the brand, saf-\nflower oil and various vitamins and\nminerals.  Soy and rice milks have\nfewer calories and less fat than whole\nmilk, but they have more of both\nthan skim milk.  One cup of soymilk\nhas about 135 calories and 5 grams\nof fat.  One cup of rice milk has\nabout 120 calories and 2 grams of fat. \nof dried milk keep better in the refrigerator\nbecause temperature and humidity are\nbetter controlled. \nEvaporated milk — Packaged in sealed\ncans, evaporated milk is milk from which\nabout 60 percent of water has been evapo-\nrated.  The milk is homogenized and packed\nin heat-sterilized cans that help extend shelf\nlife.  Unopened cans can be stored at room\ntemperature for up to 6 months but should\nbe refrigerated and used within 5 days after\nbeing opened.  Evaporated milk has a\nslightly darker color than regular milk\nbecause it was heated during the evapora-\ntion process.\nSweetened condensed milk — Thick\nand sold in sealed cans, condensed milk is\noften used to make desserts because it is\nusually sweetened.  Like evaporated milk,\nmore than half of the water in sweetened\ncondensed milk is removed by heating it.\nUp to 40 to 45 percent of this product by\nweight is sugar.  In its undiluted form,\nsweetened condensed milk contains nearly\n13 tablespoons of sugar and 1,000 calories\nper cup.  For that reason, it is best to eat\nsmall servings of desserts and dishes made\nwith this ingredient. \nPreparation Tips\nDry milk can be reconstituted according\nto package directions, or it can be mixed\nwith cool water in a blender for a more\npleasing consistency.  When using sweet-\nened condensed milk, cut down on the\namount of other sugar you use in the recipe\nto save on calories. \nServing Suggestions\nNonfat dry milk can add a boost of calcium\nto recipes for meatloaf, hot cereal, gravy, or\ncanned cream soups.  A tablespoon contains\nDairy Foods\n351\ncially made cream.  Many types of cream\nare sold:  \nHeavy cream and light whipping cream —\nHeavy cream has between 36 and 40 per-\ncent milk fat by weight.  The thickest of\nthe “sweet creams,” heavy cream is used\nmainly for whipping cream and for desserts.\nA lower-fat version, with 30 to 36 percent\nmilk fat, is called light whipping cream.\nFor this cream to whip properly, emulsi-\nfiers and stabilizers are added to the cream.\nBoth products double in volume when\nwhipped.  For this reason, whipping cream\nis also called double cream.\nLight cream — Light cream contains\n18 to 30 percent milk fat by weight and\ncannot be whipped.  Instead of doubling\nin size, it remains the same volume.  Hence,\nit is called single cream.  Other names for\n94 milligrams of calcium but adds only 27\ncalories.  Many brands are fortified with\nvitamins A and D for a nutrient bonus. \nEvaporated milk often is used in soups\nand sauces for a smooth, creamy texture.\nWell chilled, it also can be whipped and\nused as a dessert topping with only a tenth\nof the calories of heavy whipped cream.\nCream and Sour Cream\nCream is made from milk fat.  It is extremely\nhigh in fat and calories, but it creates the\ncreamy, rich, indulgent taste in desserts and\nsauces.\nA century ago, cream was skimmed\nfrom the top of milk that was set in a cool\nplace.  Today, machines separate commer-\nlight cream include table cream or coffee\ncream, because it is often the cream used\nto fill coffee creamers.\nHalf-and-half — This is a mixture of\nequal parts of whole milk and light cream,\nhomogenized to prevent separation.  It con-\ntains from 10 to 12 percent milk fat by\nweight and can be substituted in many\nrecipes calling for cream.  The product cuts\ncalories and fat, but it lacks some of the\nvelvety qualities of heavy or light cream.\nHalf-and-half commonly is added to\ncoffee, although a far healthier alternative\nis skim milk.\nSour cream — Real sour cream con-\ntains 18 to 20 percent milk fat by weight.\nIt is created commercially by introducing\na bacterial culture to cream that converts\nthe milk’s sugar, lactose, into lactic acid.\nThe acid gives sour cream its distinctive,\ntangy flavor.  Stabilizers such as sodium\nalginate, carrageenan, locust bean gum, or\n352\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\ngelatin are sometimes added to make sour\ncream thick and smooth, and rennet and\nnonfat milk solids are added to give it more\nbody.  Low-fat and light sour creams are\nboth made with half-and-half according to\nthe same process to create a similar product\nwith 60 percent less fat than regular sour\ncream.  Fat-free sour cream substitute is\nmade with the same process, and skim milk\nis used as the base.\nNondairy creamers and toppings —\nThese imitation dairy products sometimes\ncontain coconut oil, palm kernel oil, or\nother highly saturated and hydrogenated\nvegetable oils mixed with casein (a milk\nprotein) and lactose (a milk sugar).  These\ningredients create a high level of saturated\nfat without providing any of the vitamins\nand minerals found in milk or cream.  Fat-\nfree and sugar-free versions of regular coffee\ncreamers, lighteners, and nondairy whipped\ntoppings have various amounts of sugars\nand fats.  Pressurized whipped cream,\npacked in cans under pressure, uses gas to\nexpand the cream.  Aerosol dessert toppings\ndo not contain any milk or cream.\nPreparation Tips\nBecause cream is highly perishable, it should\nbe stored in the coolest part of the refrig-\nerator and used quickly.  To whip cream,\nchill the cream thoroughly and place the\nbeaters and bowl in the freezer for 10 min-\nutes before whipping.  Whip at medium\nspeed until the cream thickens.\nWHAT GOES INTO YOUR COFFEE COUNTS\nWhat goes into the brew you purchase at your local espresso bar matters.  For example,\nhere’s how your choice of milk affects two popular espresso-based beverages:\nLatte (12 ounces)\nCalories\nFat (grams)\nCarbohydrates (grams)\nMade with whole milk\n190 \n11\n14\nMade with skim milk\n95\n0\n14\nCappuccino (12 ounces)\nMade with whole milk\n155\n9\n11\nMade with skim milk\n55\n0\n9\nServing Suggestions\nAlthough air is added to whipped cream,\na dollop atop a special treat adds extra fat\n(mostly saturated):  about 3 grams for 1/4\ncup.  Cream sauces served over pasta are\nalso high in fat.  Instead, try a vegetable-\nrich marinara sauce.  Substitute a lower-fat\nversion of cream in recipes when possible,\nor use milk or yogurt.  For recipes calling for\nsour cream, try buttermilk or yogurt.\nDairy Foods\n353\nAfrican camel’s milk, or the Middle Eastern\newe’s milk is unknown and still debated.\nBut the results, after thousands of years,\nremain the same:  the earliest coagulating\ncurds of milk carried in a shepherd’s pouch\nhave become a tempting treat, with many\ndifferent types from which to choose.\nCheese can be made from various milks.\nMilk from cows is typically used in the\nUnited States, but milk from sheep, goats,\ncamels, and other animals is used worldwide.\nIn fact, some of the world’s finest gourmet\ncheeses are made from sheep’s milk.\nNo matter what type of milk is used, the\nprocess is essentially the same.  The first step\nis to curdle the milk, essentially causing pro-\nteins in the milk to clump.  Bacterial cul-\ntures or certain enzymes are used to curdle\nthe milk.  Next, the liquid surrounding the\ncurds, which is called the whey, is drained.\nIf substitutions leave you yearning for\nthe real thing, or if you eat more of the\nlower-fat item than you would have eaten\nof the higher-fat ingredient, you may want\nto stick to the recipe and eat a smaller serv-\ning as an occasional indulgence.\nCheese\nDespite the high fat content of most forms\nof cheese, cheese remains an American\nfavorite.  Dairy cases are filled with different\nvarieties of cheeses, and classic foods such\nas pizza, cheeseburgers, and tacos, all of\nwhich use some form of cheese, guarantee\ngenerations of cheese lovers.\nThe first cheese was said to have devel-\noped by accident, when milk was allowed\nto ferment.  Whether the first cheese was\nformed from Mongolian yak’s milk, the\nCREAM GLOSSARY\nChantilly cream — Named for\nthe place in France where it is\nbelieved to have originated, chantilly\ncream is made simply by adding\nsugar and vanilla to whipped cream.\nClotted cream (also called\nDevonshire cream) — A sour cream\nthat originated in Devonshire,\nEngland, clotted cream is thicker\nthan regular sour cream.  After being\nheated and cooled, the cream is\nskimmed and then eaten on scones\nwith jam.\nCrème fraîche — A product that\nfalls between fresh cream and sour\ncream, crème fraîche is used often in\nFrench cooking, in which it is served\nlightly whipped and sweetened.  It is\nmade by adding a small amount of\nbuttermilk to cream and heating the\nmixture.  It is then stored in a warm\nplace until it thickens.  This usually\ntakes between 12 and 36 hours.  The\nmixture is then refrigerated and can\nbe kept up to a week.\nSmetana — A dense Russian sour\ncream, smetana is traditionally served\non borscht and salads.  It is also\nknown by the names smitane,\nsmatana, or sliuki.\nThen the curds are pressed into shapes.\nSalt may be added at this point.  The freshly\nmade cheese is then allowed to age, a\nprocess that develops its flavor.  Other ingre-\ndients also may be added at this point.  In\ngeneral, 11 pounds of milk are needed to\nmake 1 pound of cheese.  Knowing that, it\nis easy to see why cheese is dense in both\ncalories and fat.\nLike any dairy product, cheese is per-\nishable.  A general rule is that the harder\nthe cheese, the longer it keeps.  Categories\nof cheese are determined by the method\nused to make it, the type of milk used, the\ntexture, or even the appearance of the rind.\nThis classification system groups cheeses\nwith common characteristics.\n354\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nsteps from milk.  It is essentially the sepa-\nration of milk into curds and whey.  The\ncurds are partially drained before cottage\ncheese is packaged and sold. \nCream cheese — The mild white spread\noften used for bagels, cream cheese is a\nbetter choice than butter, but it still has a lot\nof fat.  Up to 90 percent of the calories in\ncream cheese are from fat.  One tablespoon\nhas about 50 calories and about 5 grams of\nfat.  Even reduced-fat cream cheese is high\nin fat, with up to 75 percent of calories\nfrom fat.  From a calorie and fat standpoint,\nfat-free cream cheeses are the best choice.\nFarmer’s cheese — Often used in bak-\ning, farmer’s cheese is essentially cottage\ncheese that has had most of the liquid\nFresh Cheeses\nThese cheeses were once made on the farm\nfrom surplus cream and quickly served.\nToday these cheeses are made with pas-\nteurized milk, but they still have a short\nshelf life and must be consumed quickly.\nFresh cheeses are not allowed to ripen or\nferment very long, so they have a high mois-\nture content, a mild flavor, and a smooth,\ncreamy texture.  They generally keep for 1\nweek after purchase or the “use by” date.\nCommon types of fresh cheeses include\nthe following: \nCottage cheese — Usually thought of as\na “diet” food, cottage cheese is a healthful\nfood choice when it is made from skim or\nlow-fat milk.  Cottage cheese is only a few\nFresh mozzarella cheese, tomato,\nand basil on crackers.\npressed out of it.  It is usually sold formed\nas a loaf and is relatively low in fat. \nMozzarella — The pizza topping of\nchoice, mozzarella is a soft, bland cheese.\nUnlike other fresh cheeses, mozzarella has\nundergone a heating and kneading process.\nWhole-fat, skim, low-moisture, and fat-\nfree versions of mozzarella cheese are avail-\nable.  Fresh mozzarella, sold in specialty\nand ethnic stores, is usually made from\nwhole milk and, therefore, is higher in fat\nthan other types.\nRicotta — A common ingredient in\nItalian dishes, ricotta is similar to cottage\ncheese but has a finer texture.  Ricotta was\nonce made from whey left over from mak-\ning other cheeses.  Today, it is made from\nwhey and milk. \nSemisoft Cheeses  \nSemisoft cheeses are firm on the outside yet\nsoft and moist on the inside.  Because they\nare aged for just a few weeks, they have a\nsoft, moist texture and mild flavor. \nSemisoft cheeses are used widely in\ncooking because they melt smoothly and\neasily.  They are also easy to slice and so are\nexcellent for hors d’oeuvres or for more\nordinary uses, such as sandwich toppings. \nBecause these cheeses are soft, they are\noften coated with wax or another material\nto keep them intact.  Some types of semi-\nsoft cheeses are aged.  Others are “washed”\nin brine, which causes them to develop a\nrind on the outside.  These processes also\nintensify the cheese’s flavor and, in some\ninstances, sodium content.\nSome common types of semisoft cheeses\ninclude:\nBrick — The shape of this cheese is the\norigin of its name.  When aged, it has an\nassertive flavor, like cheddar cheese.  When\nit is young, it is mild.\nDairy Foods\n355\nily sliced and can add a different twist to ordi-\nnary foods, such as sandwiches.\nProvolone — The taste of this cheese\ndepends on its age and how it is processed.\nYoung provolone has a mild taste and ivory\ncolor.  With age, its flavor becomes stronger,\nits texture drier, and its color darker.  The\ncheese is sometimes smoked or has had a\nsmoke flavoring added to it.  Provolone is\noften sold in loaves.\nSemisoft cheeses are generally higher in\ncalories and fat than soft cheeses.  For exam-\nple, 1 1/2 ounces of Edam or provolone\ncheese has about 150 calories and about 12\ngrams of fat.  In contrast, the same amount\nof cottage cheese (made with 2 percent\nmilk) contains about 40 calories and 1 gram\nEdam — A Dutch specialty, this cheese\nhas a mild, buttery taste.  It is often sold in\nballs or blocks coated with red wax.  It is\nalso available smoked.\nGouda — Another Dutch cheese,\nGouda is sold in wedges and wheels usual-\nly covered in red wax.  Like other semisoft\ncheeses, it has a mild flavor that becomes\nsharper as it ages.  Gouda can be purchased\nas a smoked cheese.\nJarlsberg — A Norwegian specialty, this\ncheese is often compared to Swiss cheese.\nIt is softer, however, and milder.  Jarlsberg\nis also typically sold in wedges.\nLimburger — Famed for its character-\nistic aroma, Limburger is one of the strongest-\nflavored semisoft cheeses.  Limburger is eas-\nGOAT CHEESES\nGoat’s milk has a little more\ncalcium than cow’s milk but it\nis deficient in vitamin B12 and\nfolate.  Goat’s milk has smaller\nfat globules than cow’s milk,\nso it does not need to be\nhomogenized.  However, it\ndoes need to be pasteurized for\nthe same reasons cow’s milk\nshould — to kill any germs\nthat might be harmful \nto humans.\nGoat’s milk is not an acceptable alternative for persons who are lactose-intoler-\nant, because it contains lactose in the same percentage as cow’s milk.  Nor is goat’s\nmilk or goat cheese a lower-fat alternative.  Some people prefer the taste and\ntexture of goat cheese, but 1 1/2 ounces of hard goat cheese has 13 grams of fat —\nabout the same as cheese made from whole cow's milk, such as cheddar. \nSoft goat cheeses such as Montrachet and some types of feta — a salty, white\ncheese originating in Greece which can be made with goat or sheep’s milk — \ncontain more moisture and are comparable to cheeses made from part-skim cow’s\nmilk.  One and one-half ounces of feta cheese has 9 grams of fat, about the same\namount as in an equal amount of mozzarella or Neufchâtel cheese.\n356\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nHard and Firm Cheeses\nThis category is what most people think of\nwhen it comes to cheese.  So-named because\nthey become hardened with age, hard and\nfirm cheeses include the well-known cheddar\nand Parmesan varieties.  They have a strong\nflavor and are widely used in cooking.  They\nare also richer in calcium than softer cheeses\nbecause more milk is used in their produc-\ntion.  However, this also means they are\nhigher in fat and calories and so should be\nused in moderation in a healthful diet.\nHard and firm cheeses are divided into\nthese categories:\nHard grating cheeses — Hard grating\ncheeses include Parmesan and Romano.  As\nthe name suggests, they are often grated\nbefore use, but they can be served as\nchunks.  Both cheeses originated in Italy.\nParmesan cheese takes its name from the\nParma region, where this cheese may be\naged up to 4 years.  Romano cheese prob-\nably originated in Rome.  Italian versions\nare made from sheep’s milk; American ver-\nsions, in contrast, are made from cow’s milk.\nBoth types are common toppings for Italian\nfavorites such as spaghetti.  In general, these\ncheeses have a tangy flavor and pleasing\naroma.  During production, they are heat-\ned to set the curd and reduce moisture.\nAging enhances their flavor and results in\ntheir texture becoming more crumbly.\nCheddar-type cheeses — Cheddar\ncheese originated in the English village of\nCheddar and has since been adopted by\ncheese lovers all over the world.  Cheddar’s\ndistinct bite can range from mild to sharp,\nand the cheese is often seasoned with wine\nor spices.  Cheddar cheese’s characteristic\ncolor is orange — the result of adding a\nnatural vegetable coloring called annatto\nduring production.  Other cheddar-type\ncheeses include Cantal, Cheshire, Gloucester,\nWensleydale, and Leicester. \ntain a soft, butter-like consistency at matu-\nrity.  These cheeses garner their characteris-\ntic flavor from bacteria that grow on the out-\nside and move inward.  The result is a rich,\ncreamy texture and full flavor.  These cheeses\noften have fewer calories than hard cheeses.\nSoft, white-rind cheeses include:\nBrie — A cheese originating in northern\nFrance, Brie is often sold in wedges and has\na tangy, buttery flavor.\nCamembert — Also originating in\nnorthern France, Camembert has a velvety\ntexture and a soft, light-yellow interior.\nCamembert is often wrapped in foil and\nsold in wooden boxes.\nBlue or Blue-Veined Cheeses\nBlue-veined cheeses are created by the intro-\nduction of a blue mold into the milk before\nit thickens.  The blue color, however, would\nnot appear as the characteristic blue-green\nveins in cheeses without exposure to air.\nTherefore, the cheese is pierced with steel\nrods to let air circulate. \nMost blue cheeses are made in the style\nof classic European blue cheeses.  They can\nbe firm or creamy and any color from\nchalk-white to golden-yellow.  The flavor\nof these cheeses grows stronger with age.\nAlthough these cheeses are high in fat, only\na small amount is typically used because of\ntheir strong flavor.  Blue cheeses keep for\n1 to 4 weeks after purchase.\nClassic or blue-veined cheeses include:\nGorgonzola — Sold in wheels,\nGorgonzola is an Italian specialty.  The\ninterior of the cheese is white with veins\nthat are usually more green than blue. \nRoquefort — Named for the area in\nFrance where the cheese is said to have\noriginated, Roquefort has a crumbly tex-\nture and a sharp flavor.  It is made from\nsheep’s milk.\nof fat.  However, semisoft cheeses general-\nly contain less fat and calories than hard\ncheeses because less milk is used to make\nsemisoft cheeses than hard cheeses. \nSoft, White-Rind Cheeses\nSoft, white-rind cheeses are descendents of\nnatural-rind cheeses, in which gray, green,\nand even red molds are allowed to grow on\nthe surface of the cheese as it ripens.  Most\nNorth American cheese consumers are put\noff by the colored mold growth, so the\ncolorful natural-rind cheeses are nearly\nimpossible to obtain outside of France.\nSoft, white-rind cheeses are readily avail-\nable, however.  Instead of allowing natural\nmold growth, these cheeses are sprayed with\nwhite mold spores that seal the outside while\nallowing the interior of the cheese to main-\nREDUCED-FAT AND IMITATION\nCHEESES\nReduced-fat cheese usually is made\nfrom nonfat milk, but additives are\nneeded to create the creamy texture\nof full-fat versions.  Imitation cheese\ndoes not necessarily mean the\nproduct contains no milk: it may \nuse casein (a milk protein) and \nemulsifiers, enzymes, and artificial\nflavorings and colors.  Other imita-\ntion cheeses are made from soybean\nderivatives.  Both reduced-fat and\nimitation cheeses can be used as you\nwould use regular cheese if you do\nnot plan to cook the cheese.  Both\nreduced-fat and imitation cheeses\ntend to have a denser, more rubbery\ntexture when heated and may not melt\nin the way traditional cheese does.\nDairy Foods\n357\nColby — A blander, more moist cheese\nthan cheddar, Colby was developed in\nWisconsin a century ago.\nGruyère-type cheeses — Carbon diox-\nide gases trapped inside the cheese while it\nis ripening create the characteristic “eyes”\nof this type of cheese.  The cheese usually\nis a straw-yellow color and has a mild to\nrich, full flavor. \nMonterey Jack — A mild, light-colored\ncheese, Monterey Jack also may be spiced\nup with bits of jalapeno peppers, pepper-\noni, or herbs and spices.\nSwiss cheese — Known for the holes\nin it, Swiss cheese is a golden-yellow cheese\nand has a  tangy flavor.  The holes in it are\ncaused by pockets of gas that develop when\nthe cheese is made.\nProcessed Cheeses\nProcessed cheese is the most common type\nof cheese eaten in the United States, where\nit was originally developed.  In processed\ncheese, one or more types of cheese are\nheated (which stops the aging process) and\nmelted.  An emulsifier is then added as a\nbinding agent.  Additional dairy ingredi-\nents may be added, such as cream, whole\nor skim milk, buttermilk, or dried milk.\nDepending on the process, other thick-\neners or emulsifiers may be added for\nfirmness and smoothness.  A common\ntype of processed cheese is American\ncheese, which is usually derived from\ncheddar cheese.\nProcessed cheeses have a mild flavor and\nmelt easily and smoothly.  They have a\nnumber of uses, from spreads to pasta top-\npings to dips.  However, there are nutri-\ntional trade-offs.  Processed cheeses are often\nhigher in sodium than traditional cheeses\nand are somewhat lower in protein and\nother nutrients.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) closely regulates the composition of\nprocessed cheese.  Label terms that indi-\ncate you are using a processed cheese\ninclude pasteurized process cheese, cheese\nfood, and cheese spread.\nPreparation Tips\nTo get the most flavor from your cheese, it\nshould be allowed to warm to room tem-\nperature.  Therefore, take cheese out of the\nrefrigerator an hour in advance of when\nyou plan to serve it.  Keep the wrapper\nintact so the cheese does not dry out.\nThe opposite is true if you plan to grate\ncheese. It grates better when it is cold, and\n10 minutes in the freezer speeds the process.\nWhen melting cheese, use a gradual,\nmedium heat, because it can turn rubbery\nwhen heated at a high temperature.\nServing Suggestions\nBecause most cheese is high in fat — about\n40 percent of which is saturated — it\nshould accompany other foods rather than\nbe the centerpiece of a meal.  Also, most\ncheeses are high in sodium because of the\nsalt used for curing and flavoring.\nThat said, the flavor and texture of cheese\nmean that large quantities are not needed to\nenjoy it.  Cheese is excellent as a garnish for\nsoups and salads.  Or, crumble bits of real\nblue cheese on your salad instead of pour-\ning on fat-filled blue cheese dressing.  The\nMigraines, also called vascular\nheadaches, are thought to involve\nblood vessels in the brain, although \nthe exact cause is unknown.  Some\ncheeses contain a naturally occurring\ncompound called tyramine, which, in\nsusceptible people, can cause an\nincrease in blood pressure, an increase\nin the size of blood vessels in the brain,\nand headache pain.  For people who\ntake drugs called monoamine oxidase\ninhibitors (MAOIs), avoidance of all\nfoods containing tyramine — includ-\ning aged cheeses — is essential.\nTyramine is found naturally in\nfood. It is formed from the breakdown\nof protein as foods age.  Few studies\nhave measured tyramine content in\ncheese.  However, the research that has\nbeen done indicates that the longer a\ncheese has aged, the greater its tyra-\nmine content.  Compared with other\nfoods, aged cheeses have the highest\ntyramine content.  The amount of\ntyramine in cheeses differs greatly\nbecause of the variations in processing,\nfermenting, aging, degradation, or \neven bacterial contamination.  The\nfollowing types of cheeses are aged \nor have been reported to be high in\ntyramine and should be avoided if you\nare susceptible to migraines or if you\ntake MAOIs:\n• Blue cheeses \n• Brie \n• Cheddar \n• English Stilton \n• Feta\n• Gorgonzola \n• Mozzarella \n• Muenster \n• Parmesan \n• Swiss\nMIGRAINES AND CHEESE\nresult is a more authentic blue cheese taste\nwith less fat and fewer calories.  Top pasta\nwith a small serving of grated cheese, such\nas Romano or Parmesan, but lean heavily\non a vegetable-based sauce.  Use a single slice\nof cheese atop a veggie-filled sandwich, or\ntrade the cheese for a lean slice of turkey.\nWhen making nachos, sprinkle baked\ntortilla pieces lightly with sharp cheddar\ncheese and then top the chips with plenty\nof healthier options:  vegetables, beans, and\nsalsa.  If you have a craving for pizza, make\nyour own.  Take-out pizzas, especially if\nordered with extra cheese, can supply the\nentire day’s fat supply with one piece.\nYogurt\nYogurt is the result of milk that has been fer-\nmented and coagulated.  Its inception, prob-\nably by accident, was thought to be around\n4,000 years ago when nomadic Balkan tribes\nstumbled on the process as a way of pre-\nserving milk.  In this age-old process, milk\nis left at 110 degrees Fahrenheit for several\nhours to be invaded by friendly bacteria.  \n358\nPart II     Encyclopedia of Foods\n“living yogurt cultures” on the label.\nOther types of yogurt are pasteurized again\nafter the cultures have sufficiently\nfermented the yogurt.  This type is labeled\n“heat-treated.”\nActive yogurt cultures help to digest\ncasein, a protein found in milk.  There is\nalso some evidence that active yogurt\ncultures replenish the “friendly” bacteria in\nour intestines after the supply dwindles.\nThis decrease in bacteria happens because\nof normal aging, illness, or use of some\nmedications.\nYogurt did not attract Americans’ atten-\ntion until the health-food movement of the\n1960s.  Even now, Europeans still consume\n5 times as much yogurt as North Americans.\nConsumption in America is growing with\nthe increased marketing of yogurt that has\nadditional flavors added.  One caution:\nadded flavors can add calories and fat. \nPreparation Tips\nPlain yogurt can be used in place of cream\nor mayonnaise in recipes, but the result will\nbe less creamy and more tart.  Cooking with\nToday’s yogurt, however, is created in\na much more sophisticated manner.  The\nprocess starts with the milk.  The type of\nmilk used defines the fat, calories, and, con-\nsequently, the richness of the yogurt.  For\nexample, nonfat yogurt comes from nonfat\nmilk, and low-fat yogurt is derived from\nlow-fat milk.\nThe milk is then pasteurized.  One of\nthe two milk proteins — the whey — is\ncoagulated to create yogurt’s characteristic\nglutinous consistency, and the substance is\nthen homogenized and cooled.\nThe true yogurt-making process then\nbegins with the introduction of the starter\nbacteria cultures.  In North America, the\ntwo most common bacteria strains used are\nStreptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus\nbulgaricus. These two types of friendly bac-\nteria change the milk’s sugar (called lactose)\ninto lactic acid.  The lactic acid is respon-\nsible for the tangy, acidic taste of yogurt.\nThe more bacterial strains used, the stronger\nthe acidic flavor.\nSome of the bacterial cultures survive\nthe yogurt-making process.  This type of\nyogurt will list “active yogurt cultures” or\nTRANSLATING AT THE CHEESE\nCOUNTER\nCheese is a staple and a specialty in\nmany cultures, almost all of which\nimport cheese from one another.\nBelow is a guide for determining the\norigin of the milk used for various\ncheeses.\nAnimal\nFrench\nItalian\nSpanish\nCow\nVache\nVacca\nVaca\nSheep\nBrebis\nPecora\nOveja\nGoat\nChèvre\nCapra\nCabra\nyogurt can be a challenge because it curdles\nso easily.  Make sure to allow yogurt to\nwarm to room temperature before slowly\nheating it.\nLow-fat and nonfat versions of plain\nyogurt can be used in many recipes that call\nfor sour cream.  The acidity from the lactic\nacid creates a taste similar to that of sour\ncream, but the texture is a bit compromised.\nHowever, a half cup of sour cream has 214\ncalories and 21 grams of fat, and the same\namount of low-fat yogurt has 63 calories\nand 2 grams of fat.  From a health stand-\npoint, therefore, the texture becomes sec-\nondary.  Another option would to be to use\nhalf sour cream and half yogurt.\nBecause yogurt contains an acid that\ncan work as a tenderizer, it makes a won-\nderful marinade for meats.  Tandoori\nchicken, an Indian dish, is probably the\nmost well-known yogurt-marinaded meal.\nThe basic marinade consists of lemon juice\nand plain yogurt.\nYogurt can be used for fruit and veg-\netable dips, atop baked potatoes or cold\ncereals, or in stroganoff recipes.  It can even\nreplace the sour cream used with nachos or\nbe added to guacamole to reduce the fat. \nServing Suggestions\nYogurt is the ultimate convenience food.\nMost supermarkets stock single-serving\ncontainers tailor-made for lunch boxes or\nquick snacks.  Some producers have taken\nthis idea a step further, presenting yogurt\nin push-from-the-bottom tubes that can be\neaten without a spoon.\nHoney, fruit, and granola are popular\nadditions to yogurt, but yogurt can stand up\nto bolder additions such as chili.\nYogurt also offers two great dessert\nopportunities:  frozen yogurt and smoothies.\nFrozen yogurt can be found in the super-\nDairy Foods\n359\nHowever, it was not until 1926 that refrig-\neration allowed the mass production of ice\ncream.  With subsequent decades came bet-\nter freezers and an increase in ice cream con-\nsumption.  Today, the average American eats\nmore than 15 quarts of ice cream in a year.\nPart of ice cream’s popularity can be\nattributed to its smooth, creamy texture.\nThe process of homogenization helps create\nits unique taste by breaking down the size\nof the fat globules in the milk, making a\nsmoother product.\nAdding air also makes ice cream\nsmoother.  After flavors and colors have\nmarket freezer section or you can make your\nown by adding ingredients to yogurt and\nthen freezing it.  Smoothies can be made\nwith low-fat yogurt and fruit or fruit juice\nand then whipped in a blender as a healthier\nalternative to malts and shakes.\nIce Cream and Dairy\nDesserts\nEarly versions of the frozen confection we\nknow as ice cream probably used snow and\nsweeteners to please the palates in ancient\nChina and the Roman Empire.  The dessert\nmade its pilgrimage to North America in\n1774, when caterer Phillip Lenzi told a New\nYork newspaper that he would be selling a\ndessert he had discovered in London called\n“ice cream.”\nNONDAIRY DESSERTS\nMany items available in the “ice\ncream” section of your local super-\nmarket are not derived from dairy\nproducts.  Referred to as nondairy\nfrozen desserts, these ice cream sub-\nstitutes are derived from either soy-\nbeans or rice.\nSoymilk and tofu are the base \nof soybean-based products.  Water,\nfructose or other sweeteners, veg-\netable oil, and flavorings are added.\nRice-based desserts are treated with a\nspecial process that enhances the\nrice’s sweetness while breaking down\nthe proteins and starches.  This base\nalso needs sweeteners and additives.\nThese ice cream substitutes\ncontain no milk or lactose, so they\nprovide an alternative for persons\nwho have milk allergies or who are\nlactose-intolerant.  They also contain\nno cholesterol.  But some types,\nespecially the items made from tofu,\ncan have just as many calories as \nice cream.\nbeen added, but before any mix-ins such\nas fruit or candy pieces are added, the mix-\nture is whipped to increase its volume by\n150 percent.  Without this added air, the\ndensity of ice cream would resemble that\nof an ice cube.  Too much air, though,\ncreates an ice cream that is too mushy and\nunsatisfying in texture to serve.  Air does\nnot determine the difference between soft-\nserve and hard ice creams, however.  Soft-\nserve ice cream is not allowed to freeze fully,\nso it maintains its “soft” consistency and\ncan easily be manipulated by machine into\ncones or containers.  Hard ice cream is\nallowed to freeze so it can be scooped or\nspooned out of containers.\nIce cream can be made at home with\nan ice-cream maker, milk, cream, sugar,\nand flavors.  Many recipes also call for eggs.\n360\nPart II     Encyclopedia of Foods\npercent milk fat.  (Regular ice cream has\naround 10 percent milk fat, and premium\nvarieties can be as high as 16 percent.)  Most\nvarieties of ice milk also have fewer calories\noverall, but some brands add more sweet-\nener and flavoring to compensate for the\nless creamy texture.\nSherbet or sorbet — Sherbet’s main\ningredients are frozen, sweetened fruit juice\nand water, but it also can contain milk and\negg whites.  Therefore, sherbet is not a safe\nalternative to ice cream for persons with\nmilk or egg allergies.  Sorbets and ices may\nbe better choices, because they are supposed\nto be prepared without these ingredients.\nTheir names are not regulated, so always\ncheck the label before purchasing.  Both con-\ntain a liquid base (usually fruit juice), sweet-\nener, and water, but sorbets are less creamy\nHomemade ice cream does not contain the\nstabilizers used in commercial ice cream to\nincrease body and stave off melting.  Nor\ndoes it contain artificial flavorings, as many\ncommercial products do.  The result is a\ntexture and taste that are very different from\nthose of commercial ice cream. \nMost commercial ice cream has around\n10 percent milk fat and added sweeteners\nand so a high calorie count.  The count\nincreases with the number of high-calorie\nmix-ins:  pieces of fruits, nuts, candy, and\ncookies with flavored syrups in ribbons,\nswirls, and ripples.  Many of these ingre-\ndients have added fat.\nTypes of frozen dairy desserts include:\nIce milk — Ice milk has fewer calories\nfrom fat because it is prepared in the same\nmanner as ice cream but with only 3 to 5\nthan sherbets, and ices are even less creamy\nthan sorbets, usually with a granular texture. \nFrozen yogurt — Frozen yogurt is made\nfrom fermented milk treated with a lactic\nacid culture (see Yogurt, page 358).  It is\nsold in either soft-serve or hard forms.  It\nusually contains less fat than ice cream.  It\nalso provides the vitamins and minerals\ncommonly found in dairy products, unlike\nnondairy items.  However, frozen yogurt\ndoes not contain the same friendly bacteria\nDairy Foods\n361\nthat some forms of unfrozen yogurt do.\nThe freezing process kills the bacteria that\naid in digestion.\nPreparation Tips\nIt is fun to make ice cream at home, and\nseveral new makers on the market need little,\nif any, manual cranking.  Just gather the\ningredients, mix, and follow the manufac-\nturer’s directions.  Because homemade ice\ncream does not contain the stabilizers and\npreservatives of its commercial counter-\nparts, it lasts only a few days in the freezer\nbefore it starts to form ice crystals and pick\nup the ambient smells.  Therefore, it is best\nto make ice cream when the amount made\nwill be quickly consumed.\nFor the occasional snacker, commercially\navailable desserts provide no real preparation\ntime: allow the container to soften slightly\nFAVORITE FLAVOR\nWhat is the most popular ice cream\nflavor in North America?  Vanilla, \nof course.  It is the flavor of almost\n30 percent of all ice cream produced.\nNext on the list are chocolate and\nNeapolitan. \non the counter (perhaps only a minute or\ntwo), and then scoop out a 1.5-cup serving.\nServing Suggestions\nIce cream is delicious, but it should be an\noccasional indulgence, given the amount\nof calories and fat in it.  When it is time to\nsplurge, limit the amount of ice cream or\nother dessert treat to a small serving instead\nof filling a bowl.  In addition, choose a\nfrozen dessert that has less than 3 grams of\nfat per half cup, and use it as a foundation\nto enhance other, healthier foods.  For\nexample, add fruit — such as strawberries\nor bananas — to ice cream in equal ratios\ninstead of pouring on the chocolate syrup. \nTo lower your fat intake, choose sorbets\nand fruit ices or low-fat ice cream and ice\ncream substitutes.  Watch your serving size,\nhowever, so calories do not become a concern.\n363\nHerbs & Spices\nBasics\nAlthough many people think herbs and\nspices are one and the same, they are not. \nThe definition of herbs has varied\nthroughout the ages.  Generally, herbs are\nnow considered to be the aromatic leaves\nof plants that grow in a variety of climates.\nThe leaves are used fresh, dried, chopped,\nor crushed to add a subtle taste to foods or\noils.  Sometimes they are steeped in water\nfor teas and other beverages.  Herbs are usu-\nally added at the end of the cooking process\nbecause long cooking times can erode their\nflavor.\nSpices have many of the same uses as\nherbs.  They are usually grown in tropical\nareas.  Often, they have a more intense fla-\nvor and are derived from a wider range of\nplant parts: the fruit, seed, roots, flower\nbud, or bark.  Spices are usually added at\nthe beginning of the cooking process.\nBoth herbs and spices can be crushed\nfor nonculinary uses:  for medicinal pur-\nposes (see Chapter 2, sidebar:  Herbal\nProducts, page 37) or for use as fragrances\nin perfumes or lotions.\nNutrition\nHerbs generally contain less fat and carbo-\nhydrates than spices.  Both do contain some\nnutrients.  For example, basil and cloves\ncontain calcium and potassium.  The small\namounts of herbs and spices used in cook-\ning, however, minimize the nutritional con-\ntributions they might make in this way.\nHerbs and spices add only a negligible\nnumber of calories to the foods to which\nthey are added.  As a result, they are an\nexcellent replacement for both fat and salt\nwhen it comes to flavoring food.  Creative\nuse of herbs and spices can make it far easier\nto enjoy your meals while maintaining a\nhealthful diet. \nSelection\nFresh herbs and spices deliver the most\npleasing flavor.  For that reason, many serious\ncooks buy spices whole (such as the whole\nseed or stem) and grow their own.  In addi-\ntion, many cooks have their own herb\ngardens to have fresh herbs on hand.  Herbs\nare both easy to grow and attractive.  They\nare almost always perennial plants, so they\ncome back year after year.\nFortunately, for those without a green\nthumb, fresh herbs and spices are increas-\ningly available at the supermarket.  When\nH\nerbs and spices have been added to foods throughout history for preservation and\nflavor.  Although they are plentiful and inexpensive today, herbs, spices, and\nother flavorings were considered as valuable as gold or jewels for many centuries.\nQuests for them helped shape human history, influencing explorers to set out for the\nNew World in the 15th century and also leading to the establishment of trade routes\nbetween Europe, Asia, and Africa.\nIf you think about it, it is easy to understand why people long ago placed such an\nemphasis on flavorings for their food.  Easy refrigeration of food has been only a recent\ndevelopment.  Before its development, food perished rapidly and thus had a bad taste when\neaten.  Some food was preserved with large quantities of salt.  In addition, the wide variety \nof foods—particularly fresh fruits and vegetables—that we enjoy today was not available.  As \na result, the daily diet of people throughout much of history was bland and unexciting.  It is \nno wonder that herbs and spices were valued.\nToday, modern technology, agriculture, and transportation systems make our diets full \nof abundance and variety.  Herbs and spices, although no longer worth their weight in gold, \nnevertheless still play a crucial role in shaping cuisine and adding interest to foods.  They may \nalso play a role in health, offering an opportunity to add flavor without adding the health \ndrawbacks of excess fat or salt.\n364\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nand change the water every few days.  Fresh\nherbs stored in this manner will keep for\nabout a week. \nCommon Herbs\nBasil\nBasil is a member of the mint family.  Most\ntypes have shiny, light-green leaves and a\npungent, slightly sweet aroma.  There are\nmany types of basil, each slightly different\nin aroma and taste.  One of the most widely\nused herbs for seasoning tomatoes and\ntomato sauces, basil plays a key role in\nMediterranean, Asian, and Middle Eastern\ncuisine.  Basil particularly complements the\nflavor of garlic and olives.  It is also pleasing\ncombined with lemon.\nBay Leaf\nThe green, pointed leaves, usually sold dried,\nare grown on a small tree belonging to the\nthe product probably has lost most of its\nflavor and should be replaced.  Make sure to\ndate each container when you put it in your\npantry.  A rule of thumb is to keep dried\nherbs no longer than 6 months.  It is ideal\nto refrigerate dried herbs after 3 months.\nFresh herbs are highly perishable and\nmay last only a few days in the refrigerator.\nMaximize their shelf life by managing their\nmoisture.  They need some to avoid wilting.\nHowever, too much can cause them to rot.\nA solution is to pack fresh herbs in a per-\nforated plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper,\nwhich will help keep the air around the\nproduct humid.  Pat excess moisture off the\nleaves with a paper towel before putting the\nbag in the crisper. \nThis storage method works for most\nherbs, but there is a better one for basil,\ncilantro, sage, mint, parsley, and other leafy\nherbs.  They are best stored like a flower\nbouquet.  Tie the leaves together, stems\ndown, and put them in a container filled\nwith cold water.  Store in the refrigerator\nbuying them, look for products that appear\nthe freshest — those whose appearance and\naroma indicate that the time since they were\nharvested has been minimal.  Avoid products\nthat have mold on them or are discolored.\nDried herbs and spices are also widely\navailable.  A general rule is that 1/4 teaspoon\nground leaves or 1 teaspoon dried leaves\nshould be used for each tablespoon of fresh\nproduct. \nStorage\nBoth herbs and spices can lose their poten-\ncy over time, which is why proper storage\nis critical.  How this is done depends on\nthe type of product purchased. \nWhole spice seeds keep longer than\nground spices.  Both should be kept in tight-\nly closed containers in a cool, dry place.\nDried herbs should be stored in the same\nway.  Exposure to light and heat can cause\nleaves to deteriorate.  A rule for determin-\ning whether the product is still good is to\ntest its aroma.  If there is not much aroma,\nBoth herbs and spices have been used throughout history as\nmedicines.  In fact, some of the earliest medical manuscripts\nhighlight the theoretical healing properties of these plants.  \nThe best known of these ancient compilations are Inquiry Into\nPlants and Growth of Plants, written around 320 B.C. by\nTheophrastus, a Greek philosopher who studied with Aristotle.\nAnother herbal medicine tome, De Materia Medica, written\naround 60 A.D., includes descriptions of more than 600 herbs.\nIt is said to have influenced medicine for more than 1,500 years. \nWith the growing interest in alternative medicine, many\nphysicians and scientists have begun studying the therapeutic\npotential of these plants.  In some cases, they have found that\nsome plants or extracts made from them have promise in\nfighting disease or maintaining health.  However, some of the\nmost promising plants — such as saw palmetto for prostate\nenlargement — typically are not found in kitchens.  Nor is it\nlikely that the small amounts of herbs and spices used in cooking\ndeliver any medical benefits.\nMore study is needed to establish the role of these plants in\nhealth.  Until research is complete, it is best to avoid relying on\nthem for medical purposes or, at the very least, you should see a\nqualified medical practitioner before you use them.  Using them\nin place of traditional medicines may have harmful effects.  Side\neffects can result from improperly using just about any so-called\nnatural product.  Or, these products may interact dangerously\nwith a medication you are already taking.\nOne other caution is that regulation of the manufacturing\nand marketing of herbal supplements in the United States is far\nless strict than that of prescription medications.  There are no\nguarantees that the herbal supplement contains the amount \nof active ingredient the label claims.  In fact, testing of these\nproducts has found wide variation among supplement brands. \nMEDICINAL USES OF HERBS AND SPICES\nlaurel family.  They add a pungent, almost\nevergreen, flavor to foods, and the whole\nleaf must be removed before the food is\nserved.  Bay leaves are used to season a vari-\nety of foods.  Their use is especially called\nfor in simmered dishes, soups, stews, sauces,\nand tomato dishes.  Bay leaves can easily over-\nwhelm a food, so use them with caution.  The\nlonger they cook, the more flavor they add.\nChervil\nA member of the parsley family, chervil has\ndark-green curling leaves.  Its delicate flavor\nis similar to that of parsley, with a hint of\nanise and lemon.  Considered essential in\nFrench cooking, it is excellent in salads,\nsoups, and vinaigrettes and with seafood.\nChervil can be used to replace parsley.  It\nshould be used fresh, when its flavor is best.\nA caution:  chervil can lose flavor when it\nis overcooked.\nChives\nA member of the onion family, chives have\nlong, slender, hollow green stems and are\nusually sold in bundles.  The mellow, delicate\nonion flavor of chives is useful for sauces,\nsoups, baked potatoes, salads, omelets, pasta,\nseafood, and meat.  They are also commonly\nused as a garnish.  In addition, their light-\npurple flowers are edible.  Use fresh chives\nwhen possible because dried chives have little\nflavor.  Chives can lose flavor when cooked\ntoo long.\nCilantro\nCilantro is also related to the parsley family.\nIts lacy green leaves have a pungent, juniper-\nlike spicy flavor.  A popular seasoning used\nworldwide, cilantro particularly comple-\nments spicy foods.  It is commonly used in\nMediterranean, Latin American, and\nMiddle Eastern cuisines.  Cilantro is often\nfound in salsa.  It can overpower a dish.\nHerbs & Spices\n365\nbrown seeds.  Both are used for seasoning.\nThe leaves have a pungent, tangy taste, and\nthe seeds have a bitter flavor with caraway\novertones.  Dried leaves are sold as dill weed.\nDill complements the flavor of fish, chick-\nen, eggs, salads, and a variety of vegetables.\nIt is also used as a pickle flavoring.  Use\nfresh dill leaves whenever possible; drying\nUse it judiciously, adding a little at first.\nCilantro may be referred to as “fresh corian-\nder” because its seeds are ground into the\nspice coriander. \nDill \nAnother member of the parsley family, dill\nhas feathery leaves and flat, oval-shaped\ncauses them to lose their flavor.  The leaves\nalso make a lacy garnish.  Dill weed should\nbe used at the end of cooking so it will keep\nits flavor.  Alternatively, heat intensifies the\nflavor of dill seed.\nFennel\nFennel has long, green, feathery leaves on cel-\nery-like stems.  Both stem and leaves have a\ndelicate, anise-like flavor and may be eaten as\na vegetable.  Flowers produce seeds that may\nalso be used as a flavoring.  Raw fennel stems\nalso can add a subtle and different flavor\nto custard and ice cream.\nLemon Balm\nA member of the mint family, lemon balm\nimparts a strong lemony flavor to foods.\nUse it in fruit or vegetable salads, to gar-\nnish fish, or to freshen drinks.  Lemon balm\ncan stand in for lemon peel in most recipes.\nIn ancient times it was used to “balm”\n(comfort) wounds and to flavor alcoholic\nbeverages such as claret and mead.  It even\n366\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nand leaves may be added to salads.  Fennel\nalso can be used to flavor cheese, sauces, may-\nonnaise, and bread.  Fennel is a traditional\nseasoning for fish.  Use fresh fennel whenev-\ner possible to maximize flavor.  Overcooking\ncan cause fennel to lose its flavor.\nLavender\nSpikes of pungently aromatic purple flowers\nand gray-green leaves make identification of\nthis herb easy.  It is a traditional flavoring\nfor teas, candies, and desserts.

Only the lower 4 to 6\ninches of the stalk is used.  Lemon grass is\ncommon in Thai and southeast Asian cook-\nHerbs & Spices\n367\nused in many tomato-based dishes, but it\nhas a flavor that complements just about\nany food.  It is used widely in Mediterranean\ncooking and makes an excellent flavoring\nfor oil and vinegar.  This herb can be used\ninterchangeably with oregano.  Buy it fresh\nwhen possible.\nMint\nMint’s cool, aromatic menthol taste and\nsmell are instantly recognizable.  There are\nhundreds of varieties of mints:  peppermint\ning.  It enhances the flavor of curries, stews,\nsoups, chicken, and seafood.  Make sure to\nremove the lemon grass before serving.\nFresh lemon peel and grated ginger can be\nused in place of lemon grass.\nMarjoram\nMarjoram is made from the short, pale-\ngreen leaves of a shrub cultivated through-\nout Europe for centuries.

Excellent for fla-\nvoring oils and vinegar, sage goes well with\nthyme and oregano.\nSorrel\nThe slender, arrow-shaped leaves of sorrel\nimpart a sharp or acidic flavor to creamed\nsoups, meats, omelets, vegetables, or breads.\nIts flavor is due to oxalic acid, which should\nbe avoided by people with a history of\noxalate kidney stones.  Young tender leaves\nare mildest in flavor and may be cooked\nand served as a vegetable.\nTarragon\nNative to Siberia, this herb has narrow and\npointed, highly aromatic dark-green leaves.\nIt has a delicate anise flavor with under-\ntones of sage.  A staple in French sauces,\ntarragon is also widely used in chicken, fish,\nand vegetable dishes.  It may be used as a\nflavoring for wine vinegar.  There are two\ntypes of tarragon:  French and Russian.  The\nFrench variety has a delicate flavor, where-\nas the Russian tarragon has a stronger,\nslightly bitter taste.\nThyme\nThere are several varieties of this herb, which\nhas small, gray-green leaves and tiny purple\nflowers.  Garden thyme is the most widely\nused for cooking.  It has a strong, some-\nwhat bitter flavor.  Thyme is often used in\nherb butters, stuffing, soups, and dishes\nwith potatoes or beans as the main ingre-\ndient.  It is excellent in pasta sauces and is\nconsidered an important culinary herb in\nEurope, particularly in France.  Lemon\nthyme is best suited for fish and egg dishes.\nLemon thyme also can be used to make\nherbal tea. \nhas a more intense, peppery flavor.  A pop-\nular garnish, parsley also can be added to\nsoups, marinades, and salads.  Both types\nare often used to bring out the flavor of\nother herbs.  The flat-leaf variety is typi-\ncally used for cooking because of its more\nintense flavor.  The flavor of both types is\nstronger in the stalks.\nRosemary\nRosemary has needle-shaped evergreen\nleaves and a piney, lemon flavor.  Rosemary\nis used to season a variety of dishes, par-\nticularly in Mediterranean cuisine.  It may\nbe sprinkled on another of this region’s spe-\ncialties:  focaccia bread.  Rosemary branch-\nes can be burned under grilled meat or fish\nfor a more subtle flavor.  Use rosemary judi-\nciously.  It can be overpowering.\nSage\nThe soft, somewhat furry gray-green leaves\nof this herb have a pungent and camphor-\nlike taste and aroma.  A strongly flavored\nand spearmint are the most popular.  Often\nused as a dessert or candy flavoring, mint\nalso adds an interesting flavor to sauces, meat\ndishes, salads, and iced tea.  Lamb is tradi-\ntionally served with mint jelly.  Herbs that\nmix well with mint include cilantro, basil,\nand marjoram.\nOregano\nClosely related to marjoram, oregano has\na woody stalk with small green leaves.\nConsidered less sweet than marjoram, it is\nthought to have a stronger, more peppery\nflavor.  A ubiquitous pizza sauce flavoring,\noregano is also widely used in Mediterranean\ncuisine (mainly Italian and Greek) and in\nmeat and poultry dishes.  Oregano retains\nits flavor when dried.\nParsley\nParsley has long, slender stalks and feathery\nleaves.  It has a tangy, fresh, sometimes\nlemony flavor.  There are two main types:\ncurly leaf and flat leaf.  The flat-leaf type\nHerb focaccia bread\nCommon Spices\nAllspice\nAlso known as Jamaican pepper, allspice is\nground from the hard brown berries of the\nallspice tree, which grows in Mexico and\nthroughout the Caribbean.  Allspice is so\nnamed because it imparts the flavor of\nnutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.  An excel-\nlent addition to marinades, allspice is also\nused to flavor cured and jerked meat,\ndesserts, and sauces.  It is also an ingredient\nin gingerbread.  The finest allspice trees are\nthought to be grown in Jamaica.  Use the\nspice sparingly to avoid overpowering other\ningredients. \nAnise Seeds\nThe tiny gray-green anise seeds come from\na plant belonging to the parsley family.\nThey have a licorice flavor (anise is used to\nmake licorice), but one that also imparts a\nfeeling of warmth when the seeds are eaten.\nUsed to flavor breads, candies, and alco-\nholic drinks, anise seeds also can be added\nto cabbage or braised beef.  Anise seed is a\ncommon ingredient in Indian vegetable\nand fish curries.  Anise complements the\nflavor of cinnamon and nutmeg in baked\ngoods.  Anise leaves can be used to make\nherbal tea or added to salads.\nCaraway Seeds\nThese small, crescent-shaped brown seeds\nhave a nutty, peppery flavor.  Caraway is\noften used whole in rye bread or sprinkled\nover the top of baked goods, particularly\nin Germany and many northern European\ncountries.  It can also be added to potato\nsalad or meat loaf or sprinkled over pasta.\nGround caraway seed can have a very strong\nflavor.  Use sparingly.  Caraway also is used\nto flavor aquavit, a Scandinavian liquor.\nHerbs & Spices\n369\nCayenne (Crushed Red Pepper)\nMade from ground dried hot chili peppers,\ncayenne adds warmth to whatever foods it\nis added.  Capsaicin found in the chili’s\nseeds and membranes gives this pepper its\nfire.  It is popular in Mexican, Caribbean,\nChinese, and Indian cuisines.  It is also\nwidely used in barbecue sauces.  Cayenne\nis the main ingredient in chili powder.  Go\neasy on the use of cayenne if you are not\naccustomed to hot foods.\nCelery Seed \nCelery seeds are the small brown seeds of\nthe celery plant.  They give a strong celery\nflavoring to foods.  The seeds may be some-\nwhat bitter in taste.  Added to casseroles,\nfish, poultry, and sauces, celery seed is also\ngood in potato dishes and stuffing.  Celery\nsalt is called for in many recipes.  Instead,\nyou can use a small amount of plain celery\nseed along with some lemon zest. \nCardamom\nCardamom is made from the seedpods of a\nperennial plant that is part of the ginger\nfamily.  The seeds have a warm, sweet,\nslightly peppery flavor and an aroma that\ncombines ginger, coriander, and nutmeg.\nA popular ingredient in Asian cuisine,\ncardamom also is used in Scandinavian\ncooking as a flavoring for fruit compotes,\ngingerbread, and meatballs.  It goes well\nwith sweet potatoes and squash.  Green car-\ndamom pods are the most flavorful and\nneed to be ground before use.  Pods may\nbe bleached or lightened, however, and this\nprocessing may affect the flavor.  The light-\nened pods are preferred over the ground\nseeds, which lose their flavor quickly.\nGround cardamom can be mixed with\nother spices and therefore have a blunted\nflavor.  Cardamom can be expensive.\nHowever, a little goes a long way.  Less cost-\nly versions may have less flavor.\nTandoori chicken\nChili Powder \nA blend of dried chili peppers, chili powder\nvaries in intensity, flavor, and color.  It is\ntypically rusty red.  The powder also may\ncontain cumin, garlic, oregano, or salt.  This\nspice is used to flavor Southwestern cui-\nsine.  It is a common ingredient in chili\nwith beans and in chili con carne.  It adds\nheat to dishes with a dash of flavor.  Because\nchili powder ranges in flavor, many people\nlike to grind their own powder from the\nchili pepper they prefer.  Add the powder\n370\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nis excellent with sweet vegetables.  Ground\ncinnamon has more flavor than cinnamon\nsticks.  Its flavor deteriorates more quickly,\nhowever.  Depending on the type, cinna-\nmon may range from strong and spicy to\nsweet and mellow.\nCloves\nCloves are the oily unopened buds of the\nclove tree.  They have a pungent flavor and\naroma.  Cloves add flavoring to roasted\nmeat and can be used in pies and baked\nsparingly while cooking until the flavor and\nheat you desire are achieved.  The best chili\npowders are ground from only chili peppers.\nCinnamon \nCinnamon is ground from the curled bark\nof the evergreen cinnamon and cassia trees\nthroughout Asia, India, and Sri Lanka.\nCinnamon is sold ground or in sticks.

Used in many\ncultures, cumin is a seasoning for chick-\npeas, the background flavor for chili, or\nadded to couscous, vegetable dishes, or\nHerbs & Spices\n371\nyogurt.  Cumin is often mistaken for car-\naway.  If you grind your own cumin, toast\ncumin seeds in a dry skillet first to inten-\nsify its flavor.\nCurry\nCurry powder is a mixture of spices that\nmay contain coriander, cumin, pepper, chili\npeppers, ginger, fenugreek, onion, cinna-\nmon, paprika, saffron, cilantro, or turmer-\nic.  Ingredients may depend on the area of\nthe world in which the curry was mixed.\nCurry is a staple of Indian and southeast\nAsian cuisine.  It is used to flavor many\nmeat-based dishes and soups.  Curry pow-\nder adds a sweet, distinctive, and sometimes\nhot flavor to foods.  A common use is in\nstews.  Curry also complements the flavor\nof lamb.  Because the flavor of curry may\nvary, many cooks prefer to grind their own.\nBeware of store-bought curry powders,\nwhich may contain mostly turmeric.  This\ngives dishes a yellow color, and the flavor\nmay be bitter.\nstar anise\nallspice\nvanilla\njuniper\nturmeric root\nmace\nnutmeg\ncardamom\nfenugreek\ncumin\n372\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nFenugreek Seeds\nGround from the seeds of a plant belonging\nto the pea family, fenugreek has a bitter-\nsweet flavor but leaves a caramel or maple-\nlike aftertaste.  A component in many\nIndian dishes, fenugreek also can be added\nto curry powders.  Or, it may be used to\nflavor artificial maple syrups.  Use sparingly;\nthe flavor of fenugreek can be overpowering.\nGinger (Gingerroot)\nIn fresh form, the knobby gingerroot’s peel\nis discarded and its flavorful flesh is sliced,\nchopped, or minced and added to dishes\nfor its peppery, sweet, and pungent flavor.\nThe dried form is ground from the ginger\nroot.  This brownish gold spice has a warm,\nslightly sweet, slightly citrus  flavor.  Fresh\nJuniper berries give gin its flavor.  Berries\nshould be crushed before they are used.\nLicorice Root\nFrom this woody plant licorice flavor is\nextracted and used in candy and medica-\ntions.  The extract also may be used to color\nand thicken stout or porter beers.  The\nsweet taste of natural licorice extract comes\nfrom glycyrrhizia, a naturally occurring\nchemical that, if ingested in large quantities,\nhas adverse effects on blood pressure.  For\nthis reason, in the United States, most\nlicorice candy is flavored with anise or is\nartificially flavored (check labels).\nMace and Nutmeg\nBoth come from the same tree.  Nutmeg is\nground from the seed.  Mace is from the\nseed’s covering.  Both have a sweet, warm\nflavor.  Mace is somewhat more pungent.\nFavorites in baked goods and fruit dishes,\nmace and nutmeg can also enhance the\nflavor of stewed beef or poultry or can be\nadded to baked vegetables.  Nutmeg is a\nkey spice in a holiday classic, eggnog.  Both\nare excellent toppings for the foamed milk\non espresso coffee drinks.\nMustard\nMustard seeds can be used in pickling foods.\nGround seeds can be added to sauces or to\nadd zip to salad dressings.  The condiment\ncan be eaten on meat and fish and added to\nsalad dressings or mayonnaise.  Keep prepared\nmustard in the refrigerator to preserve its\nflavor.  For a different flavor, look for mustard\nvarieties made with wine or vinegar.\nPaprika\nBright russet-orange in color, paprika is\nmade from ground sweet red peppers.\nDepending on the variety, paprika may\nadd either a mild, sweet flavor or hot\nginger is popular in Asian and Indian cui-\nsine.  Ground ginger also is used in many\nbaked goods and desserts.  Ginger is the\nbasis for ginger beer and ginger ale.  Pickled\nginger root is an Asian delicacy and is often\nserved with sushi.  \nGingerroot is sold at many supermar-\nkets, and it is easy to add fresh, grated gin-\nger to dishes.  Although fresh ginger can\nbe substituted for the dried form, do not\nsubstitute dried in place of fresh because\nthe flavors are quite different.\nJuniper Berry\nThe hard purple berries of an evergreen\nbush, juniper berries have a turpentine-like\nflavor.  Juniper berries add a spicy, pungent\nflavor to game, red cabbage, or meat stews.\nHerbs & Spices\n373\nwarmth to food.  Widely used in Hungarian\nand Spanish dishes, paprika adds flavor\nand color to potatoes, soups, baked fish,\nand salad dressings.  Hungarian paprika is\nconsidered the finest and can be purchased\nin specialty shops.  A note of caution:  it\nmay be hotter in flavor than other types of\npaprika.\nPepper\nPepper is one of the world’s most common\nspices and one of its most versatile.  Used in\nnearly every culture, pepper is a condiment\nGreen pepper — Typically sold\ncanned, green peppercorns are green pep-\nper berries that are harvested before they\nmature.  They are mild in flavor.\nBlack pepper — These peppercorns\nare pepper berries harvested just as they are\nabout ready to turn red.  Black pepper is\nthe most flavorful of all pepper varieties.\nIt is often sold ground, although many con-\nnoisseurs prefer to grind their own with a\npepper mill. \nWhite pepper—This milder pepper is\nmade from peppercorns that have turned\nfound on tables worldwide.  Ground or\nwhole, it can add a kick to nearly any dish,\nadding warmth and texture with just the\nright amount of subtlety.  It is a popular\naddition to soups, stews, cheeses, marinades,\nand luncheon meats.\nPepper is actually the fruit of the pep-\nper plant, which is a vine indigenous to\nIndia.  Small white flowers on the plant\nproduce peppercorns.  They turn various\ncolors — green, red, then brown — as they\nmature and can be harvested and used at\nany time during their ripening stage.\nVinegar is used in almost every culture as a condiment.  It can\nbe made from a wide range of foodstuffs — from grains, fruits,\nwine, or even ethyl alcohol.  Essentially, the process to turn any\nof these into vinegar is the same.  Bacteria is added to an alcohol\nsolution to convert the alcohol in acetic acid.  The liquid is\nthen processed and pasteurized to kill any organisms in it that\nmight be harmful to humans.  It also may be distilled before it\nis bottled for consumer use.\nVinegar's tart, acidic flavor makes it a versatile ingredient.\nIt is often used to make vinaigrette dressings, mustards, or\nmarinades, as a condiment for seafood, or to flavor dishes in\nwhich beans are the primary ingredient.  In addition, it can \nbe used to pickle and preserve foods.\nHow vinegar is used depends on what type it is:\nBalsamic vinegar — Considered the finest of all vinegars,\nbalsamic vinegar is added to salads, pasta, and cooked vegetables.\nIt has a dark color and rich flavor with herbal and wine under-\ntones.  Balsamic vinegar is traditionally made in northern Italy\nin the provinces of Modena and Reggio.  Look for the word\n“tradizionale” on the label.  This indicates that the vinegar has\nbeen aged at least 12 years.  Balsamic vinegar from Modena that\nuses the term “vecchio” on the label means the vinegar has been\naged 12 years or more.  “Extra vecchio” is vinegar that is 25\nyears old or more.  The vinegars from Reggio are color-coded\naccording to quality: red label (highest), silver, and gold.  These\n“real” balsamic vinegars are expensive.  Commercial balsamic\nvinegars are not regulated and are quite different.  Some chefs\nenhance the flavor of the vinegar by adding brown sugar or by\nboiling it to intensify its flavor.\nCider vinegar — As the name suggests, this vinegar is\nderived from fruit juices — usually apple.  It retains an apple\nflavor and is often used for pickling.\nMalt vinegar — This type of vinegar is made from malted\nbarley.  Malt vinegar is typically colorless.  However, brown\ncoloring is often added.  It has a strong, sour flavor and is\nfrequently used as a condiment for fish and chips.\nRice vinegar — Made from sake, a Japanese rice wine, rice\nvinegar is used in many sweet-and-sour recipes for Asian cuisine.\nWine vinegar — This type of vinegar can be made from\nvarious red or white wines.  It is thought to have the most\n“bite” of any vinegar.  Wine vinegar is most often used as an\ningredient in cooking, particularly soups and stews.\nFlavored vinegars are popular in gourmet shops.  But it is\neasy to make your own.  Choose your herbs, preferably fresh\nones, blanch them, and pat dry.  Transfer the herbs to a food\nprocessor and then add 1/2 to 2/3 cup of vinegar, one with a\nless intense flavor.  Process until you have achieved the desired\nconsistency.  Transfer the mixture back into the bottle of vinegar.\nLet the mixture sit overnight, and then strain the vinegar before\nputting it back into the original container.  A sprig of your\nchosen herb can be added to the bottle for decoration.  Although\nvinegar is acidic and is pasteurized, introducing herbs does\ncontaminate it.  The risk for illness is not high.  Make flavored\nvinegar in small amounts, refrigerate it, and use it within a \nweek to maintain freshness.  Or, better yet, purchase one of\nmany commercial varieties, which have been heat-treated.\nVINEGAR\nred and therefore are ripe.  The dark outer\nshell of the berries is removed before the\npepper is processed.  White pepper is also\ntypically sold ground.\nOther types of pepper you may find are\ngray pepper and pink pepper.  Gray pepper\ncan be a mix of white and black pepper,\nalthough it can be a black pepper that has\nbeen minimally processed.  It typically has\na mild flavor.  Pink pepper is not made from\nthe berries of the pepper plant.  Instead, it\nis derived from a South American shrub\nthat is a member of the ragweed family.  Its\nflavor is more subtle than that of pepper. \nFor maximal flavor, buy peppercorns\nwhole and grind them yourself.  Ground\npepper may have undesirable additives.  An\nadvantage to buying whole peppercorns is\nthat they can be kept for months at room\ntemperature.  In contrast, ground pepper\nkeeps its kick for 3 months or less. \nSaffron\nOne of the most expensive spices, this golden\nred spice is made from the powdery stigma\n374\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nthan table salt and may contain other chem-\nicals — such as magnesium and calcium\n— found naturally in sea water.\nKosher salt — This coarse-grained salt\nis often sprinkled over baked goods or sal-\nads.  It contains no additives, and many say\nit tastes less salty than table salt (although\nit has the same amount of sodium as table\nsalt).  It is made and processed in compli-\nance with guidelines set forth by the Jewish\nreligion.\nRock salt — This salt is mined from\nnatural deposits in the earth’s surface.  Table\nsalt is typically refined from rock salt. \nSeasoned salt — Spices, herbs, or other\nagents may be mixed with salt to make a\nseasoned, salty product.  Most of these\nproducts are made up primarily of salt. \nSalt plays a key role in many different\nfunctions of the human body.  However, too\nmuch of it can be harmful to your health. \nEating salt in moderation can be difficult.\nMany foods contain some salt naturally.\nPrepared foods often contain high amounts\nof sodium, in some cases a thousand\nof a purple-flowered crocus.  Saffron is used\nfor soups, seafood, poultry, and rice dishes.\nIt is a popular seasoning in Indian, Italian,\nand Spanish cuisine.  It also can be added\nto baked goods.  Saffron needs to be dis-\nsolved in a teaspoon or so of warm water\nbefore use.  Powdered saffron may have\nother ingredients added to it, and these\nreduce its flavor.\nSalt\nSalt is made of crystallized sodium and chlo-\nride and has been used for centuries to add\nflavor to food and to preserve it.  Today,\nthis condiment can be found on virtually\nevery table in Western nations.\nVarious salts are available today:\nTable salt — Often supplemented with\niodine, table salt consists of fine-grained\nsalt crystals that may be treated to help it\nflow freely out of salt shakers. \nSea salt — Available in both fine and\ncoarse grains, sea salt is made by evaporat-\ning sea water.  It can be used at the table or\nfor cooking.  It has a bit more of a tang\nQUICK TIP\nGrinding your own spices is easy, and\nthe taste makes the effort well worth\nit.  After buying fresh whole seeds,\nsimply put them into a coffee grinder\nor pepper mill.  You can intensify the\nflavor by first lightly toasting the seeds\nin a skillet.  Another advantage of\ngrinding your own spices is that whole\nseeds keep longer than ground spices.\nIn addition, you can be sure that no\nunwanted preservatives or other ingre-\ndients have been added.  Be sure to\nclean the coffee grinder or pepper mill\nafter use.  Otherwise, residues may be\nleft that will affect the taste of other\nspices ground in it. \nmilligrams of sodium or more.  Foods high\nin salt include condiments, pickled foods,\ncanned vegetables, convenience foods, and\ncured meats.  Always look at the label to\nensure you know how much salt you are\ngetting.\nOne simple but important step to cut\nback on salt is to taste your food first before\nadding salt to it.  Too often, salting is a\nreflex, not a necessity.  A better strategy for\nreducing salt in your diet is to cut back\ngradually and reduce or eliminate prepared\nfoods altogether. \nSesame Seeds \nThe tiny flat seeds of a plant native to India,\nsesame seeds have a nutty, slightly sweet\ntaste.  Sesame seeds are used as a topping\nfor bread and crackers.

Turmeric can be\nsubstituted for saffron. \nVanilla\nA spice usually sold in liquid form, vanilla\nis extracted from the dried seed pods  (beans)\nof a tropical plant belonging to the orchid\nfamily.  It has a sweet, rich scent and flavor.\nAdded to cookies, cakes, and other baked\ngoods, vanilla is a widely used flavoring for\nice cream, desserts, and coffees.  Check the\nlabel to make sure you are getting real vanil-\nla extract.  Real vanilla extract, which has\nfar more flavor than synthetic vanilla fla-\nvorings, is also much more expensive.\n“Vanilla” brought back from tropical areas\nmay contain coumarin, a harmful substance\nthat can cause kidney and liver damage. \npeas to make hummus.  Toast seeds before\nusing them to enhance their flavor.\nSzechuan Peppercorns\nDespite the name, these dried berries are\nnot related to traditional black peppercorns.\nThey come from a type of ash tree and have\na peppery, somewhat citrus taste.  Popular\nin Chinese cuisine, Szechuan peppercorns\noften are mixed with salt or used as a fla-\nvoring for cooking oils.  This flavored oil\nalso can be used as a salad dressing.\nAlthough growing in popularity, Szechuan\npeppercorns may be available only at stores\nspecializing in Asian foods.\nTurmeric\nDeep yellow in color, this spice is made\nfrom a root related to ginger.  It has a sharp,\nwoodsy taste.  Widely used in Indian cuisine,\n377\nBeverages\nBasics\nIn the world of science, water is referred to\nas the universal solvent.  This label is clear\nin practical terms in any kitchen or restau-\nrant.  Served by itself or as part of some-\nthing else, water is a basic ingredient in all\nbeverages. \nThroughout history, water has been\nheated, chilled, brewed, carbonated, had\nherbs and other flavorings steeped in it, or\nbeen added to other ingredients and fer-\nmented.  The result is a rich array of bev-\nerages to choose from: \nCoffee—Brewed from the roasted beans\nof the semitropical coffee plant, coffee is\nenjoyed around the world, and each cul-\nture offers a different variation on this basic\nbeverage.\nTea—Another beverage that crosses cul-\ntural lines, tea is water that is heated with\ndried leaves from the evergreen shrub\nCamellia sinensis.  A variation is herbal tea,\nin which herbs such as chamomile are used. \nJuice—The liquid squeezed from fruits\nand vegetables has been enjoyed as a bev-\nerage throughout history. \nSoda pop—A beverage of the modern\nage, this highly sweetened carbonated drink\nis popular despite its nutritional drawbacks.\nIt’s high in sugar and calories and has no\nappreciable nutrients in it. \nWine—At its most basic, wine is sim-\nply fermented grape juice, which of course\nis made up mainly of water.  There are thou-\nsands of variations of this ancient alcoholic\ndrink.\nBeer—Another international beverage,\nbeer is water brewed with yeast, hops, and\nother ingredients to yield a carbonated, alco-\nholic drink with a distinctive taste and yeasty\nsmell that is enjoyed around the globe.\nOf course, water itself should not be\noverlooked as a beverage.  Served through-\nout history to quench thirst and comple-\nment meals, water is now available in a myr-\niad of forms, from bottled to carbonated to\nstraight from the tap.  The numerous vari-\neties of water sold commercially make it easy\nto enjoy this clear, colorless, calorie-free, and\nmost ancient of all beverages. \nNutrition\nThe calories and nutritional content of bev-\nerages depend on what has been added to\nB\neverages are used to quench thirst in everyday settings.  At meals, they make \na flavorful complement for foods.  Special occasions are marked by toasts of \na favorite beverage.  Drinking coffee, tea, soda pop, juice, or water is often used to\ndesignate breaks during an ordinary workday.  Beverages are as diverse as the cultural\nlandscape worldwide.\nLike the food choices we make, the choosing of beverages plays a crucial role in\nour health.  Drinking enough water, for example, is critical for many different body\nprocesses and thus is vital for good health.  In contrast, beverages high in calories, \nfat, or sugar can contribute to obesity, tooth decay, and other health problems.\nThose high in caffeine, a chemical stimulant, can have other health drawbacks \nif consumed in excess.  Beverages high in alcohol can affect our judgment and \ncoordination and may even be addictive. \nPerhaps at no other point in time has there ever been such a wide variety \nof beverages available. To help you make the most healthful choice, the \nfollowing sections contain information about many of the most\nwidely used beverages (information about milk is contained in\nDairy Foods, page 345).\n378\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nintroduced in the late 1700s and is con-\nsidered the forerunner of soda pop.\nSoda water—A carbonated water that\ncontains sodium bicarbonate.\nClub soda—The same as soda water\nexcept that mineral salts have been added.\nTonic water—Tonic water has been\ncarbonated and flavored with fruit extracts,\nsugar, or quinine.\nMost water sold commercially comes\nin handy storage containers—usually cans\nor tightly sealed bottles.  Water in these\ncontainers can be kept indefinitely, chilled\nor in the pantry.  Be sure not to let con-\ntainers freeze, particularly carbonated types\nof water.  Unlike other substances, water’s\nvolume expands when it freezes.  The result-\ning ice will break the container. \nWater\nConcerns about the safety of tap water have\nresulted in a burgeoning market for bottled\nwater, making it one of the most widely\nsold commercial beverages.  Within the cat-\negory of bottled water, there is a vast array\nof water types from which to choose.  The\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA), which regulates bottled water,\nclassifies them in this way: \nArtesian water—This type of water is\ndrawn from a confined aquifer (a rock  for-\nmation containing water that stands above\nthe natural water table).\nDistilled water—This is water that has\nbeen evaporated and then condensed, leav-\ning it free of dissolved minerals.\nPurified water—Purified water has\nbeen demineralized.  It is produced by\ndeionization (passing it through resins) or\nby reverse osmosis (passing it through\nfilters to remove dissolved minerals).\nDistilled water is also considered purified\nwater.\nMineral water—Water that contains\nno less than 250 parts per million (ppm)\nof totally dissolved, naturally occurring\nsolids or minerals.  Mineral water can be\nlabeled “low mineral content” (less than\n500 ppm) or “high mineral content” (more\nthan 1,500 ppm).\nSpring water—Spring water is\nobtained from an underground formation\nfrom which water flows naturally to the\nsurface.  It also can be collected through a\nbore drilled into the spring.\nSparkling water—Another name for\ncarbonated water, sparkling water contains\ncarbon dioxide gas that is in it naturally or\nhas been added to it.\nSeltzer water—A type of sparkling\nwater. The name comes from the town of\nNieder Selters in Germany. Seltzer was\nthe water that is their basic ingredient or\nthe process that the water has been through.\nFor example, drinks high in sugar are also\nhigh in calories.  Alcoholic drinks are also\nhigh in calories.\nThe most important nutritional infor-\nmation to remember about beverages, how-\never, is how vital water is to your health\nand that most people do not drink enough\nwater.  The recommended daily amount is\neight 8-ounce glasses of water.\nTo understand why water is so impor-\ntant, consider that your body is one-half\nto four-fifths water.  Every system in your\nbody depends on water.  Water regulates\nyour body temperature, removes wastes,\ncarries nutrients and oxygen to your cells,\ncushions your joints, helps prevent consti-\npation, aids kidney function, and helps dis-\nsolve vitamins, minerals, and other nutri-\nents to make them accessible to your body.\nLack of water can lead to dehydration.\nEven slight dehydration can sap your\nenergy, contribute to headaches, and make\nyou feel lethargic.  Dehydration poses a\nparticular health risk for the very young\nand very old. \nYou lose about 10 cups of fluid a day\nthrough sweating, exhaling, urinating, and\nbowel movements.  Exercising or engaging\nin any activity that causes you to perspire\nincreases your daily water requirement, as\ndoes hot, humid, or cold weather and high\naltitudes.  Some beverages, such as those\nwith caffeine and alcohol, are dehydrating,\nso if you drink them, you need even more\nwater to compensate.\nStorage and Selection\nStorage and selection of beverages depend\non what it is you plan to drink.  The follow-\ning sections provide this information and\nmore for some of the most common and\nwidely used beverages.\nPreparation Tips\nMost tap water in the United States is safe\nto drink.  Try serving tap water with ice and\na slice of lemon or lime, which gives the\nwater a pleasing taste.  Prices for bottled\nwater range a great deal.  Generally, howev-\ner, less expensive types of bottled water com-\npare favorably with more expensive versions.  \nServing Suggestions\nWater is an excellent beverage for any occa-\nsion.  Try serving sparkling water for special\noccasions, putting it in a champagne flute\nor wine goblet for added visual appeal.  For\neveryday occasions, make water the default\nbeverage you choose.  Soda pop and other\nbeverages should be chosen far less frequently.\nDrink a glass of water when you get up, one\nwith each meal, and another when you go\nto bed.  Keep a bottle with you during the\nday or take regular water breaks. \nBeverages\n379\nused commercially are one of two main\nspecies: Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta.\nMost of the beans used around the world\nare arabica beans, which are grown at a high\naltitude, require plenty of rainfall, and are\nconsidered somewhat difficult to cultivate.\nRobusta beans flourish at lower altitudes\nwith less intense care.\nArabica beans, however, are thought to\nproduce the finest flavor.  They are also the\nmost expensive coffee beans.  For this rea-\nson, supermarket coffees contain mostly\nrobusta beans, although some arabica beans\nmay be mixed in for a richer flavor.  Despite\nthe less intense flavor of robusta beans, they\nhave about twice the caffeine content of\narabica beans (see sidebar:  Decaffeinating\nCoffee Beans, page 380).\nCoffee beans can be roasted, ground,\nmixed, brewed, and flavored in various ways.\nCoffee\nCoffee beans are actually the seeds of a cherry-\nlike fruit of the semitropical coffee plant,\nwhich is grown in Brazil, Colombia,\nIndonesia, and parts of Africa and Central\nAmerica.  The seeds are separated from the\ncoffee fruit and then roasted.  During roast-\ning they acquire the rich, dark-brown color\n(a result of caramelization, melting, and\nsubsequent browning of sugars in the beans)\nmost people associate with coffee beans.\nRoasting time affects both the flavor and\nthe color of coffee beans.  Generally, the\ndarker the beans, the longer they have been\nroasted.  Longer roasted beans also typi-\ncally have the most intense flavor. \nThere are dozens of varieties of coffees,\nmany of them named after their country\nor port of origin.  However, all coffee beans\nSAFETY OF TAP WATER\nMany Americans are concerned about\nthe safety of their tap water, which \nhas led to a dramatic increase in sales\nof water filtration systems and bottled\nwater.\nMost tap water, however, is fine.\nIt is regulated by the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) for safety\nand purity and chlorinated to destroy\nmost organisms that can spread\ndisease.  However, small amounts \nof microbiological and chemical \ncontaminants are allowed within \nEPA limits of safety or when water\ntreatment equipment breaks down.\nThe EPA requires public suppliers\nto notify consumers if water from\npublic supplies does not meet safety\nstandards.\nCommon coffee drinks:  café latte, perked coffee, espresso\nThe result?  Numerous specialty coffee drinks\nfor coffee connoisseurs to choose from:\nEspresso—This dark, strong, and con-\ncentrated coffee is made by forcing hot\nwater through coffee that is very finely\nground, darkly roasted, and specially blend-\ned.  It is so rich that when served unadorned,\nonly a small quantity is needed.  Thus,\nespresso usually is served in a tiny cup, often\nreferred to as a demitasse.  Espresso also\nmay be the foundation of other specialty\ncoffee drinks.\nA welcome consequence is that excellent\ncoffee can be made at home.  The outcome\nof home brewing, although somewhat\ndependent on the equipment you own, is\naffected mainly by the type of coffee you\nbuy.  Perhaps the best thing you can do to\nensure a good cup of coffee is to buy fresh,\nwhole beans, grinding them just before\nbrewing.  Follow grinding instructions on\nyour grinder carefully, paying particular\nattention to recommended grind times.\nAvoid beans or preground coffee packed\nin the large, traditional round canisters.\nThis packing method almost always allows\nsome oxygen into the container, which can\ncause the coffee to become stale.  Instead,\nlook for coffee sold in vacuum-packed bags,\nwhich have a mechanism that allows gas in\nthe container to escape but does not let any in.\n380\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nCafé au lait—From the French for\n“coffee with milk,” café au lait is made with\nequal parts of regular coffee and scalded\nmilk.  In France and Quebec, café au lait\nis considered a morning tradition. \nCafé latte—Very similar to café au lait,\nthis coffee beverage is equal parts of foamy\nsteamed milk and espresso.\nCafé mocha—More dessert than bev-\nerage, café mocha is made with espresso,\nchocolate syrup, and foamy, steamed milk.\nThe chocolate syrup adds considerable calo-\nries to this coffee drink.\nCappuccino—This is espresso topped\nwith the creamy foam from steamed milk.\nSome of this milk may be added to the\nespresso.  Sometimes sweetened cinnamon,\ncocoa, or vanilla powder is sprinkled over\nthe foamed milk.\nTurkish coffee—An intensely flavored\ncoffee beverage, Turkish coffee is made by\nbringing finely ground coffee to a boil\nseveral times.  Sugar, water, and spices such\nas cinnamon or cardamom can be added.\nThe flavor of Turkish coffee is so rich that\nonly a small quantity is served. \nThe growing interest in specialty coffees\nhas spurred an interest in the types of coffee\nbeans used at home for the regular brew.\nOnce, only gourmands bought whole beans\nand ground them at home.  Now, coffee\ngrinders are considered routine kitchen\naccessories.  Specialty coffee makers are also\nbecoming more commonplace. \nDECAFFEINATING COFFEE BEANS\nVirtually all coffee beans naturally\ncontain caffeine, a chemical stimulant\nthat can increase heart rate and blood\npressure and act as a diuretic and may\nhave some addictive properties. \nThere are several ways to remove\nthe caffeine from coffee beans.  One\nmethod uses a solvent to remove\ncaffeine chemically.  The beans are\nwashed afterward to remove the\nsolvent.  Roasting also removes any\ntraces.  A second method is the Swiss\nwater process, in which steam is used\nto heat the beans.  Then, the outer\nlayer of the beans, which contains\nmost of the caffeine, is scraped off.\nThe Sanka brand of coffee, introduced\nin the early part of the 20th century,\nwas the first caffeine-free coffee devel-\noped in the United States.  Its name\ncomes from the French term “sans\ncaféine,” which means without caffeine. \nWHAT IS INSTANT COFFEE?\nInstant coffee (almost always made\nfrom robusta beans) is simply freshly\nbrewed liquid coffee that has been\ndehydrated into a powder.  Adding\nwater to this powder rehydrates the\ncoffee, thus resulting in a quick, if\nperhaps less flavorful, cup of coffee.\nPowder particles are processed to look\nmore like traditional coffee grounds.\nSome instant coffee brands are\nfreeze-dried.  This means that the\ncoffee solution was frozen to extract\nthe water from it.  The resulting\nproduct looks more like traditional\ncoffee grounds and has a richer flavor. \nFrench press \ncoffee maker\nFrench press coffee:  mix fresh ground\ncoffee and hot water; steep for 3 to 4\nminutes.  The lid has a screen that\npushes the grounds to the bottom.\nAt home, store coffee at room temper-\nature and try to use it as soon as possible.  If\nyou use coffee from a can and it will be\nopen for more than 2 weeks, place it in an\nairtight container in the refrigerator.  If the\ncan will be open for more than 1 month,\nplace the coffee in an airtight container in\nthe freezer.  Return the coffee to the refrig-\nerator or freezer immediately after mea-\nsuring the amount you will use.\nPreparation Tips\nIn addition to using fresh beans and grind-\ning them just before brewing, other ways\nto improve the flavor of home-brewed\ncoffee are the following:\nStart off with clean equipment—Oil\nresidues from previous batches of coffee\ncan cling to equipment and affect flavor—\nparticularly if flavored coffee was used. \nUse fresh, cold water—Using hot\nwater will result in flatter-tasting coffee.\nAlso, make sure the water is free of miner-\nals or other chemicals.  If you don’t like the\ntaste of your tap water, consider using fil-\ntered or bottled water. \nUse the right amount of coffee—For\ntraditional coffee-brewing machines,\n1 tablespoon of coffee grounds is recom-\nmended for each 6 ounces of water.  Adjust\nthe amount of coffee grounds to your\npreference.\nDon’t steep coffee grounds in the\ncoffee too long—This extracts bitter sub-\nstances from the grounds that affect the\ntaste of the coffee.\nConsider the filter—Paper filters may\naffect the texture of the coffee.  Consider\nusing a metal filter in your coffee maker\ninstead.  Metal filters are available for most\ntypes of machines. \nAvoid flavored coffees—Many of these\ncoffees are made with lower-quality beans.\nBeverages\n381\nTea\nTea is said to be the universal beverage.\nMade from the leaves of an evergreen plant\n(related to the camellia flower) steeped in\nhot water, this beverage is a part of daily\nlife from Great Britain to Morocco to\nChina, where tea is thought to have origi-\nnated.  Most of the leaves grown for the\nworld’s tea are still grown in Asia, although\nsome is produced in the United States.  \nAll types of teas are made from the\nleaves of the same plant, Camellia sinensis.\nTypically, finer teas use only the top leaf\nand bud; stronger, coarser brews use the\nleaves farther down on a branch.  Tea leaves\nare typically dried after they are picked and\nthen are broken into fragments, which bring\nforth the oils that give tea its flavor.  Climate,\nsoil, and processing give tea different tastes\nand characteristics. \nInstead of buying them, grind your own\nbeans and add coffee flavorings of your\nown.  Most coffee shops sell essences and\nflavorings just for this purpose.\nServing Suggestions\nCoffee complements various foods and can\nbe served by itself or mixed with other fla-\nvorings throughout the day.  Coffees with\ncream or milk are typically considered\nmorning coffees, and espresso is considered\na beverage for later in the day.  If you are a\nfrequent coffee drinker, keep in mind that\ncoffee is high in caffeine (up to 105 mil-\nligrams per 6-ounce cup).  In addition,\nspecialty coffees can be high in calories or\nfat if made with cream or whole milk or\nflavorings such as chocolate.  Use skim milk\ninstead of whole milk in coffee drinks\nwhenever possible.\nTea field\n382\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nbeen blended with spices and flavorings to\nenhance tea flavor and aroma.  Thousands\nof blended teas are available worldwide.\nPopular blended teas include English break-\nfast and Earl Grey.\nHerbal teas—Not made from tea leaves,\nherbal tea is a tea-like drink made by steep-\ning herbs, flowers, and spices in heated\nwater.  Herbal tea has been made through-\nout history, often for medicinal purposes or\nsimply to make water taste better.  Popular\nherbal teas are made from chamomile, rose\nhips, and mint, to name just a few.  In\nFrance, herbal teas are referred to as “tisanes.”\nHerbal teas typically contain no caffeine. \nInstant tea—Popular in the United\nStates since the 1950s, instant tea is tea that\nhas been dehydrated and granulated so that\nit dissolves rapidly in water.  Often, it also\ncontains sugar and other flavorings. \nStore tea away from heat in a sealed con-\ntainer.  Tea keeps for about 6 months.  After\nthat, it loses its flavor and should be discarded.\nPreparation Tips\nThe best tea is made using whole or large\nfragments of tea leaves, available in many\nspecialty tea shops.  Many of these shops also\nsell implements, such as mesh containers,\nwhich allow tea leaves to infuse their flavor\ninto water without leaving the leaves behind. \nTo make a good cup or pot of tea, start\nby using cold, fresh, and filtered water (if\nOolong teas—Oolong tea has charac-\nteristics of both black and green teas.  Its\nleaves are fermented for about half the time\nof black tea.  Oolong tea originated in the\nFukien province of China, where much of\nthe world’s production of oolong tea takes\nplace.  Formosan tea, named for the for-\nmer name of Taiwan, is considered by many\nto be the finest oolong tea.\nBlended teas—Often referred to as\nEnglish teas, these are black teas that have\nThe main types of tea include: \nGreen tea—A favorite in Asia, green\ntea is so named because the leaves are dried\nand fragmented soon after picking.  Tea\nmade from these leaves is mild and fresher\nin taste than other types of tea.  Because of\nthis, green tea usually is not served with\nmilk or sugar.  Types of green tea include\ngunpowder, Tencha, and Gyokuro, a\nJapanese tea also known as pearl dew tea. \nBlack tea—Actually a dark reddish\nbrown tea when it is brewed, the strongly\nflavored black tea is popular in Western\nnations.  It is the most processed and\nstrongest flavored tea.  After the leaves are\npicked, they are allowed to ferment in the\nopen sun before being dried.  The size of the\ntea leaves determines the grading of black\ntea.  Common black tea varieties include\nCeylon, Assam, and Darjeeling, considered\nby many to be the finest black tea. \nCOMPARING CAFFEINE CONTENT\nBrewed beverage\nCaffeine content \n(6-ounce cup)\n(in milligrams)\nGreen tea\n25\nBlack tea\n35\nCoffee\n105\nFAST FACT\nAlthough the English are known for\ntheir love of tea, ingenious Americans\ninvented the tea bag and began the\npractice of drinking iced tea in the\nearly 1900s. \nyou don’t like the taste of your tap water).\nHeat the water to a simmer—do not boil—\nremove from heat, and add the tea.

Green teas\nusually need to be steeped in water for 1 to\n2 minutes, and black teas may require 3 to\n4 minutes.  Avoid oversteeping.  More than\n5 minutes can make all types of tea bitter. \nServing Suggestions\nTea is an excellent beverage at any time of\nthe day.  Black teas are typically served at\nbreakfast, often with milk and sweeteners.\nHerbal teas typically do not contain the\nstimulant caffeine and thus are excellent\nchoices in the evening.

It also\nusually indicates that sweeteners were added.\nPreparation Tips\nNumerous juicing machines are available\non the market, many of them relatively\ninexpensive.  Try making your own juice\nat home with one of these machines.  Not\nonly do you guarantee that you are getting\na pure product but also you can experiment\nwith different combinations of fruits.\nOrange and pineapple, for example, make\na tasty, tangy fruit juice.

To reduce the amount of caffeine\nyou consume, try substituting juice for\ncoffee at coffee breaks.

In addition, afternoon tea, an old\nbut widespread tradition, often includes\nbaked sweets such as scones or cookies.\nKeep your tea break healthful by limiting\nthese sweets.  Serve fruit or slices of whole-\ngrain bread instead.\nJuice\nCompared with the numerous beverages\navailable today, juice remains a nutritious\nchoice.  It retains most of the nutrients (vit-\namins, minerals, and phytochemicals) in\nthe original fruit or vegetable, although it\nmay also be higher in calories and sugar\nthan many suspect.  There are 175 calories\nin 12 ounces of apple juice, for example,\nand 230 calories in grape juice.  Apple juice\nhas 45 grams of fructose, a naturally occur-\nring form of sugar, and grape juice has 57\ngrams of this sugar.  Tomato juice contains\n62 calories in a 12-ounce serving; however,\nit also contains 1,314 milligrams of sodium.\nIf you are monitoring your sodium intake,\nalways check labels of vegetable-based juices. \nIn addition, be aware that not all juices\nsold today are all juice.  Some may be 100\npercent fruit juice, but other brands may\nhave juice mixed with water or simply be\nwater with added sugar and flavoring.  The\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration reg-\nulates the terms used on juice labels and\nrequires manufacturers to state the per-\ncentage of pure juice used in the product. \nTerms consumers may encounter\ninclude:\n100 percent juice—These juices do\nnot contain added water. \nFrom concentrate—This juice has\nundergone processing to remove most of\nthe water from the original fruit juice.  The\nTEAS AND POSSIBLE HEALTH\nBENEFITS\nTea has been consumed throughout\nhistory for its supposed curative\npowers, and medical research now\nsuggests that there are health benefits\nfrom drinking green and black teas.\nSeveral studies show an association\nbetween consumption of green tea\nand reduction in the risk for cancer\nand heart disease.  Green tea naturally\ncontains chemical compounds called\npolyphenols.  Within this family of\ncompounds are chemicals that appear\nto play a role in cell growth and pro-\ngrammed cell death, which could be\nimportant in preventing and control-\nling cancer.  Polyphenols also are\nantioxidants that can help prevent \ncell damage and may help prevent \nformation of plaque in the arteries.\nSoda Pop\nOnce soda pop was the exception rather\nthan the rule when it came to choosing a\nbeverage.  Now, it is virtually the default\nbeverage for adults and children alike.  In\nfact, some studies indicate that soda pop\nmay provide up to 20 percent of teens’\ncalories each day.  In addition, up to 20\npercent of toddlers drink soda pop.\nThis increased consumption is unfortu-\nnate because soda pop is devoid of nutrition.\nInstead, it is high in calories and, typically,\nsugar.  One can of regular, nondiet soda pop\nhas between 150 and 200 calories.  It also\nhas between 9 and 11 teaspoons of sugar\nand 30 to 70 milligrams of caffeine.  These\nvalues are only part of the issue, however. \nBy choosing soda pop, adults and\nchildren alike are missing out on the\nnutrients provided by beverages such as juice\nand milk.  In fact, many physicians and\nnutritionists are concerned that today’s teens\nmay be placing themselves at high risk of\nosteoporosis—a bone-thinning disease—as\n384\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nthey grow older because they are not get-\nting enough calcium during their adoles-\ncent and early adult years.  Phosphates in\nsoda pop may cause the body to eliminate\ncalcium during urination.  There are also\nconcerns about soda pop’s effect on tooth\ndecay because of its high sugar content and\nsome of the acidic chemicals within it.\nPreparation Tips and Serving\nSuggestions\nSoda pop has little if any role in a healthful\ndiet.  If you do decide to drink it, limit it\nas much as possible.  Selecting caffeine-free\nand diet soda pop can eliminate some of\nthe nutritional hazards of these beverages,\nbut not all of them.  When eating out,\nencourage children to order milk.  At home,\nmake sure there’s a selection of beverages\navailable—including chilled water—that\nwill help family members make more\nhealthful choices. \nWine\nWine is the naturally fermented juice of\ngrapes or other fruit, vegetables, or grains.\nIt has been a beverage used at meals and\ncelebrations for thousands of years.  Today,\nthere are vineyards and wineries throughout\nthe world.\nGeneral types of wine include the\nfollowing:\nRed wines—Typically dry and full-\nbodied, common red wines are made from\na variety of grapes, including cabernet sauvig-\nnon, merlot, pinot noir, syrah, and sangiovese.\nWhite wines—White wines range\nwidely in flavor, from dry and tart to sweet\nand fruity.  They also are made from various\ngrapes, including chardonnay, sauvignon\nblanc, chenin blanc, and riesling.\nRosé or blush wines—These wines\nalso vary in flavor from sweet to tart.  These\nwines are made with red-skinned grapes\nbut are processed in such a way that the\njuice’s contact with grape skins is limited.\nSparkling wine—Sparkling is simply\nanother way to say bubbly.  Perhaps the\nbest-known sparkling wine is champagne,\nalthough there are numerous other types.\nSPORTS DRINKS\nSo-called sports drinks offer another\nbeverage alternative, albeit one\nmarketed mainly at athletes.  The\ndrinks contain mostly sugar, water,\nsodium, potassium, and flavorings.\nWhether they provide any additional\nbenefit to athletes is debatable.  For\nhigh-performance athletes, there may\nbe some benefit from using these\ndrinks because they replace sugar and\nsodium lost during extended periods\nof exercise.  Water is still the preferred\nbeverage for the average person and\nathlete.  Plus, it has no calories or\nsugar, which most sports drinks do.  \nWINE STORAGE\nIt is not necessary to have a specially\nbuilt wine cellar to store wine.\nAnywhere with a temperature from\n45° to 65° Fahrenheit is acceptable, \nas long as the temperature does not\nfluctuate.  The warmer the tempera-\nture, the faster the wine will age.\nCork-sealed wines should be stored \non their sides to prevent the cork \nfrom drying.\nThe flavor of sparkling wines ranges from\nslightly sweet to dry.  They usually have a\nlighter flavor than traditional wines.\nFortified wines—Brandy or other\nliquors may be added to sherry, port, or\nother dessert wines to increase alcohol in\nthem.\nAromatic wines—So-named because\nthey are flavored with herbs or spices.\nVermouth is an example of a flavored wine. \nRice wine—Rice wine is a sweet, gold-\nen wine and usually has a low alcohol con-\ntent.  It is produced by fermenting steamed\nrice.  Sake and mirin are two well-known\nrice wines.  Rice wine is a frequent part of\nAsian cuisine.\nAccess to and varieties of wine have\nincreased as vineyards and the art of wine-\nmaking have spread throughout the world.\nWhereas only a few regions of the world\nwere thought to produce excellent wine\ndecades ago, consumers now have an array\nof wines—not to mention prices—from\nwhich to choose.  Wines from the tradi-\ntional winemaking areas of France remain\nexcellent, of course, but they now have\ncompetition from wines produced in\nGermany, Italy, Spain, the United States,\nand Australia.  Less traditional winemak-\ning areas such as South America and South\nAfrica also offer enjoyable wines. \nA wine myth that should be dispensed\nwith is that wines automatically improve\nwith age.  Wines do need about a year to\nBeverages\n385\nbe served at a temperature between 50° and\n55° Fahrenheit.  Use caution when chill-\ning white wine.  Refrigerating it for more\nthan 2 hours before serving can lower its\ntemperature too much and blunt its flavor\nand aroma.\nServing Suggestions\nAnother wine myth is that only certain\ntypes of wine are served with particular\nfoods.  This is true in that certain types of\nwine complement the flavors of certain\nfoods.  Red wine, for example, is excellent\nwith hearty or spicy meals or with a steak.\nWhite wines complement fish or poultry,\nand dry, tart wines are excellent with\ndesserts.  However, the vast majority of\ndinners are casual enough that it is not\nnecessary to observe these guidelines.\nage after their production.  But after that,\nit is recommended that most white wines be\ndrunk within 5 to 6 years.  Many red wines\nimprove with age.  However, the extent of\nimprovement depends largely on the quality\nof the wine.  For less expensive varieties,\nage is not always a good thing. \nWine does complement the flavor of a\nvariety of foods.  However, it also can be\nhigh in calories.  A 5-ounce glass of wine\nhas 100 to 226 calories.  Some studies show\nthat phytochemicals in wine may have some\nhealth benefits (see sidebar:  Alcohol and\nHealth, page 387).  However, moderation in\nwine consumption is still recommended.\nPreparation Tips\nMost red wines should be served at room\ntemperature.

In fact, his-\ntorians believe that brewing began shortly\nafter humans started to cultivate grains.\nOver the centuries, brewing has evolved\ninto a highly scientific process.\nBeer today generally contains about 5\npercent alcohol and is brewed from malted\nbarley and grains such as corn or rye and\nflavored with hops.  Yeast also is used for\nfermentation.  The quality of the water\nstrongly influences beer’s flavor and char-\nacter because 90 percent of beer’s volume\nis water. \nThe many varieties of beer include the\nfollowing:\n386\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nFruit beer—Fruit beers are mild beers\nwith concentrated fruit juice added.  A\npopular fruit beer in the United States is\nmade with cranberries.\nLager—This clear, golden brew is an\nAmerican favorite.  It is stored in casks until\nsediment and residues left from the brew-\ning process settle out.  The residue is then\nremoved.  \nMalt liquor—Despite the name, malt\nliquor is a beer, one that has a higher per-\ncentage of alcohol (up to 9 percent) than\nother types of beer.  In comparison, most\nbeers have an alcohol content, by weight,\nfrom 5 to 8 percent.  \nPilsner, or pilsener—This is a pale,\nlight lager beer that was originally brewed\nin Pilsen in the Czech Republic.  The term\nis now used to describe most pale, mild-\nflavored lager beer.\nPorter—The addition of roasted malt\ngives this beer its dark color and strong\nflavor.  Porters may have a higher alcohol\ncontent than regular beer.\nStout—Another favorite of the pubs in\nEngland and Ireland, stout has a strong,\nbittersweet flavor and a dark-brown color.\nRoasted barley helps give this beer its\ncharacter.  Guinness is a well-known form\nof stout.\nWheat beer—Sometimes known as\n“weitzen,” which is German for wheat beer,\nthis type of beer has a pale-gold color and\na mild flavor similar to that of a lager.  It is\nmade from malted wheat, which is why it\nis named wheat beer.\nLight beer—Largely an American\ncreation, light beer has fewer calories than\nregular beer and less alcohol.  Nonalcoholic\nforms of beer also are available.\nUnlike wine, beer is best soon after it\nis produced.  Beer connoisseurs believe that\nbeer older than 2 months should not be\nserved.

The temperature of the\nHeavy drinking always carries risks.  But increasingly, studies \nare showing that light drinking (defined as 1 drink or less a\nday for women and 2 drinks or less a day for men) may have\nsome health benefits.\nPerhaps the most significant benefit is in cardiovascular\nhealth.  Alcohol may help increase levels of high-density\nlipoprotein (“good”) cholesterol and may help reduce the\nclotting that can lead to a heart attack or stroke.  Red wine\nalso is thought to contain phytochemicals (compounds\noccurring in plants) that also may help protect against\ncardiovascular disease.\nOther studies suggest that light drinking may help protect\nagainst Alzheimer’s disease, senility, and macular degeneration,\nan eye condition that is the leading cause of blindness in\npeople age 65 years or older.\nThese benefits, however, are far from proved, and more\nstudy is needed to determine the role of light drinking in a\nhealthful lifestyle.  In addition, the potential benefits come\nwith some substantial risks.\nAny alcohol is hazardous for a pregnant woman and her\ndeveloping fetus.  In addition, it is risky for anyone with a\nfamily history of alcohol addiction to use alcohol. \nAlcohol use has health risks for everyone else.  Alcohol\nslows brain activity, which in turn affects alertness and coordi-\nnation, increasing the risk of falls and accidents while driving.\nIt also can affect sleep and sexual function, increase blood\npressure, and play a role in heartburn.  There is also the\nhazard of drug interaction, for both over-the-counter and\nprescription drugs.  In addition, heavy, chronic drinking has\nbeen linked with an increased risk of obesity, high blood\npressure, osteoporosis, and cancer of the throat, stomach,\ncolon, and breast.  Addiction is also a risk for anyone who\nuses alcohol.\nFor all of these reasons, moderation remains a key part \nof a healthful lifestyle.  If you don’t drink, there’s no health\nreason to start doing so.  If you already drink, there’s no\nreason to stop.

This chapter provides information on the various types\nof fats, oils, and sweeteners and the foods that contain them.\n389\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\nFats & Oils\nBasics\nFats, no matter what their source, play an\nimportant role in the food we eat.  For cen-\nturies, every culture has taken advantage of\nthe unique chemical properties of fats —\nfor example, fats easily absorb other flavors.\nFats also are used to cook foods, add a pleas-\ning texture, impart tenderness to baked\ngoods, and, in societies where food is scarce,\nincrease the calorie content of a food.  Fats,\ntherefore, are a basic ingredient in cooking. \nThe term “fats,” however, is broad,\nencompassing many different substances\n— from butter to lard to vegetable oil.  All\noils, for example, are fats.  But not all fats\nI\nf there is any food group that we have a love-hate relationship with, it’s fats, oils, and\nsweeteners.\nOn the one hand, these foods play a vital role in our enjoyment of what we eat.  Fats\nand oils give a creaminess, richness, crispiness, or pleasing mouth-feel to foods.  Sweeteners\nalso satisfy a universal and natural craving.  On the other hand, the pleasure that fats, oils, and\nsweeteners bring can come at a cost.  These foods generally are high in calories, making\nit difficult for someone who eats a lot of them to maintain a healthful weight.\nThey also have other health disadvantages.  Too much of the wrong kinds\nof fats and oils can increase the blood cholesterol level, which in turn\ncan increase risk for cardiovascular disease.  Sugar and highly sweet-\nened foods also are typically high in calories and provide few\nnutrients.  For that reason, “empty calories” is a term often used\nto describe sweeteners or foods rich in them.  Sugar and tooth\ndecay are linked when sugar is eaten in excess and dental \nhygiene is poor.\nThe Food Guide Pyramid recognizes both the advantages and\nthe disadvantages of these foods.  It does not eliminate them.  But it does place them at the very\ntip of the pyramid.  It’s okay to use these foods as long as they are eaten sparingly.  Making sure fats,\noils, and sweeteners play the proper role in your diet involves knowing more about them, their role in\nthe diet, and what foods are rich in them.  To help you do this, this chapter provides more detailed\ninformation on the types of fats, oils, and sweeteners you are likely to consume. \nare oils.  Although definitions vary, for\ncooking purposes fats are generally charac-\nterized as follows:\nFats — Generally defined as substances\nthat are solid at room temperature, fats\ninclude butter, cocoa butter, lard, margarine,\nsuet, and vegetable shortening. \nOils — Oils remain liquid at room tem-\nperature.  Oils can be made from various\nplants and seeds:  vegetables, olives, rapeseed\n(from which canola oil is made), sunflower\nseeds, corn, peanuts, soybeans, walnuts,\nalmonds, hazelnuts, safflower seeds, grape-\nseed, sesame seed, mustard seed, and coconuts\nare among the most commonly used.  \nNo matter what form they take, fats are\nmade up of fatty acids, which are the\nmolecular building blocks of fats in the\nsame way that amino acids combine to form\nprotein.  At their most basic, fatty acids are\nmolecular chains of hydrogen, carbon, and\noxygen atoms.  The differences in the\nchemical structure of fats make some better\nfor you than others (see Chapter 2, Sorting\nOut the Fats, page 26).  \nSometimes a process called hydrogena-\ntion is used to make liquid oils solid at room\ntemperature.  This also converts unsatu-\nrated fat into trans fat.  Trans fats are used\nin many processed and fast foods, such as\ndoughnuts, crackers, chips, and french fries.\nTrans fats also give margarine its butter-like\nconsistency.  Trans fats tend to increase your\ncholesterol level and therefore should be\n390\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nunrefined oils, you will likely appreciate\nthe difference between these oils and their\nmore highly processed counterparts.\nStorage\nThe method of storage depends on whether\na fat or oil is being stored.  However, both\nbecome rancid given enough exposure to\nair, sunlight, and heat. \nFats such as butter, margarine, and lard\nshould be tightly wrapped and refrigerated.\nThey usually can be stored this way for up\nto 2 weeks.  Extra butter or margarine can\nbe stored in the freezer for up to 2 years.\nHydrogenated vegetable shortening can be\nstored, tightly covered, at room tempera-\nture for as long as 3 months.  \nOils require a slightly different strategy.\nThey should be stored in airtight containers\nthat are opaque to prevent light from pen-\netrating.  Refrigeration is also generally\nrecommended  for oils.  Unopened oils can\nbe kept this way for up to a year, although\nthey should be used within a few months\nafter they are opened.\nCooler temperatures may cause oil to\nlook cloudy or congeal.  Removing the oil\nfrom the refrigerator and allowing it to reach\nroom temperature should resolve this prob-\nlem.  An important guideline for evaluating\nthe freshness of oil is to trust your nose.  If\nthe oil smells fishy or musty, discard it.\nThe following sections provide more\ninformation on specific fats and oils. \nthey add up to obesity, you are at increased\nrisk for health problems.\nSelection\nBe discriminating in the type of fat you con-\nsume.  Limit animal fat (saturated) and trans\nfats (hydrogenated oils).  Instead, use small,\nsensible amounts of plant-based (monoun-\nsaturated and polyunsaturated) fats.\nWhen purchasing products, always\ncheck the expiration dates.  Rancidity is a\nconcern with any type of fat. \nPurchasing oils, of which there are\ndozens of varieties, involves a close reading\nof the package label.  Most cooks prefer to\nbuy “cold pressed” oils, which means that\nminimal heat and pressure are used to\nextract the oil from the original plant or\nseed.  This type of processing is considered\nimportant because it allows oil to maintain\nmore of the plant’s natural flavors and tex-\ntures. With the exception of extra-virgin\nolive oil, however, it is difficult to find cold-\npressed oils.\nA good alternative is to use so-called\nunrefined oils.  Unrefined oils are extracted\nwith heat.  Unlike other oils, unrefined oils\nundergo minimal processing after this\npoint.  The result is a more flavorful oil\nand, sometimes, a more darkly colored oil.\nUnrefined oils generally include virgin olive\noil and corn, nut, soybean, canola, and\nsesame oils.  Unrefined oils break down eas-\nily under heat and thus should not be used\nfor deep-frying.  Because deep-fried foods\nare not typically part of a healthful diet,\nyou should not have to trade a flavorful oil\nfor one with more cooking versatility.\nMost oils in your supermarket, however,\nare not only extracted with heat but also\nundergo much more processing, including\nusing chemicals to de-gum, refine, bleach,\nand deodorize the oil.  The result?  Less flavor.\nAfter experimenting with cold-pressed or\neaten in only limited amounts (see Chapter\n3, Limit Trans Fat, page 66).\nNutrition\nFat is an essential nutrient.  Our bodies\nrequire small amounts of several fatty acids\nto build cell membranes and to support\nlife-sustaining functions (see Chapter 2,\nFat as a Nutrient, page 26).  That said, the\nold adage about “too much of a good thing”\nis appropriate in discussing fat.  Virtually all\nhealth experts agree that fat intake should\nbe limited.  The federal government, the\nAmerican Heart Association, and other\norganizations recommend that fat intake\nfor a healthy individual should be less than\n30 percent of total daily calories.  They also\nrecommend that less than 8 to 10 percent\nof total calories come from saturated fat.\nAlthough various kinds of fat have dif-\nferent effects on your blood cholesterol, all\nfoods that are high in fat are high in\ncalories.  High-fat foods can easily increase\nyour calories, making it difficult to main-\ntain a healthful weight.  Fat packs more\ncalorie punch than any other type of nutri-\nent group.  Per gram, fat has 9 calories\n(about 100 calories per tablespoon, or 250\ncalories per ounce).  In contrast, protein\nand carbohydrates have just 4 calories per\ngram.  Because of this, you do not need to\neat very much fat before reaching the 30\npercent threshold. \nIf a low-fat diet is good, is an even\nlower-fat diet better?  Not necessarily.\nUpper limits of fat intake have been estab-\nlished, but the same is not true for lower\nlimits.  Talk with your health care provider\nabout the recommended fat intake that is\nbest for you.  Even a low-fat diet can lead\nto weight gain if you cut back on fat but\ntake in excess calories by ignoring the rest\nof what you eat.  Too many calories from\nany source result in added pounds.  And if\nFAST FACT\nIf you are trying to reduce the fat in\nyour diet, you are not alone.  Food\nconsumption surveys report that\nabout two-thirds of American adults\neat low-fat or reduced-fat foods and\nbeverages.\nFats\nButter\nButter is made from the fat that comes from\nmilk from cows, sheep, goats, horses, and\nother mammals.  Most commercially pro-\nduced butter in the United States is made\nfrom cow’s milk. \nButter making occurs in several stages.\nCream that separates from milk is pasteur-\nized (heated at a high temperature) to kill\nany organisms that might be harmful to\nhuman health.  Then the cream is placed in\na ripening tank for 12 to 15 hours.  There,\nit goes through another series of heat treat-\nments that give butter a crystalline struc-\nture when it cools, helping it to solidify.\nThe next step is to churn the butter.\nThis process breaks down the fat globules\nin the cream.  The result is that the fat is\ncoagulated into butter grains.  The mixture\nis then separated, the remaining butter paste\nis worked until it is smooth, and, depend-\ning on the producer, it may be salted.\nFurther variations in processing influence\nits characteristics, including aroma, taste,\ncolor, appearance, and quality.  \nThere are numerous butter variations.\nThose you find in gourmet markets include\na French butter known as beurre (butter)\nde Charentes.  Beurre de Charentes has an\nivory color and tastes very rich.  Another\nEuropean-style butter growing in popular-\nity in the United States is ripened butter,\ntraditionally made in Denmark and the\nNetherlands, which is softer than regular\nbutter.  It also has a slightly tangy taste\nbecause lactic acid is added to the cream\nfrom which it is made.\nMore common variations include the\nfollowing: \nWhipped butter — Whipped butter’s\nname is self-explanatory.  It has air beaten\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n391\ntype in supermarkets, many serious cooks\nprefer to use unsalted butter in cooking and\nbaking.  Unsalted butter is thought to have\na sweeter flavor.  In addition, many cooks\nprefer to control the salt they add to a dish\nor baked food.\nBoth light butter and whipped butter\nwork well for toppings, but neither can be\nsubstituted for regular butter in recipes for\nbaked goods because of the air or water they\ncontain.\nServing Suggestions\nButter is one of the most versatile cooking\ningredients and the foundation of numerous\ngourmet foods, sauces in particular.  Its taste\ncan be enhanced by mixing it with herbs and\nspices and then refrigerating it again.  One\npopular flavored butter is garlic butter, which\ncan be made by creaming the desired amount\nof butter and mashed garlic cloves to taste.\nOregano, marjoram, basil, or parsley also can\nbe added.  Numerous recipes for flavored\nbutter are available in cookbooks.\nButter’s health drawbacks are well\nknown, however, and thus it should be used\nselectively.  If that special dish simply cannot\nbe made without butter, don’t try to sub-\ninto it.  The result is that it is slightly lower\nin fat and calories than regular butter.  It is\nvery soft and spreadable.\nLight butter — Light butter usually has\nabout half the calories of regular butter.  It\nalso generally has less fat and less salt\nbecause water is usually added to it. \nUnsalted butter — This is butter to\nwhich no salt has been added.\nClarified butter — An ingredient in\nsome recipes, clarified butter is butter that\nhas the milk solids removed from it.  The\nadvantage is that it has a higher smoke point\nthan regular butter, which increases its\ncooking versatility.  It also keeps longer than\nbutter and is thought to have a more pure\nflavor.  Clarified butter is similar to a type\nof butter called ghee that is used in India.\nButter should be refrigerated and stored\nin opaque packaging that prevents light from\nentering.  In addition, the packaging should\nseal in moisture to prevent the butter from\nbecoming dehydrated, a process that inten-\nsifies its color and detracts from its flavor. \nPreparation Tips\nShould you use salted butter or unsalted?\nAlthough salted butter is the most common\nWHAT IS AN OIL’S SMOKE POINT, AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\nAn oil’s smoke point is simply the point at which fat, when heated, starts to smoke,\nsmell acrid, and, as a result, give an unpleasant flavor to food. \nEach type of oil has a different smoke point.  It is dependent on the free fatty\nacids that make up the oil.  The higher the oil’s smoke point, the higher the tem-\nperature it can withstand.  Safflower and canola oils have the highest smoke point\nand are the most ideal for frying or sautéing (435° to 450° Fahrenheit).  Olive oil\nhas a lower smoke point and is best used in salad dressings (extra virgin, 250°\nFahrenheit) or in baking (regular olive oil, 410° Fahrenheit).\nBeyond the bad flavor imparted to foods, there are health reasons to avoid\nusing an oil that has reached its smoke point.  High temperatures can cause the oils\nto decompose, and this process, in turn, can irritate the lungs and cause gastroin-\ntestinal upset.\nHOW TO “CLARIFY” BUTTER\nTo make clarified butter, start by\ncutting unsalted butter into small\npieces.  Melt the butter over low\nheat for 10 to 15 minutes.  This\nallows the fat to separate from the\nmilk solids.  Then gently pour or\nspoon off the clarified butter fat and\ndiscard the solids.  After the fat\ncools, it may appear to have a grainy\ntexture.  Clarified butter keeps\nlonger than regular butter because\nthe milk solids have been removed.\nIt generally is used only for cooking\nbecause it has the advantage of\nhaving a higher smoke point than\nregular butter.  Thus, it can be\nheated to higher temperatures, \nwithout burning, making it a good\nchoice for frying or sautéing.\nhealthier choice than harder “stick” mar-\ngarines because the hydrogenation process\nused to make margarine hard adds trans\nfats to the product.  When buying mar-\ngarine, check the label and avoid products\nwhose labels include these terms:  “partially\nhydrogenated” or “hydrogenated.”  Instead,\nlook for margarines whose main ingredient\nterms include “liquid” oils.\nPreparation Tips\nGenerally, only regular margarine should\nbe used for cooking and baking.  Liquid,\nwhipped, or reduced-fat versions of this\nproduct burn easily or contain too much\nwater or air for these purposes.  Margarine\nshould be stored in the refrigerator and can\nbe frozen for several months.\nServing Suggestions\nHard or stick margarine is a good choice\nfor pastries, helping to make crusts light\nand flaky.  It can be used to replace butter\nin most recipes, although its flavor may not\nbe as rich as that of butter.  Like butter, this\ntype of margarine has health drawbacks —\nit is high in calories and trans fats that are\nlinked with heart disease — and should be\nused in moderation. \nLard\nLard is simply a name for pure animal fat\nthat has been processed, including filter-\ning, bleaching, hydrogenation, and emul-\nsification.  Lard used in cooking is typically\nrendered from pork fat.  Lard rendered from\nthe fat around the pig’s kidney is considered\nthe best lard to use.\nLard is used worldwide in cooking,\nalthough it fell out of favor in the United\nStates during the past several decades\nbecause of the amount of saturated fat\nin it. \n392\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nReduced-fat or nonfat margarine —\nThese products contain 25 to 65 percent less\nfat than regular margarine.  To reduce fat lev-\nels, modified margarines and spreads are cre-\nated with varying amounts of water and\nthickening agents, such as gelatin, rice starch,\nand guar gum.  Some margarines even make\nhealth claims (see Chapter 3, sidebar:\nCholesterol-Lowering Margarine? page 66).\nButter-margarine blends — Designed\nto add butter flavor, these products are\nusually 40 percent butter and 60 percent\nmargarine.\nSoft margarine — These margarines are\nusually made from only vegetable oil and\nhave been processed to stay soft and spread-\nable when cold.\nWhipped margarine — This has had\nair beaten into it, making it fluffy and easy\nto spread. \nLiquid margarine — Liquid margarine\ncomes in squeezable bottles, making it con-\nvenient for picnics and other events away\nfrom home.  It is specially blended so that it\ndoes not become too thick to squeeze out of\nthe bottle.  It is also handy for basting and\nfor foods such as corn on the cob and waffles.\nLike butter, regular margarine is about\n80 percent fat (actually, law requires this\npercentage of fat for the product to be\nlabeled margarine) and has the same num-\nber of calories.  One tablespoon contains\nabout 100 calories and 11 grams of fat. \nFor years, margarine was thought to be\na much healthier choice than butter because\nit contains less saturated fat than butter and\nno cholesterol (because it is not made from\nanimal fat).  Although that’s true, margarine\nis high in trans fats, which also are linked\nto cardiovascular disease.  In addition, mar-\ngarine is high in calories.  Therefore, it\nshould be used in moderation.\nSofter margarines, such as those  that\nare liquid or sold in tubs, are considered a\nstitute something else.  Instead, save the\ndish for special occasions.\nMargarine\nHydrogenation, the process used to make\nliquid oils solid at room temperature, made\npossible a shift from animal fat to vegetable\nfat as a substitute for butter.  The resulting\nproduct — which may be blended with other\nmilk products or animal fats (such as lard\nor tallow) and salt for taste — is margarine.\nIt has been used as a butter substitute since\nthe late 19th century.  Sometimes it is\nreferred to as oleomargarine or oleo.  Oleo\nmeans oil and refers to the vegetable oil\nbase of margarine. \nIn addition to regular margarine, the\ndairy case may contain these variations:\nSalted or unsalted margarine — As the\nname suggests, salt has been added for\nflavoring or left out.\nLard is usually sold at the supermarket\nin the dairy case or near the refrigerated\nmeat section.  When purchasing lard, make\nsure it is tightly wrapped to prevent the\nproduct from absorbing other flavors.  Look\nat the label to determine whether it should\nbe stored at room temperature or in the\nrefrigerator.  Lard also can be frozen if it is\ntightly wrapped.\nPreparation Tips\nBecause lard is softer and oilier than butter\nand contains less water, some cooks believe\nit is the best choice for making pie crust.\nThe reduced water content in lard helps\nmake the crust especially light, flaky, and\ncrumbly.\nServing Suggestions\nBecause lard is so high in saturated fat, it\nshould be used sparingly at best. \nVegetable Shortening\nVegetable shortening, usually sold in coffee-\ncan-sized canisters, is a solid fat made from\nvegetable oils.  It gets its name from a\nproperty all fats have in common: they\n“shorten” gluten strands in flour-based\nproducts, which results in baked goods that\nhave a tender texture.\nAlthough the base of shortening is oil,\nit has undergone a process known as hydro-\ngenation to make the shortening solid at\nroom temperature.  Trans fatty acids are\ncreated by hydrogenation.  This type of fat\nis associated with increased risk for coronary\nartery disease.\nPreparation Tips\nPlain and butter-flavored vegetable short-\nenings are sold in supermarkets.  Plain short-\nening has little taste.  Both types can be used\nin place of other fats in baking and cooking. \nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n393\nFoods that contain trans fat.\nsaturated fat.  (See Chapter 2, A Comparison\nof Fats, page 27.)  Another positive aspect\nis that canola oil contains omega-3 fatty\nacids, which are thought to play a role in\nreducing cardiovascular disease. \nPreparation Tips\nBecause canola oil is relatively bland, some\ncooks combine it with olive oil to add addi-\ntional flavor.\nServing Suggestions\nCanola oil is suitable both for cooking and\nfor salad dressings.  It is also used as an\ningredient in spreads that can be substi-\ntuted for butter or margarine.\nCoconut Oil\nPressed from the boiled nut meats of fresh\nor dried coconut, coconut oil is one of the\nfew non-animal highly saturated fats.\nServing Suggestions\nShortening results in baked goods that are\nlight and fluffy.  Because of the health draw-\nbacks of hydrogenation, however, shorten-\ning should be used sparingly. \nOils \nCooking Oils\nCanola Oil\nCanola oil is a bland-tasting oil made from\nrapeseed.  Its health advantages over other\noils has made it a popular choice in the\nUnited States, although it is also used\naround the world.

Only olive oil has more monoun-\n394\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nPreparation Tips\nIn the United States, flaxseed oil generally is\nnot used for cooking purposes.  Instead, the\ngrassy-tasting oil is often sold at health stores\nas a supplement.  The oil is more commonly\nused elsewhere in the world for cooking,\nparticularly Eastern Europe.  Flaxseed oil’s\nlow saturated fat content means that it is\nmore prone to rancidity than oils with higher\nsaturated fat content.  Therefore, it should\nalways be stored in the refrigerator. \nServing Suggestions\nBaking with flaxseed meal is one way to\nincorporate this healthful oil into your diet.\nFlaxseed meal is available in the health foods\nsection of most supermarkets. \nOlive Oil\nIf there is one oil that gourmands and nutri-\ntionists agree on, it is olive oil.  Low in\nsaturated fat and rich in heart-healthy\nmonounsaturated fats and flavor, olive oil\nis an excellent addition to any kitchen and\nmeal.  Sometimes it is even referred to as\nthe “king of oils.”\nsautéing and frying — two cooking meth-\nods that should be used in moderation.\nMany cooks believe corn oil helps make\nsautéed foods and fried foods crispier.  \nServing Suggestions\nCorn oil can have a strong flavor, which is\nwhy it is probably best used for cooking\ninstead of serving “cold,” such as in a salad\ndressing.  Corn oil’s stronger flavor works\nwell in margarines, but many people prefer\nthe taste of reduced-fat or light margarines\nmade with corn oil. \nCottonseed Oil\nWidely used at the turn of the century,\ncottonseed oil often is considered the orig-\ninal vegetable oil of the United States.  Its\nfat is mostly polyunsaturated.\nPreparation Tips\nCottonseed oil is used mainly as salad oil\nor in cooking.  It is often used in processed\nfoods because it is inexpensive.\nServing Suggestions\nThis oil has a neutral, clean taste that does\nnot mask other flavors.  It is used mainly by\nfood manufacturers and is not common in\nhome use.\nFlaxseed (Linseed) Oil\nThe tall stems of the flax plant have many\nuses:  they contain fibers that can be made\ninto linen and high-grade paper.  Oil also\ncan be pressed from its shiny brown, oval-\nshaped seeds.  Flaxseed is also sometimes\nknown as linseed oil and is a common\ningredient in paints, varnishes, and inks.\nThis oil is low in saturated fat and high in\nomega-3 fatty acids, which may help protect\nagainst cardiovascular disease. \nNearly 90 percent of coconut oil is satu-\nrated fat, topping even butter and lard in\nsaturated fat content. \nAlthough its high saturated fat content\nmakes coconut oil an unhealthful fat choice,\nit helps coconut oil resist rancidity.  Coconut\noil is a common ingredient in commercial\nbaked goods, ice cream, and salad dressings.\nIt is particularly common in non-dairy cof-\nfee creamers and whipped toppings.  The\nwhiff of coconut that arises from an open\nbottle of suntan lotion should also tell you\nthat coconut oil has nonfood uses.\nPreparation Tips\nCoconut oil is popular in cuisine from\nSoutheast Asia, the Pacific, and the West\nIndies.  For these cuisines, cooks often can\nsubstitute a more healthful oil or mix coconut\noil with another oil to reduce saturated fat\nin a dish.  Be aware that there is coconut oil\nin coconut cream and coconut milk.\nServing Suggestions\nBecause of its saturated fat content, coconut\noil should be used sparingly. \nCorn Oil\nCorn oil is one of the most widely used cook-\ning oils.  It is pressed from the inside (endosperm)\nof corn kernels.  It is more strongly flavored than\nother oils.  Corn oil that has undergone less pro-\ncessing, known as unrefined corn oil, can be\nfound in specialty stores.  It is more dense than\nrefined corn oil and has a darker gold color and\na hint of popcorn flavor.  Corn oil has a high\nlevel of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid and\nless saturated fat than many other oils.  This is\none reason it is used to make margarine. \nPreparation Tips\nBecause of its high smoke point (410°\nFahrenheit), corn oil is commonly used for\nOne of the first oils to be made by\nhumans, olive oil is pressed from olives that\nare picked when their color turns to pur-\nplish black and their skin develops an oily\nsheen.  The rich flavor of olive oil varies\naccording to where the olives are grown and\nthe type of tree that produces them.  For\nexample, Spanish olive oil has a strong,\nsome would say overwhelming, flavor.  Oils\nproduced from California olive trees are\nsaid to have a mild, almost sweet flavor.\nOlive oil from Italy, however, is usually con-\nsidered the best.\nU.S. consumers can find a wide range\nof olive oils in supermarkets and specialty\nshops.  Unrefined olive oil, which is less\nprocessed, is considered the most flavorful\nand has a greenish cast.  Fresh, refined olive\noil should have a sweet, somewhat nutty\nflavor and a golden color.  A rule of thumb\nis that the more deeply colored the oil, the\nmore flavorful it will be. \nOlive oil is also graded by the\nInternational Olive Oil Council in these\nways:\nExtra virgin — Considered the finest\nolive oil, extra virgin is made without heat\nor solvents, from the first pressing of the\nolives.  It is the most flavorful and the most\nexpensive, and so it is most often used for\nseasoning.\nVirgin — Also made without heat\nor solvents, virgin olive oil also comes\nfrom the first pressing of the olives.  It\nis more acidic but has a less intense flavor\nthan extra virgin.  It is widely used in\ncooking.\nRegular or pure — More subdued in\nflavor than virgin olive oil, regular (pure)\nolive oil is extracted with heat or solvent\nand may be made from pressed olives that\nhave been washed and treated to extract\nmore oil from them.  This type of oil is\noften blended with virgin olive oil.\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n395\nItalian and Mediterranean cuisines take full\nadvantage of olive oil’s robust flavor and\nhealth benefits.\nPalm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil\nOften thought to be the same thing, palm\noil and palm kernel oil are actually two sep-\narate oils.  Palm oil, which is reddish brown,\nis extracted from the pulp of the fruit of the\npalm.  Palm kernel oil, which is yellowish\nwhite and has a mild flavor, is extracted from\nthe nut or kernel of the palm.  Both, how-\never, have this in common: they are among\nthe highest of all oils in saturated fat.\nPalm oil is often used in margarine and\nin commercially prepared gravies and soups.\nLight — Don’t be misled by the title\n— light olive oil has the same amount of\ncalories and fat as regular olive oil.  “Light”\nrefers simply to color, fragrance, and flavor.\nLight olive oil also may be referred to as\n“mild.”  Generally, this type of olive oil is\ndismissed by serious cooks.  It does have\nthe advantage of having the highest smoke\npoint of all oils (468° Fahrenheit).\nPreparation Tips\nGenerally, pressing and process-\ning are done after the olives are\ncollected in autumn.\nShipments of freshly\npressed olive oil begin\narriving in specialty\nstores in the spring.\nBecause most types of\nolive oil have a low\nsmoke point, olive oil\nis not suited for deep-\nfrying or sautéing. The\nbest-tasting olive oil is\nthe freshest.\nServing Suggestions\nOlive oil is best used in sauces,\nsalad dressings, and marinades, where\nits flavor can be put to full advantage.\nOlives, avocados,\npeanuts, and the\noils made from\nthem are a source\nof monounsatu-\nrated fat.\nIt is also commonly used as a medium to\nfry potato chips.  Palm kernel oil has various\nuses, including in nondairy creamers, dress-\nings, whipped creams and toppings, baked\ngoods, and candy. \nPreparation Tips\nPalm kernel oil and palm oil are generally\nused only for commercial food production\npurposes.  They are not typically sold in\nsupermarkets or specialty stores.\nServing Suggestions\nPersons following a healthful diet would\ndo well to avoid both palm oil and palm\nkernel oil.  Check the list of ingredients on\n396\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nthe products you buy.  Avoid fatty prod-\nucts that contain these oils.  Skim milk is a\nfar healthier option for a coffee lightener.\nPeanut Oil\nOne of the first native North American\nsources of vegetable oil, the peanut is com-\nprised of about 50 percent oil.  This oil is\nextracted by pressing steam-cooked peanuts. \nPeanut oil is high in monounsaturated\nfat and has the added advantage of having a\nrelatively high smoke point (410° Fahrenheit). \nAmerican peanut oils are often mild in\nflavor.  Chinese peanut oils have a stronger\npeanut flavor because they are less processed.\nPeanut oil keeps well when stored in a cool,\ndark place.  However, its shelf life is longer\nwhen it is refrigerated.\nPreparation Tips\nPeanut oil’s high smoke point makes it an\nexcellent choice for deep-frying, a cooking\ntechnique always best used in moderation. \nServing Suggestions\nA healthier use for peanut oil is to serve it as a\nsalad dressing.  It also adds a delicate flavor to\nmayonnaise recipes.  The flavor of peanut oil\nalso complements Indian and Asian cuisine. \nSafflower Oil\nSafflower oil is made from the seeds of the\nthistle-like safflower plant.  Safflower oil\nhas little flavor or color, but it is rich in\npolyunsaturated fat.  It is also one of the\noils with the least amount of saturated fat.\nSafflower is light in color and, like other\noils that are rich in polyunsaturated fat, is\na good all-around oil. \nPreparation Tips\nSafflower oil can be substituted for other\noils in nearly any recipe.  It has a high smoke\npoint (450° Fahrenheit), making it a good\nchoice for sautéing and deep-frying, two\ntechniques best used in moderation. \nServing Suggestions\nSafflower oil is often used in salad dressings\nbecause it does not solidify when chilled.\nIt has an oily texture and a nutty flavor, mak-\ning it a good substitute for peanut oil.\nSoybean Oil\nThe soybean has the distinction of being\nthe plant used most often to produce veg-\netable oil.

About\n15 percent of the fat provided by soybean\noil is saturated. \nSoybean oil is one of the most com-\nmonly used oils for commercial food pur-\nposes.  It has a smoke point of 410°\nFahrenheit, making it useful for frying.\nHowever, sometimes manufacturers may\nhydrogenate the oil, decreasing its health\nattributes.  It is commonly used in mar-\ngarine and shortening. \nPreparation Tips\nAlthough soybean oil is versatile for cook-\ning, some people find that it has a somewhat\nfishy taste and heavy texture.  Use caution\nwhen using soybean oil by itself as a\nseasoning or dressing.\nServing Suggestions\nWhen soybean oil is used as a cooking\nmedium, its flavor complements Asian and\nIndian cuisines. \nSunflower Oil\nSunflower oil is pressed from the seeds of\nthis well-known, towering yellow member\nof the daisy family.

It is also expensive.\nOil produced in the United States is con-\nsidered less pleasing by serious cooks, but it\nis more moderately priced.\nPreparation Tips\nAlmond oil becomes rancid quickly and must\nbe refrigerated.  When using synthetic almond\nflavoring in recipes, be aware that it often is\nnot made from almonds (instead peach pits\nmay be used) and may have a bitter taste. \nServing Suggestions\nAlmond oil or flavoring is used in numerous\ndesserts and sweets, including the famous\nGerman holiday specialty marzipan.\nAlmond oil may be used as a flavoring in\ndishes in which you would have used the\nnut itself. \nGrape-seed Oil\nThis pale-yellow oil has both a taste and an\naroma that reflect where it came from —\nit is extracted from the tiny grape seed.\nOften, these seeds are left over after wine-\nmaking.\nGrape-seed oil is produced mostly in\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, but it is easily\nfound in the United States in both grocery\nand specialty stores.  It is low in saturated\nfat and contains mostly polyunsaturated\nfat.  Although light in consistency and color,\ngrape-seed oil can have a relatively strong\nand distinctive taste. \nPreparation Tips\nGrape-seed oil’s high smoke point (445°\nFahrenheit) makes it a good all-purpose oil\nfor deep-frying.  It can be used to gently\nsauté foods.  Grape-seed oil does not\nbecome rancid quickly and can be stored\nat room temperature.\nPeanuts\nSunflower seeds\nPreparation Tips\nSunflower oil is considered an excellent all-\naround oil.  Its very mild taste makes it\nextremely versatile for both cooking and\nseasoning, particularly when cooks do not\nwant to mask the taste of other foods.\nServing Suggestions\nBecause sunflower oil is relatively inex-\npensive and has little or no taste, it can be\ncombined with more expensive specialty\noils in foods such as salad dressings. \nSpecialty Oils \nAlmond Oil\nA favorite for cakes, desserts, and candies,\nthis clear, sweet, pale-yellow oil is pressed\nfrom either bitter or sweet almond kernels.\nBoth flavor and consistency may depend\non where the oil was made.  In European\ncountries, the oil comes from the “bitter\nalmond,” which is similar to a peach pit.\nWhen the bitter substance in the oil has\nbeen removed, the oil is then used to make\ncandy.

Purchase sesame oil in glass\nor metal containers because it goes rancid\nmore quickly in plastic.  Sesame oil keeps\nfor about a month in a cool place.\nServing Suggestions\nDrizzle sesame oil lightly over dishes just\nafter cooking.  A small amount adds a dis-\ntinct flavor and aroma. \nWalnut Oil\nOil pressed from walnuts has a strong, nutty\nflavor.  It is also high in polyunsaturated\nfat and low in saturated fat.  Although wide-\nly available, walnut oil remains expensive.\nBlander, cheaper versions can be found.\nPreparation Tips\nBecause of its intense flavor, walnut oil is\noften mixed with lighter oils.  Walnut oil\nalso has a low smoke point and will become\nrancid quickly if not refrigerated.\nServing Suggestions\nWalnut oil is excellent as a salad dressing\nor drizzled over pasta or cooked vegetables.\nLike any nut oil, you can use walnut oil when\nthe nut itself would be complementary.\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n399\nSweeteners \nBasics\nSweeteners come from various sources.\nThey have been sought throughout history\nfor their pleasing taste and many uses.  Just\nstop and think of what you have eaten\ntoday.  This morning you may have sweet-\nened your tea with honey and put maple\nsyrup on your pancakes.  At lunch, you may\nhave eaten a snack food made with corn\nsyrup  — a form of sugar — and, perhaps,\nyou finished off dinner with a cake made\nwith the most commonly used and best\nknown sweetener of all, granulated sugar.\nThe science of sweetness, however, goes\nbeyond the source of the foodstuff for the\nsweetener.  At a molecular level, approxi-\nmately 100 chemicals are sweet.  They all\nare referred to as sugars.  Common ones you\nmay have heard of include the following:\nSucrose — Table sugar is the crystal-\nlized form of sucrose.  Sucrose is referred\nto as a simple sugar.  It is naturally occur-\nring in all plants that depend on sunlight\nto produce energy.  Sugar cane and sugar\nbeets are among the most abundant pro-\nducers of sucrose in the plant kingdom.\nGlucose — A simple sugar that plays\nmany key roles in the body, glucose is a sim-\nple sugar found in fruits, honey, cereal,\nflour, and nuts.\nFructose — The sweetest of all sugars\nis found in abundance in honey and fruit.\nLactose — Another simple sugar, lac-\ntose occurs only in milk.  It is often added\nto other foods during processing to improve\ntaste.\nMaltose — The result of a chemical\nprocessing that uses starch and malt, mal-\ntose has numerous commercial food uses.  It\nis often used in beer, bread, and baby food,\namong other things.\nPectin — A complex sugar, pectin is\nfound in apples, citrus fruits, and some veg-\netables.  It is a form of fiber. \nNutrition\nAll sugars are carbohydrates and play a\nkey role in providing the body with ener-\ngy.  The calorie content depends on the\ntype of sweetener used.  For example,\ntable sugar has about 16 calories per tea-\nspoon, and honey has about 21 calories per\nteaspoon.\nGenerally, sweeteners often are referred\nto as having “empty calories.”  They contain\nfew or no vitamins, minerals, or other nutri-\nents.  And, because they are appealing, it\ncan be easy to eat too much.  This excess\nQUICK TIP\nAlthough refrigeration helps to\nprevent oils from becoming rancid,\nthe colder temperature may result \nin some oils becoming cloudy or\nthicker.  This change does not affect\nthe oil’s nutritional value, quality, or\ntaste.  At room temperature, the oil\nwill liquefy and, usually, clarify again.\nWHAT ARE ESSENTIAL OILS?\nEssential oils are extracted from vari-\nous plants for use in perfumes, for\naromatherapy purposes, or for use in\nmedicines as flavorings.  Common\nessential oils used for their scent\ninclude rose oil, geranium oil, and\nlavender oil.  Essential oils used for\nflavorings are derived from lemons,\ncloves, peppermint leaves, and\nspearmint leaves.\nWalnuts\nextracted from the crushed cane or sliced\nbeets is then processed to make sugar.\nTypically, the juice is boiled, and then\nchemicals are added to the solution to puri-\nfy it.  The resulting syrup is known as\nmolasses.  Continued processing separates\ncrystals from the molasses and other by-\nproducts.  The crystals are then dried and\npackaged as sugar. \nThe most common types of sugars\nfound in supermarkets are as follows:\nGranulated white sugar — Often\nreferred to as table sugar, this is the most\ncommonly used type of sugar.  There are\ndifferent grades of granulated white sugar,\nand the size of the sugar crystal determines\nhow it is used.  Regular, extra-fine, or fine\nsugar is the sugar found most commonly\nin the sugar bowl and called for in most\ncookbook recipes.  Superfine sugar or ultra-\nfine sugar has the smallest crystal size and\nis often used in cakes and meringues and\nto sweeten fruits or iced drinks.  Superfine\nsugar dissolves the most easily in water.\nBrown sugar — Brown sugar is sold in\ndark and light varieties.  It is simply white\nsugar crystals coated in a molasses syrup to\nadd a natural mellow flavor and color.  Dark\nbrown sugar has more color and a stronger\nmolasses flavor.  Its fuller flavor is called for\nin recipes for gingerbread and baked beans.\nLighter types are usually used in baking.\nNeither type of brown sugar is considered\nraw sugar, although they do look similar to it.\nConfectioners’ sugar — Also known as\npowdered sugar, this is granulated sugar\nthat has been ground into a powder.  A\nsmall amount of cornstarch can be added to\nprevent clumping.  Confectioners’ sugar\ntypically is used to make icing, in whipping\ncream, and as a topping for desserts. \nDecorating or coarse sugar — Also\ncalled sugar crystals, decorating sugar has\ngranules about four times larger than those\n400\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nSugar\nSugar was once considered as valuable as\ngold because of its scarcity.  Its use spread\nthroughout the Western world after\nexplorers, then armies, conquered parts of\nancient Arabia.  In early times, it was sold\nand traded in blocks, which were then\nground into powder.\nAlthough sugar is a carbohydrate that\noccurs naturally in every fruit and veg-\netable, it is found in the greatest quantities\nas sucrose in sugar cane, which is grown\nin the tropics, and sugar beets, which can\nbe cultivated in colder climates.  Juice\ncould make it difficult to maintain a healthy\nweight.  Heavy use of sweeteners also may\nincrease the risk of tooth decay, which is\nwhy it is important to brush after eating a\nsweet food, particularly one that is sticky,\nsuch as caramel.  For these reasons, it is best\nto minimize the amount of sweeteners in\nyour diet.\nSelection and Storage \nThese factors depend on the type of sweet-\nener.  Check the following sections, which\nprovide more information on common\ntypes of sweeteners, for specifics.\nThere are many types of sweeteners.\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n401\nHoney\nIn ancient times, this thick, sweet, golden\nliquid was thought of as a healing agent, a\ngift from the gods, and a symbol of wealth.\nToday, this sweetener is still revered,\nalthough not as highly, for being a natural\nsource of sweet flavor.\nHoney is made by bees.  The basic\ningredient is nectar gathered from flowers.\nEnzymes in the bee’s saliva convert the\nnectar into honey.  Essentially, this is a\nsimple matter of chemistry, in which the\nsugar (sucrose) in nectar is converted into\nfructose and glucose. \nAs the phrase “busy as a bee” suggests,\nbees work hard to make honey.  The bee\nmust make up to 100,000 round trips from\nminimize its role in our diet.  Make a little\ngo a long way.  To do so:\n•\nAdd spices, such as cinnamon or nut-\nmeg, to foods to jazz up flavor while reduc-\ning sweeteners used in them.\n•\nAdd fruit or yogurt to foods such as\ncereal, instead of a sweetener.\n•\nAvoid sweetened soft drinks, and\nminimize fruit juices with added sugar.\nBetter yet, drink water.\n•\nCheck labels for sugar or any one of the\nchemical names for it:  glucose, sucrose,\nlactose, or fructose, to name just a few.\nAlso, watch for corn syrup or malt syrup,\ntwo more widely used sweeteners in food\nmanufacturing.\nServing Suggestions\nManufacturers can reduce the fat in many\nfoods, but it is hard to do without sugar.\nSugar is a key component of baked goods\nand desserts and is used to enhance the\nflavor of everything from sweet-and-sour\nstir-fry to ham.  The amount of sugar used\nin a recipe often can be reduced by up to\nhalf without compromising the flavor.\nHowever, this is not always the case, so a\nbit of trial and error is required.\nof regular granulated sugar.  It undergoes\na special processing method to make it resis-\ntant to color change and breakdown at high\ntemperatures.  This makes it useful for mak-\ning fondants or liqueurs.\nSanding sugar — Also called colored\nsugar, sanding sugar is used for decorating\nand is characterized by large crystals.  This\nis desirable in decorating because it gives\nthe food a sparkling appearance.\nFlavored sugar — This is simply gran-\nulated sugar that has been combined or\nscented with various ingredients such as\ncinnamon or vanilla.  \nFruit sugar — Slightly finer than\n“regular” sugar, fruit sugar is used in dry\nmixes such as gelatin desserts, pudding\nmixes, and drink mixes.  The more uni-\nform crystals prevent separation or settling\nof smaller crystals to the bottom of the box.\nIn addition to sweetening items, sugar\nplays an important role in making food.  It\nis a critical ingredient in bread, in which it\nprovides food for yeast and thus helps bread\nto rise.  It also adds to the flavor and crust\ncolor of baked goods and helps extend shelf\nlife.\nIn large amounts, sugar inhibits the\ngrowth of yeast and molds in jams and\njellies.  Sugar syrups protect frozen and\ncanned foods from browning and wither-\ning.  In ice cream, beverages, baked goods,\nand other products, sugar adds bulk,\ntexture, and body.  It is also used in many\ncondiments, such as ketchup and salad\ndressing, where it blends flavors, reduces\nacidity, and helps create a smooth texture.\nSugar has a long shelf life.  Kept tightly\nwrapped and in a cool, dark place, it will\nkeep for months or even years. \nPreparation Tips\nSugar adds flavor and calories but little else.\nTherefore, it is best for most of us to\nSUGAR IN THE RAW\nMany so-called raw sugars are\nmarketed in the United States.  Two\npopular types of raw sugar are the\ncoarse-textured dry Demerara sugar,\nwhich is produced in the South\nAmerican country of Guyana, and\nthe moist, fine-textured muscovado,\nor Barbados, sugar.  Demerara sugar\nis light brown and is characterized by\nlarge golden crystals that are slightly\nsticky.  It is excellent as a topping for\nhot cereals and is widely used in\nspecialty coffee houses.  Muscovado,\nor Barbados, sugar is a dark, rich\nbrown sugar and retains a strong\nmolasses flavor.  Turbinado sugar is\nanother variation of raw sugar.  It \nhas undergone steam processing to\nremove some of the lingering molasses\nin it.  Its crystals are light-golden and\ngenerally are larger than those of\nregular sugar. Turbinado sugar tastes\nvery similar to brown sugar.\nSugar cane\nhive to flower and back just to make a quart\nof honey. \nHoney is divided into three basic cate-\ngories:\n•\nLiquid honey, which is extracted from\nthe comb\n•\nChunk-style honey, a liquid honey with\npieces of the honeycomb\n•\nComb honey, a square or round piece of\nthe honeycomb, with the honey inside\nWithin these three categories are\nhundreds of different types of honey.\nHoney’s color ranges from light to dark.\nThe flavor ranges from mild to strong and\ndepends on the type of flower from which\nthe nectar was taken.  In general, the darker\nthe honey, the stronger the flavor.\nOne tablespoon of honey has about 64\ncalories.  Although sugar has about 48\ncalories per tablespoon, honey does have\nsome advantages over sugar.  Its sweeten-\ning power is stronger.  And honey, unlike\n402\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nbut are commonly used in food manufac-\nturing because they do not readily form\ncrystals.  Corn syrup is perhaps the most\nwidely used grain syrup.  It is made by pro-\ncessing corn starch and is available in light\nand dark forms.  Malt syrup, made from\nevaporated corn mash and sprouted barley,\nis another common grain syrup.  It has a\nstrong flavor and is used in bread making.\nGolden syrup — Popular in England,\ngolden syrup is similar in consistency to\ncorn syrup and has a golden color.  It is\nmade from sugar cane juice and has a toast-\ned flavor.  It is also known as light treacle.\nMaple syrup — The best known of all\nsyrups, maple syrup is made by boiling the\nsap of certain species of maple trees (Acer\nsaccharum) found mainly in Quebec, New\nYork, and Vermont.  This clear, subtly\nflavored syrup is sweeter than sugar and has\na distinctive flavor.\nMolasses — Molasses, a dark viscous\nsyrup, is a by-product of the sugar-making\nprocess and is generally used for flavoring\nfoods or as a glaze.  It is poured over foods\nas a condiment in some regions of the\nUnited States.  Light molasses is produced\nduring the first stages of the sugar-extraction\nprocess.  Dark molasses is made during the\nsecond stage and is referred to as unsulfured\nmolasses.  Blackstrap molasses, made during\nthe final stage of sugar production, is darkly\ncolored and has an intense flavor. \nBlack treacle — Black treacle is a\nthick, black, and sticky syrup.  It is very\nsimilar to molasses and is a by-product of\nthe sugar-production process.  Black trea-\ncle is sweeter than molasses.  A lighter-\ncolored and lighter-flavored form is also\navailable.  Both are more common in\nEngland.\nPalm syrup — This dark, thick, and\nintensely flavored syrup is made from\npalms.  It is an ingredient in some Asian\nother sweeteners, does contain trace\namounts of vitamins and minerals.\nIf kept in a sealed container and a cool\ndark place, honey can be kept for a long\ntime.  Cooler temperatures, such as in a\nrefrigerator, may cause honey to thicken.\nWarming it up, however, restores honey’s\nappearance.  Its taste is not altered.  However,\nvery warm temperatures can change honey’s\nflavor.\nPreparation Tips\nMost honey sold in stores is pasteurized,\nfiltered, and blended.  Some cooks buy\nhoney directly from an apiary because they\nbelieve that these processes alter or dull\nhoney’s delicate flavor.  Honey also can be\nused as a substitute for sugar (about 1/2\ncup honey for 1 cup of sugar) in many\nrecipes.  Keep in mind, however, that honey\nmay cause food to brown more quickly.  In\naddition, you will need to reduce the liquid\nin the recipe. \nServing Suggestions\nHoney adds moisture to cakes, breads, and\nother confections.  It is also an excellent\ntopping for most baked goods.  One other\ncommon use is as a glaze for meats such\nas ham. \nSyrups\nSugar also comes in syrups — thick,\nviscous, sweet liquids that have various\ntastes and uses.  The most common types\ninclude the following: \nCane syrup — Thick and extremely\nsweet, cane syrup is made from sugar cane.\nIt is a common ingredient in Caribbean\nand Creole recipes.  \nGrain  syrups — Sweet syrups can be\nmade from several grains:  barley, wheat,\ncorn, or rice.  They are not as sweet as sugar\na distinctive taste that cannot be duplicated,\nchocolate is the universal favorite when it\ncomes to flavor.  In fact, ancient cultures\neven thought it was a gift from the gods, one\nwith medicinal properties.  It is perhaps the\nmost popular sweet flavoring worldwide.\nChocolate is made from the beans of\nthe cacao tree, which grows in the warm,\nhumid weather of the equatorial regions.\nLike coffee beans, the beans of the cacao\ntree must be dried, chopped, and roasted\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n403\nbefore use.  The processing of the beans\nresults in a dark brown liquid called choco-\nlate liquor.  This fluid — which is 55 percent\nfat, 17 percent carbohydrate, and 11 per-\ncent protein — is used to make virtually all\ntypes of chocolate.\nDifferent types of chocolate contain vary-\ning amounts of cocoa butter — a vegetable\nfat derived from the cacao bean — and solids\nfrom the cacao bean.  Chocolate types\ninclude the following:\nHONEY AND INFANTS\nMany parents are unaware that honey\nshould not be served to children\nyounger than 1 year because it may\ncontain a small amount of botulism\ntoxin.  The amount of this toxin in\nhoney is not enough to harm adults\nand children older than 1 year\nbecause their immune systems have\nmatured.  But in infants, this toxin\ncan be life-threatening.\nrecipes and usually is sold only at specialty\nmarkets.\nPreparation Tips\nMost grain syrups are used commercially.\nIn contrast, maple syrup is typically used at\nhome.  Pure maple syrup is found in super-\nmarkets.  However, pancake syrups com-\nmonly contain either a small portion of\nmaple syrup or maple flavoring that is then\nmixed with a grain syrup.  Many types of\nsyrups are used to make candy.  Keep in\nmind that syrups high in sugar have a higher\nboiling point than water. \nServing Suggestions\nMaple syrup is typically used as a topping\nfor waffles and pancakes.  Numerous types\nof syrups can be used as glazes for meats\n(ham, in particular, and also poultry or fish)\nor on top of vegetables, such as carrots.\nMolasses also makes an excellent glaze. \nSugar syrups make an excellent glaze\nfor pound cakes and bundt cakes. \nChocolate\nIf there is one flavoring that everyone seems\nto love, it’s chocolate.  Rich and sweet, with\nUnsweetened — Sometimes referred to\nas baker’s chocolate, this dark, rich, and\nbitter chocolate does not have any sugar\nadded to it.  It is usually added to recipes in\nwhich sugar is an ingredient.\nBittersweet — This dark, rich choco-\nlate is comprised mostly of chocolate liquor,\nmeaning it is rich in cacao solids, but it may\nhave some milk solids and other flavorings\nadded to it.\nSemisweet — A favorite of makers of\nchocolate chip cookies, semisweet choco-\nlate contains more milk solids and other\nflavorings than bittersweet chocolate. \nMilk — The sweetest of all chocolates,\nmilk chocolate has a light-brown color and\na mild chocolate flavor.\nWhite — This ivory-colored chocolate\ncontains no cacao bean solids, but it does\ncontain cocoa butter, which gives it a rich,\ncreamy mouth-feel.  It differs from white\nalmond bark or candy coating, which uses\nvegetable fat as a base instead of cocoa butter. \n404\nPart II:  Encyclopedia of Foods\nall cocoa butter has been removed from it.\nA tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder\ncontains about 15 calories and just under 1\ngram of fat.\nCocoa typically is not sweetened and is\nadded to recipes in which sugar is used.\nThere are two main types of cocoa:  natural\nand “Dutch-process.”  Natural cocoa is light\nin color and has a strong chocolate flavor.\nIn contrast, Dutch-process has a milder\ntaste but is darker in color. \nChocolate’s nutritional value varies.\nOne ounce of unsweetened chocolate has\n145 calories, 16 grams of fat, and 9 grams\nof saturated fat.  In comparison, an ounce\nof semisweet chocolate has 135 calories, 9\ngrams of fat, and 5 grams of saturated fat.\nChocolate also is a source of protein and\ncontains trace amounts of vitamins and\nsome minerals, such as potassium. \nChocolate should be stored in a cool,\ndark place and can be kept for several\nImitation chocolate — Typically used\nin baking chips, imitation chocolate replaces\nsome or all of the cocoa fat with other veg-\netable fats.  It is high in fat (mostly saturated\nfat) and does contain caffeine. \nCocoa is another common type of\nchocolate.  It is a powdered form of choco-\nlate made from chocolate liquor.  However,\nWHAT IS LIQUID SUGAR?\nLiquid sugars were first developed\nbefore processing made distribution\nof granulated sugars practical.  It \nis generally used for commercial\npurposes in products in which dis-\nsolved granulated sugar is desired.  A\ndarker liquid sugar is also available.\nIt is called amber liquid and is darker \nand has more of a cane sugar flavor.  \nInvert sugar is another type of\nliquid sugar.  It helps prevent sugar\ncrystallization and also helps the\nproduct it is in retain moisture.\nInvert sugar is sweeter than regular\ntable sugar and is generally available\nonly for commercial uses.\nMade from maple syrup, maple sugar is\ntwice as sweet as regular table sugar.\nARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS\nAspartame (better known as Nutra-\nSweet), acesulfame-K, saccharin, and\nsucralose are synthetic substances\nthat have been approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration.\nThey are used commercially and in\nthe home to sweeten products.  They\ncontain few or no calories but are\nseveral hundred times sweeter than\nsugar.  For more information, see\nChapter 2, page 21.\nmonths.  Dark chocolate can be stored for up\nto a year.  Varying temperatures will cause\nlighter, whitish areas to appear on chocolate\n— something that does not affect taste and\nis resolved when the chocolate is melted.\nChocolate also can be frozen, but it must be\nwrapped tightly to prevent moisture from\ndamaging the chocolate when it is thawed.\nPreparation Tips\nCocoa can be used as a substitute for choco-\nlate in recipes.  However, when this sub-\nstitution is made, fat needs to be added to\nthe cocoa to ensure that the final product\nwill be moist.  Each square of unsweetened\nFats, Oils, & Sweeteners\n405\nchocolate can be replaced with 3 table-\nspoons of cocoa and 1 tablespoon of cook-\ning oil.\nMelting chocolate is difficult because\nit burns easily.  For that reason, it is best to\nuse a double boiler to melt chocolate.  Avoid\nsplashing any water into the melting choco-\nlate because doing so can cause the choco-\nlate to become hard and thus unusable.\nChopping the chocolate into small bits\nbefore melting it helps achieve the smooth,\neven consistency that many recipes require.\nAlways look at the ingredient list of the\nchocolate you buy to ensure that you are\nnot getting a substitute.\nServing Suggestions\nChocolate is the classic dessert ingredient,\nproviding the flavoring power for cakes,\ntortes, frostings, mousses, creams, and other\nsweets too numerous to count. \nChocolate’s high fat content and\nhigh calories mean it should be used in\nmoderation.  Use chocolate as an accent\nto a healthier food — such as a dip for\nstrawberries — rather than as the main\ningredient.  Reduced-calorie hot cocoa\nmixes are an excellent way to feed a\nchocolate craving without the fat and\ncalories.  Or, simply save chocolate for\nspecial occasions. \nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\n407\nAcute:  Term used to describe disorders or symptoms that occur\nabruptly or that run a short course; opposite of Chronic\nAerobic:  Requiring the presence of oxygen.
